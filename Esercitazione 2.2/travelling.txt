<p> How To Use Second, Third and Mixed Conditional Clauses in English - Quiz + Audio Lesson </p>
<p> Hello, I'm Jane at DailyStep English. </p>
<p> This free quiz and audio lesson will help you learn how to use English Second, Third and Mixed Conditional Clauses correctly. Even advanced learners sometimes make mistakes to check your understanding here. If you are new to DailyStep English - welcome! You can sign up here for 5 Free Audio Lessons and to be on my mailing list. </p>
<p> SECOND AND THIRD CONDITIONALS </p>
<p> by Jane Lawson at DailyStep.com </p>
<p> Many English learners say this topic is confusing. But really, it is not difficult if you learn the structure. My last lesson covered Zero and First Conditionals, so today we are going to look at the last 3 types: Second, Third and Mixed Conditionals. </p>
<p> SECOND CONDITIONAL </p>
<p> I live in London so I travel every day on London buses. </p>
<p> I travel every day on London buses because I live in London. (note: this is the REAL present situation) </p>
<p> If I didn’t live in London, I would not travel every day on London buses. I would not travel every day on London buses if I did not live in London. </p>
<p> (note: this is the UNREAL present situation) </p>
<p> We use this Second Conditional structure to talk about unreal or very improbable situations in the present or future, in other words, for the hypothetical present or future. The structure is: </p>
<p> The mistake that I hear the most often with conditionals is this: </p>
<p> THIRD CONDITIONAL </p>
<p> I moved to London and I met him. (note: this is the REAL past situation) </p>
<p> If I had not moved to London, I would not have met him. I would not have met him if I had not moved to London. </p>
<p> (note: this is the UNREAL past situation) </p>
<p> We use this Third Conditional structure to talk about unreal situations in the past, in other words, for the hypothetical past. The structure is: </p>
<p> If I had been listening to the radio at that time, </p>
<p> Had I been listening to the radio at that time, </p>
<p> I would have heard the news. </p>
<p> One of the problems that English learners face with conditionals in conversation, both speaking and listening, is the way they are pronounced. Listen to these sentences for both second and third conditional again: </p>
<p> 1. If I won the lottery, I’d be rich. </p>
<p> 2. If I were you, I’d take the job. </p>
<p> 3. If they were serious about helping, they’d be trying to find a solution. </p>
<p> 4. If I hadn’t moved to London, I wouldn't have met him. </p>
<p> 5. If he’d crossed the road two minutes earlier, he’d have been hit by a bus. </p>
<p> 6. If I’d been listening to the radio at that time, I’d have heard the news. </p>
<p> As you can hear, we do not say WOULD clearly and we rarely say HAD clearly. We use quick, short pronunciation forms instead. So unless you practise and listen carefully, you might miss conditionals in conversation. If you can use these quick pronunciation forms (also called contractions) in conversation and in spoken English Exams, your English will sound much more natural. </p>
<p> Finally, let's look at MIXED CONDITIONALS </p>
<p> If I had not created the DailyStep English website, you would not be listening to this lesson. (note: this refers to how the unreal past affects the unreal present.) </p>
<p> So Mixed Conditionals are nothing new - they are just a mixture of Second and Third Conditionals. We use them to talk about unreal past and unreal present together. Take a look at these examples: </p>
<p> So, now you know these structures, there are a just a couple of rules to remember: </p>
<p> 1. If the main clause comes before the conditional clause, there is NO COMMA between the clauses. </p>
<p> So, now try to make some conditional sentences about your own life. Here are a few questions you could try to answer: </p>
<p> 1. What would you like to do if you could choose any job in the world? </p>
<p> 2. If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money? </p>
<p> 3. How would you have felt if you had met Nelson Mandela? 4. If you were on holiday, what would you be doing now? </p>

<p> English As A Second Language </p>
<p> 7 Steps to Learn English </p>
<p> We live in a world where learning English as a second language is essential. Not only for professional growth, but a second language brings possibilities to get to know a new culture. However, Learning English is much more than simply memorizing the translation of words into your language. This implies a total understanding of the language structure. The language is always rooted in the culture from which it comes. Therefore, you do not expect to be able to learn English without having adopted certain criteria and thoughts of the new culture in question. </p>
<p> Having the right information on how to start learning English as an ESL student is very important. There is a big difference between partially understanding the language and being fluent. If you want to acquire fluency but don’t know where to start, then this post is for you. We are going to present seven steps to start learning English. </p>
<p> Learning English is a goal that cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, you need to plan your learning strategy. No matter how lucky you are, no miracle will happen that allows you to handle a smooth conversation overnight. The path of learning requires strategy and preparation. A good tip to start is to make a space in your agenda to schedule your goals. It is good to prepare a list of everything you expect to learn in a certain period of time. Although you may not meet all the objectives, having your purpose clear at each stage allows you to progress steadily. </p>
<p> To start the whole process, you need to think about how you will learn the language. You will need to research and find out which method can help you acquire fluency in English. At this point, it is important to consider your ability to discipline and your daily commitment to the study. Also, it is important to find a material to guide you made by specialists and language scholars, </p>
<p> It is important to make a commitment to yourself and reserve a daily schedule to study and maintain daily contact with the language. For example, you can set aside about 30 minutes to study English. During this period of study, stay fully focused on what you are doing. Find a quiet place that is free from external factors. Set up a study calendar and follow it according to your goals. </p>
<p> The study needs to be a habit, but it cannot take all your time to the point of tiring your mind. Thirty minutes a day is ideal in a daily routine, especially considering that it is a reasonable period for not compromising other daily tasks. In addition to being important to reserve this study time, you will not miss some idle moments throughout the day. Use them to think, read texts, and listen to songs in English. </p>
<p> To learn to speak, it is necessary to learn to listen. It is not enough to listen without understanding. Create a base in the language, make contact with English daily. Familiarize yourself with it. A good and fun way to start is by watching English movies and series that you already know. Knowing and enjoying the story, it is easier to watch it a second or third time with English subtitles, and then even without subtitles. The same goes for books and music. Listen to some music you already know and like and follow along with the lyrics. You will see that it will be easier to understand. </p>
<p> The important thing is to be immersed in English and contact with the language exists in every way: speaking, listening, writing, and reading. Try taking the English language for small day-to-day tasks, such as social media or your smartphone. </p>
<p> Now, it is important to know how the learning process actually happens. Studying is not just sitting in front of a book and reading it from beginning to end. The act involves discipline and some more effective techniques. Go through the learning process slowly. Do it with fun, so you don’t get bored easily. Below are some of the techniques to help you quickly learn English. </p>
<p> Pronunciation </p>
<p> This should be the first phase of learning. Pronunciation is the saying of a word in English correctly. English is used in several countries, so the accent used is not always the same. But the most commonly used are American English and British English. </p>
<p> So, why do you have to learn the pronunciation first? This is because you need to be trained to pronounce correctly in the early stages of learning English. The correct pronunciation will also depend on practice. That is why you will need to practice daily. </p>
<p> If you are wrong in its pronunciation, it will even lead to misunderstanding. Therefore, it is essential for you to start learning correctly from the beginning. A good pronunciation helps you not only to speak well, but also to understand those who already speak the language. Besides, it will also give you the confidence necessary when the time comes to talk with a native. </p>
<p> Vocabulary </p>
<p> Learning vocabulary is a must if you want to be able to speak English. You can’t make a sentence if you are confused. Access a list of words and take your time to learn them every day. However, this does not mean you memorize a large number of terms as you will forget them easily. You can write these vocabularies down in a word document, a notebook, or any other system that can help you memorize them easily. </p>
<p> Learning vocabulary is very important when learning English. If you have a little vocabulary with you, you will encounter many difficulties. It could even be that you will easily give up learning English if you learn grammar, but your vocabulary is only a little. Memorize vocabulary continuously, every day. It doesn’t need much, as long as you have to memorize at least one vocabulary one day. Also, don’t forget to practice the correct pronunciation. </p>
<p> Spelling </p>
<p> Spelling has a relationship with the pronunciation of the correct English vocabulary. So, practicing correct spelling and pronunciation is already a package with learning vocabulary. When you memorize vocabulary, make sure the spelling in each vocabulary is correct. For example, the word “book.” You should know this word is spelled or formed from the letters “b-o-o-k.” By knowing the spelling of each word, you can avoid using the wrong word when writing in English. </p>
<p> In English, there are also several words in the same pronunciation but different spelling. In other terms, it is often called ‘homophones‘ (similar sounds of words). Learn to differentiate them so that you don’t get confused. </p>
<p> Grammar </p>
<p> When you start with your learning process, remember that every aspect of the language is very important, and grammar may be the most essential. This does not mean that you should learn the rules as if you were a linguist, but understand how the main tenses are structured (past, present, and future in all its variations). Regardless of the method you choose to learn English, it is a good idea to try to learn at least ten new words every week. After a while, your vocabulary will be wide. </p>
<p> Anyone who has learned English and wants to give you some advice will not find better words to refer to than telling you to watch English shows, movies, series, programs, etc. Watching programs and listening to conversations in English is an option that will develop your learning to new levels. In this way, you will have a real-time interaction with the language. In some cases, you will see the type of behavior and expression of the language used in everyday situations. </p>
<p> The best thing about this is that it gives you the tools and level of English of any native person while enjoying your favorite movies and stories. Your success will be determined by your consistency in learning until your English skills experience rapid progress. </p>
<p> The simple desire to learn a new language and the personal goals of can already be quite a motivation. However, there are other factors, such as finding an interaction group where you can meet and talk in English. This will make you practice the language even more and learn during conversations and exchanges of experiences. </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> Remember that learning English requires more effort. You will never finish learning a language. Even in your native language, there are words and expressions you don’t know. Keep in mind that you can’t learn everything, or forget everything. When you forget something, do not get frustrated or do tantrums with yourself. Just go back and check your notes, and you will be back in the game. </p>
<p> Finally, and most importantly, remember that no one was brought into the world with full knowledge of things. Learning English requires time, effort, and energy. But with practice, desire to learn, and dedication, you will find yourself enjoying watching movies and having conversations in English without struggling. </p>

<p> Learning English can be done in a huge variety of ways, from listening to native speakers and immersing yourself in day to day conversations all the way through to written exercises. We have a wide range of useful information and learning material designed to help you get to grips with the language and gain a much better understanding of it. It is for this reason that our editors have put together a selection of what they deem to be some of the very best learning English articles that you will find. </p>
<p> By taking the time to read through these articles and soak up the information presented to you, you will be sure to find that learning English soon becomes much easier. These articles are designed to explain ideas and tips in an easy to understand manner that is easy to digest. If our editors have suggested them, we believe them to be ideal. </p>
<p> English is renowned for having some seriously complicated grammar rules and it can be overwhelming trying to master every single one. It is important to take things step by step and focus on one grammar rule at a time, read up on it, practise it and then practise some more. This is the best way to be able to memorise and understand all the grammar rules that you will need to become a fluent speaker of the English language. </p>
<p> Grammar is simply the structure of the language and every language in the world has a grammar system. There are many points to consider within grammar such as syntax, phonetics and semantics, all of which sound extremely confusing. But once you have a handle on things, these will all seem much more easy to understand. </p>
<p> We have an excellent range of articles specifically designed in an easy to understand format which will assist you in learning all the grammar skills that you will need on your English learning journey. Choose one which interests you and go with it, then you can begin including your new found skills in your English conversations. </p>
<p> It is really important to remember that you cannot successfully learn a language without having a good knowledge of the grammar. It is one thing to learn common phrases and repeat these, and this will get you so far but if you want a much deeper understanding of the language then learning the grammar is an absolute must. </p>
<p> Learning English vocabulary is the basis of your journey to becoming a fluent speaker of the English language. When learning your native language, you begin building up a vocabulary at an early age and this develops over time, until you come to a point where to are fully coherent in the language. The same applies when learning English, you will begin with a basic vocabulary and over time, learn new words and phrases to add into your vocabulary in order to get to a more fluent speaking ability. </p>
<p> There are hundreds of thousands of words within the English language and it may seem like somewhat of a daunting task to remember them all and create your new English vocabulary. But it can be much more simple than it first appears. There are common phrases and words which are used every day in English conversations and there are more complicated words and phrases which may not used as often, all of these make up the vocabulary of the speaker. </p>
<p> Use these pages and articles to develop a greater English vocabulary and take the time to focus on the words and phrases that you feel are the most important and are going to be the most beneficial to your learning experience. On top of this, you need to consider what words and phrases you feel that you are going to need first and this will help you prioritise your vocabulary as well. </p>
<p> Many people pick up a language by reading lines and lines of text but if you are one of the many people who struggle to learn this way then there is an alternative. By using visual vocabulary, you are able to pick up an understanding of the target language, in this case, English, through the use of images alongside the required vocabulary. </p>
<p> By looking at a picture, the brain can more easily absorb the information been given and it has been proven that information is easier to remember when shown in a visual format. Learning a language can be overwhelming but by linking an image to the vocabulary that it represents, you are much more likely to recall the information quickly, which is essential when learning a language due to having to have a reasonable response time in a conversation. </p>
<p> If you think that you would benefit more from visual learning then this is definitely the place for you. Browse through some of the images here and use them to broaden your English vocabulary and get well on your way to becoming much more fluent. </p>
<p> In the English language there are literally hundreds of thousands of words, this may seem like a lot and you would be right in thinking so because compared to other languages, English has more words than any other. With Russian coming in at second place and having 20,000 less words than English. So you have your work cut out for you. That being said, English words tend to fall into certain categories and this can make learning them so much more simple. </p>
<p> Depending on what you are trying to say, will highly depend on which type of word you need to use. There are many different word types such as adjectives, nouns, verbs, adverbs, pronouns, conjunctions and so forth. Again this may seem like a daunting task to learn all of the various types but once you establish which words fall into which category, your English learning will excel to a whole new level. </p>
<p> Not only will learning English words help you in becoming much more fluent and natural sounding when using the language but on top of this, it is essential to be aware of English words and their types in order to be able to form a sentence. </p>
<p> The structure of a sentence is made up from various different types of words and understanding this structure will assist you in being able to form a sentence more easily and choose the correct English words. </p>
<p> It is not advisable to pick up an English dictionary, start at the beginning and learn words from A to Z as this will not be beneficial in becoming fluent. Learning the different word classes and what they are used for is the best way to learn as well as helping you to get to grips with English grammar. </p>
<p> In the English language there are many informal conversations that you will hear which feature slang terms. For native speakers these come as second nature and they often do not even realise that they are using a slang term. Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could get to the point in English speaking where you felt this way too? There is a way that this can be done and that is by taking the time to look at various English slang terms. </p>
<p> In short, a slang term is a word or phrase which is used in a colloquial sense, usually during an informal conversation, There are a variety of forms of English slang, some of which are used in a mild comedic way, for example the use of the phrase ‘get some dough’ which is slang for earning money right the way through to the use of obscenities. </p>
<p> Whilst obscenities, more commonly known as swear words are used in slang, it is important to note that these phrases should never be used in a formal situation such as during a transaction at a shop of within the workplace. </p>
<p> Slang is used to make a conversation lighter and less intense but it can also make making a point much more simple and quick. Many people will use slang terms in order to more easily express a feeling or an emotion which is more relateable, for example saying ‘I am knackered’ which means ‘I am tired’ can have a much bigger impact. </p>
<p> Whatever the reason for using slang, there is no denying that it features heavily within English and is something that should be focused on during the learning of the language. </p>
<p> There is more than one way to say a lot of things and that is where the synonym comes in. Often times, when listening to the English language, you will notice that someone may refer to something using a different word or phrase. This is called using a synonym. A good example of this would be the word beautiful, which can also be expressed by saying the words stunning, pretty, eye-catching or a whole host of other words. </p>
<p> A synonym is a word of phrase which means exactly the same as another word or phrase. One resource which is often used to come up with synonyms is a thesaurus. However, it is a really good idea to commit as many synonyms as you can to memory. </p>
<p> The reason for learning synonyms is so that you have a broader vocabulary and can avoid repeating the same word over and over again during any one conversation. Not only this, but being able to use synonyms will aid you in sounding more like a natural speaker. </p>
<p> An abbreviation is essentially a shortened version of a word or of a phrase, usually in a written context but in some cases in a verbal context as well. They are used in order to avoid having to continually write out longer words or phrases and can also be used to save time. In some cases abbreviations are used as a way to avoid having many longer words within a text, or in some cases within speech and can be implemented as a way to abide by modern standards. For example, the abbreviation LOL, is used as modern slang. It is not uncommon to hear abbreviations used in modern spoken language such as the term YOLO, which people will say during a conversation. </p>
<p> There is no set pattern to what an abbreviation should look like and in some cases, the individual author may even make up their own. You are unlikely to see a pattern but, with that being said, there are many common abbreviations which are standard within the English language. </p>
<p> Depending on the abbreviation, you might see a word in a shortened way, for example the word rehab is often used as an abbreviation of the word rehabilitation, this is common place and widely understood. However, in some cases, the abbreviation may come in the form of letters, which is also known as an acronym. An example of this might be YMCA, this is an abbreviation of the widely recognised charity the Young Men’s Christian Association, although it is rare that anyone ever refers to it by its full name as the abbreviation is standard. </p>
<p> English is said to be one of the hardest languages to learn, due to the many irregular grammar rules and in a lot of cases, the commonly confused words. The reason for this is that the English language has a tendency to use the same sounds, with slightly different spellings and meanings that could not be further apart. </p>
<p> It is not uncommon, even for native speakers to get words and their spellings mixed up and often times on English speaking social media posts you will see a comment correcting the spelling of the original poster. </p>
<p> In some cases, there are only two spellings to get confused between, but in some cases there are as many as three in words such as they’re which can also be spelt their and there and the three are often jumbled and misunderstood. It is important, as you begin to get a grip on the language to be able to differentiate between the different spellings and words in order to correctly express what you wish to say. Committing these commonly confused words to memory from the start and learning their uses and meanings is an excellent way to ensure that you always have a handle on them. </p>
<p> When looking at commonly confused words, you will often come across the term ‘homophones’ which is the descriptive word to describe the topic. </p>
<p> Within the English language there are currently thought to be over 170 thousand words in use, this is a lot to learn and so in some cases it is better to put down the dictionary and concentrate on some of the most common phrases that are used within the language. Whilst this is not going to make you fluent, it is an excellent place to start because it will give you the basis of everything else you will need to learn. On top of this, if you have a good understanding of the most commonly used phrases, you will be able to get by much more easily in most day to day situations. </p>
<p> If you are only planning to learn a small amount of the English language, perhaps you are staying in an English speaking country for a short period of time or you may have the need to perform some basic communication via email, for example, then common phrases are a great way to get that basic knowledge that you require. </p>
<p> As well as the above mentioned points, knowing the key phrases will enable you to begin speaking the language much more quickly than if you attempt to learn individual words. The reason behind this is that attempting to structure sentences yourself by means of stringing words together can often prove to be very tricky whereas using common phrases as a starting point can give you a good idea of how the grammar works within the language and enable you to build on these phrases. You will also be able to understand much more easily, what is being said to you during a conversation as many native speakers will use common phrases if they are aware that you are not completely fluent in the language. </p>
<p> Idioms are used massively during both spoken and written examples of the English language and you would be hard pressed (that’s an idiom) to spend even a few hours in an English speaking country and not hear at least one example of an idiom. </p>
<p> But what are they? In simple terms, an idiom is a figure of speech which is not meant to be taken in a literal sense. That being said, in their original use, one may often find that the idiom began by having a literal meaning, for example the term spill the beans is an idiom for announcing a secret, but its original meaning referred to the use of beans being put into a cup to cast a vote. If the cup was knocked over, the beans would spill out and reveal who had won. </p>
<p> Due to the non literal meaning of the English idiom, it is important to put an emphasis on learning some of the most frequently used ones. This way, not only will you be better able to understand when you hear someone use an idiom in conversation, but you will also be able to include them in your own speech. What better way to make yourself sound as if you are a native speaker? </p>
<p> A collocation is essentially a group of words which are usually found together, and this is something that you see often within the English language so it is important to learn which words are grouped together in normal speech. Collocations will sound familiar to a native speaker and are often used in conversation as well as in a written context. </p>
<p> The reason that is is so important is because by using the correct collocations, your English will sound much more fluid and natural. There are many examples of collocations, one such example being heavy rain. This is a collocation which is used very frequently in the English language to describe weather where there is a lot of rain. Other ways you might say this phrase could be large rain or strong rain but this would not sound correct, despite being perfectly grammatically correct. </p>
<p> There are various ways in which you can learn the most regularly sued collocations in English, one of which is to commit them to memory by reading through our series of articles here. Once you have a good ground knowledge of these collocations, you can then begin to integrate them into your conversations. </p>
<p> It may seem like collocations are a small detail when it comes to speaking English, but in fact they are much more important than they first appear and by using them you are more likely to sound like a native speaker, which is the goal when learning any language. </p>
<p> You are aware of verbs, which are ‘doing words.’ But there are verbs which feature more than just one word, these are known as phrasal verbs and are made up with two or more words. This type of verb is quite common in the English language and there are a huge variety of this type of verb such as ‘go into’ or ‘give out’ and it is very important that you are aware of how these verbs work. </p>
<p> The most simple explanation of a phrasal verb is that it is a phrase that describes the action rather than a word that describes the action. They are made up from a verb and a preposition or an adverb. In some cases, you will find phrasal verbs which feature three words, an example of this might be ‘look forward to.’ </p>
<p> As part of learning the English language, it is important to take note of the phrasal verbs, how the are conjugated and how they fit into day to day spoken and written language. </p>
<p> There are many phrasal verbs which have a literal meaning, but just to confuse things a little more, there are some phrasal verbs which make up an idiom, or a non literal phrase. A good example of this would be the phrasal verb to ‘put up.’ This can refer to giving someone somewhere to stay. When learning English, these phrasal verbs can be an excellent way to incorporate some idiomatic language into your speech and really impress the natives with your knowledge of their language. </p>
<p> English is a language which uses many letters that do not appear to be needed within a word. For example the word ‘tough.’ This is a word that, when seen by a non native speaker, could be pronounced in huge variety of ways, when in fact is it simply pronounced ‘tuf.’ Compare this to the word ‘dough’ you might think that you have the pattern sorted out and would pronounce this word ‘duf’ but you would be wrong. These two words do not rhyme, despite having a similar spelling. Is your mind blown? </p>
<p> If the answer to the above question is yes, there is no need to worry, you would not be alone. It is difficult, at times even for native English speakers to be able to know how to pronounce certain words, especially with all of those pesky unnecessary letters. But don’t let this put you off, one you have learnt about how to pronounce certain sounds within the language, it will become second nature to you. </p>
<p> This is why is it super important to make sure that learn the correct pronunciation of different English sounds right from the beginning of your learning. This will not only enable you to better understand the language but will also help you when reading from a text, especially if you are reading aloud. </p>
<p> Because there are so many different ways to pronounce certain letter combinations, it is a good idea to learn commonly mispronounced words individually and commit these to memory. </p>
<p> Another thing that is is important to remember is to learn the different sounds that each letter can make, for example the letter A might sound one way in the word ‘bag’ but sound different in the word ‘garble.’ </p>
<p> Forming sentences in English is one thing but without the use of punctuation, these sentences become jumbled and often times, meaningless. This is why it is super important to get a handle on how punctuation is used within the language. </p>
<p> Punctuation is simply a series of marks which determine pauses and beats within the structure of a sentence. Using them can be the difference between your sentence meaning one thing or another. One of the most common examples of how this can happen is the sentence ‘Let’s eat, Grandpa.’ When used with a comma, this sentence tells Grandpa that it is time to eat, however when you take the comma away, the sentence then says ‘Let’s eat Grandpa’ which tells us that the speaker is inviting everyone to eat Grandpa, literally. This shows us how important the correct use of punctuation can be. </p>
<p> You will find these detailed articles an excellent way to hone your punctuation skills and this will add to your ability to sound more like a native speaker in both verbal and written conversations. </p>
<p> When you are learning the English language, it is one thing to understand spoken conversation but it is also vital that you include the reading of some written language in your studies. The reason for this is that there are some things which feature in written English that do not feature in spoken English. One of these things is known as a literary device. </p>
<p> A literary device is a technique used by an author which can make the reading more understandable from a variety of perspectives. Using one of these structures makes the reader more easily able to understand and relate to what the writer is trying to convey and they are used very commonly in many examples of written English. This is not limited to stories, literary devices can be seen in use in texts such as scripts, song and essays too. </p>
<p> Some common types of literary devices are similes and metaphors which are used to make comparisons between things and create a bigger picture. Another common type would be alliteration which is used to add rhythm to a piece of text. However, there are many more literary devices and it is important to gain a good understanding of these. By reading articles on the subject, you are sure to be able to pick any literary device out of a piece of text. </p>
<p> Whilst English is spoken in both the United States Of America and in the United Kingdom, there are some greatly differing aspects to the language, depending on the geographical location that you are in. If you are speaking with an American and use British English, you will still be understood, as the two versions of the language are extremely similar and a native speaker of one will definitely understand a native speaker of the other. However, there are some slight differences in terms of local slang and what certain things are referred to as. </p>
<p> A great example would be that in American English the device used to transport people from floor to floor is referred to as an elevator, whereas in British English, it would be called a lift. A British English speaker would perfectly understand what you meant if you used the word elevator, but it would not be something that you would hear used very often when in England. </p>
<p> There are a huge variety of words which differ between the two versions of the language and another example are slang words. In America, some of the words which are used in British English, that may be quite offensive, would be quite acceptable to use within day to day conversation. An example being the word pissed, in America this word is frequently used on day time television, however in the United Kingdom, the word is seen as offensive. </p>
<p> Another point to take note of is that in America, the spelling of some words in the English language is different to the spelling in the United Kingdom, and often times these differences are very subtle. For example, the letters re are often rearranged at the end of a word, in America you would write ‘center’ whereas in the UK, it would be centre. The letters S and Z are also often changed in words such as Criticise (UK) and Criticize (USA.) </p>
<p> There are other variations on the English language in various countries where it is spoken, most commonly, Australia, where there are more similarities to British English but also many of their own words and phrases. </p>

<p> A complete lesson plan to teach the second conditional </p>
<p> I used the classic example "What would you take to a desert island?" to introduce the second conditional (or Type 2 conditional as some would call it). I wrote the question on the board (What would you take with you if you were trapped on a desert island?) and gave out this worksheet. Looking at the photo in the worksheet, learners are supposed to write items that they would possibly take to a desert island. </p>
<p> I was worried that they wouldn't understand the question because this was the first time they had ever seen the second conditional. However, they focused on thinking about items to take to the island, and not on the grammatical structure, which made everything easier. :) </p>
<p> I asked them to work in pairs and gave them a few minutes to complete the task. When the time was up, I wrote "If I were trapped on a desert island, I would take __________." on the board as an example for the students. Then, I asked the question to some of them, and they were able to answer it without any difficulty. After doing this dialogue with 5-6 students, I asked some concept check questions to convey the meaning. I used the following questions: (You have these on the second page of the worksheet I shared above.) </p>
<p> Are we talking about the past, present or future? (Future or present) </p>
<p> Is this a real or imagined situation? (Imagined) You can also specify this and ask: Am I trapped on a desert island? (No) </p>
<p> How probable is the if-clause? (Improbable) </p>
<p> I told them that these sentences are conditionals and we call this type of sentences the second conditional. Then I wrote on the board: </p>
<p> We use the second conditional to talk about u________ or i_______ things. (unreal or impossible) </p>
<p> It didn't occur to me in the lesson, but it might also be a good idea to introduce the word hypothetical at this point. </p>
<p> After making sure that the concept was clear, I asked a few questions to help them discover the rule: </p>
<p> What tense do you see in the if-clause? (past simple) </p>
<p> What tense do you see in the the main clause? (would + (bare) infinitive) </p>
<p> Remember to point out that "were" is the grammatically correct form of "to be" with all the subjects although "was" is also used in informal contexts. </p>
<p> Also point out that although we use the simple past, we're talking about present situations. </p>
<p> When you think they are ready to do some practice, you can start with this worksheet. It helps learners to practice the structure. After that, use this to focus more on meaning. </p>
<p> Finally, you can do this activity in which learners answer some interesting questions using the second conditional. I printed out each sentence on a different sheet of paper and put them up on the walls. The students walked around the class and wrote their answers, then we read them together and made some comments/asked follow-up questions. If you have the time, you can also have a look at this worksheet which includes mixed exercises for the first and second conditional. </p>

<p> Session 4 </p>
<p> Wouldn’t we all like to get away from it all if we had the chance? Where would you go on your dream holiday? In this session you’ll hear some of the BBC Learning English team talking about where they would go. Then you’ll have a chance to talk about your own dream destinations! </p>
<p> Sessions in this unit </p>
<p> Session 4 score </p>
<p> Activity 2 </p>
<p> Where would you go if...? </p>
<p> Over to you! </p>
<p> You've heard a bit about some of our dream holidays, but what about you? If time and money were not important, where would you go and why? What would you do on your dream trip? Read the grammar summary below and send us in your ideas! </p>
<p> Complete the activity </p>
<p> Remember that we use the second conditional to talk about hypothetical or unlikely situations. A dream holiday would usually be about somewhere you've never been before. We make the second conditional with two parts: </p>
<p> The hypothetical or unlikely part is introduced by if and is in the past simple </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. </p>
<p> The second part (what you'd do) comes after and is made with would + infinitive </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. </p>
<p> But remember that it can also be expressed the other way around (and the comma isn't needed here) </p>
<p> I would travel all around the world if I had lots of money. </p>
<p> We can also contract the subject and the verb would in these sentences </p>
<p> I'd travel all around the world if I had lots of money. </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I'd travel all around the world. </p>
<p> And finally, remember that there aren't two woulds! </p>
<p> If I would have lots of money, I would travel all around the world. (This is WRONG!) </p>
<p> To do </p>
<p> So, please write about your dream holidays. </p>
<p> Thank you for emailing your comments to us. We enjoyed reading them. This task is now closed. </p>
<p> Here are a few of the comments that we received. </p>
<p> Dmitriy, Russia </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I'd like to go to Oceania with my wife and our friends. In my opinion, that area is one of the most beautiful places in the world. It consists of many small islands placed in the Pacific Ocean. I'd like to vizit Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Hawaii. Those places are very good for scuba diving, serfing, boating and so on. Besides, there are many gorgeous beaches with white sand and clear blue water. It's really nice to spend a couple of evenings on a wild beach lying in a hammock and watching waves and beautiful sunset. I hope, one day my dream will come true. </p>
<p> Bruno, Brazil </p>
<p> Hello again BBC Learning English Staff, I am Bruno from Brazil and I'm starting a new life in Canada. </p>
<p> Canada is a wide and beautiful country and if I had time, I'd go for a road trip through all the provinces. I would love to see all the majestic lakes around Canada and I would be amazed if I had the opportunity to watch the aurora borealis. I read that you can see spectacular northern lights from the Northwest Territories. </p>
<p> Shaikh </p>
<p> Well, as far as my dream holiday is concerned I am a bit adventurous person, and if had chance to go to my dream place, I would definitely go to African forest. </p>
<p> African forests have very distinct ecosystem comparatively other part of the world places. It has all kind of animal out there, and has a vast sort of trees. </p>
<p> Yes for sure. If I had a huge amount of finance I would surely visit African jungle. </p>
<p> Gian Piero, Italy </p>
<p> If I were younger and rich, I'd like to travel all around the world to see all the wonderful sites I read, admired and studied on geography school books when I was in my teens. I still remember each photograph and every caption of the most amazing places in all the continents of the Earth. Oceans and great mountains, large lakes and long rivers, towns and peoples. Often I thought to myself: "When I'll be adult, if I have some time and enough money, I'll go everywhere". And curiosity isn't just of children. </p>
<p> Megan, Jiangxi Province, China </p>
<p> If I got the New Zealand WHV this year, I would really like to go to New Zealand! </p>
<p> Emiliano, Italy </p>
<p> If I had the possibility, I would go where the human being haven't already done something. </p>
<p> I would go where the Nature is still 'the hostess'. Of course many people could have the same idea, so this such of thing is an impossibility... (And we saw the possible damage that we can do). </p>
<p> Effectively my dream holiday still remain in the land of the dreams: if I were a writer, I would be in these kind of pleaces most part of the day... And maybe I'm already doing! </p>
<p> Marilia </p>
<p> If I didn't have family, I would travel around the world working as a volunteer. </p>
<p> Cristina Albiach, Spain </p>
<p> If money and time were not important, I would like to go to New Zealand, because I love unspoiled and wilderness places. If I was in New Zealand, I would hike through the mountains every morning to breathe pure air and enjoy the breathtaking landscapes. Furthermore, I would see strange species If I walked carefully. To be honest, I think that if I had the opportunity to dive with sharks, I wouldn't do it because I'm extremely scared. If I had the chance, I would try to meet New Zealand citizens to ask them about their culture and taste their traditional food. Finally at night I would sleep under the stars if it weren't dangerous. </p>
<p> Bogoreh </p>
<p> If I could go any where in the world, I would really like to go to the deep water sea, to get the breathtaking views in beneath the water, and the reason I'd really like to go there is, cause I would go swimming, scuba diving and see a lot of creatures in the beneath the water sea, because it's one of my favourite dream holydays which always shakes my mind of immaginery destinations. </p>
<p> Teo </p>
<p> I would love to go one of the island of thailand, "phi phi" island... </p>
<p> I saw the pictures, it's amazing, with its landscape and rocks in the sea... </p>
<p> The reason why I prefer to go to the phi phi island is simple, I love sun, hot sand swimming, a lots of people around and getting sunbathe on the beach. I think the island is one of the place where you can feel that you are alive... </p>
<p> Chu, from Taiwan </p>
<p> I was always thinking to do something for residents in Fukushima where was suffered tsunami and nuclear leaking accident 2 years ago in Japan. However, there were some obstacles which prevented me from my dream trip, such as money and language. So if I didn’t need to concern my affordable money and time, I would hire a professional translator and then travel there straightaway. </p>
<p> If I had a lot of money and time, I would donate my efforts on clean the contaminated land, pay reasonable salary to hire local survived inhabitants for recreate the environment, design eco-tourism package for redevelop part of local economy, etc. There were so many things I can do for them. If I got lots of money and time, I was happy to start my dream journey. </p>
<p> Xiao Zhong, China </p>
<p> I am a football fan. If I had lots of money and time, I would come into UK and see some great football matches, such as ones of Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. In this way, it is possible to see lots of well known super stars in the world, support my favourite teams directly and feel the dream atmosphere in the football kingdom. And I'd like to buy some souvenirs around the football field for my friends. </p>
<p> Geneviève </p>
<p> If i was free and had the money, I would go to Burma where my daugther in law is from and I would like discovering her country and her family. </p>
<p> Leyla </p>
<p> If a had time and money I would go with all my family on a trip around the world. I would start in Peru to visit Machupichu, then I would go to Brazil and take the sun in Rio de Janeiro. I´d continue to Europe, to visit there France and Italy, and I would finish in north of Africa. </p>
<p> Jurate, Lithuania </p>
<p> Hi, What would my dream holiday be like? If I had enough time, determination, endurance and a strong adventurous vibe I'd travel by bike along the Mediterranean coastline. I'd start my journey in Greece and I'd finish it in Portugal, by the Atlantic Ocean. It would be wonderful to go through all the European southern countries with no hurry, following my own guidelines, interacting with local people, getting to know better their lifestyle, visiting historical and cultural sites on the way and enjoying the famous Mediterranean food! I'd sleep in the tent under the open sky or in hostels in case of bad weather, I'd stop to swim in the beaches and I'd write my travel diary with pictures drawn by hand. I imagine this travel would be quite a challenge and I'd reach my destination tired, dirty and with no money, but if I accomplished it, I'd be very proud of myself. </p>
<p> Vicky </p>
<p> If money did not matter, I would spend two or more years travelling from one side of the planet to the other, whith no plans, no direction at all, and no worries. First of all , I would go to EEUU, Hawai islands exactly; to swim into the blue water sea, sunbath on the white sand and do trekking onthe high and green mountains. I would love to learn some words in their language, taste the tipical food, and let my body moves with the well-known Hula dancing. </p>
<p> Secondly, I would want fly to New York and stay there a few months if possible, cause I find awsome how many different nationality-people live there, together. That would inspire me a lot for getting to know how I really want my future to be. </p>
<p> To sum up, I would do all that so as to learn more about cultures around the Earth, but definitely not as a way to relax, but a way to live unique experiences I won't have if I stay at home; because I can't stand going somewhere and waste the time without visiting anymore than the hotel enclosure. </p>
<p> Natalia, Spain </p>
<p> If I had lots of money I would travel all around the world. I would like to visit diferents countries in Asia, Africa and South America and learn about their culture. I love travelling by train because you can enjoy the beautiful landscape and meet a lot of people who could help me in my trip. I would like to go to Peru and visit Machu Picchu, people say that is very hard to arrive on the top but at the same time is a beautiful experience. </p>
<p> Jose </p>
<p> Well, unfortunately at this moment I'm unemployed so I can't think on holidays but I can dream with them, so if I had enough money and time, I would like to go on holidays to Hawaii, I like its environment, its way of life, its lovely becahes, its volcanoes, and I can't forget the link between that marvellous land and Elvis Presley. I wish I could find a job in Hawaii, I'm sure that my family and me would be happy living and working in Hawaii. </p>
<p> Suzy, France </p>
<p> If my grandsons were older (they are actually 3 and 6 years old) , I would visit England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland with them and their parents. They are french but they live in Staffordshire and I come to visit them during a week or two. </p>
<p> If one day we went in Scotland, it would be nice to see amazing landscapes and gorgeous castles or in Wales or Ireland... it would be very nice! </p>
<p> Sandra, USA </p>
<p> If I had more time and money, believe it or not, I'd like to go to UK for a 6 months holiday, walking in the beautiful national parks you've got, like the Lake District or Dartmoor. If I could go on holidays to UK for 6 months, I would like to go with my family, traveling around and trying to improve our english skills, that would be fantastic. </p>
<p> If I had more time, I would spend more time walking in forests and hills, discovering news landscapes in different countries. If I had more time, I would like to walk from Greece to Norway but it would last so long that I would really need a lot of money. And if this could be possible, I would like to learn the language of the country I am walking in. </p>
<p> If it was possible, I would like teachers to come and walk with me, and trying to teach me how to speak their language. That would definitely be wonderful. If people could learn more languages, the world wouldn't have so many problems. If we could all be walking from time to time in a different countries, we could learn a lot about cultural and social diversities, and so be more tolerant. </p>
<p> Tarask </p>
<p> I'd like to go to UK and visit London in particular. I'd like to meet the BBC Learning English team. I'm a football fan so I'd visit some British stadiums and even might attend a match of the English Premier League. Also if I was in Britain I would go to Edinburgh and visit sightseeing of this city. </p>
<p> Ewa </p>
<p> If I had enough courage, I'd travel through the endless steppes of Mongolia. I'd take trans siberian train if I bought a ticket. If somebody went with me we would ride the mongolian horses. </p>
<p> I know that is blue-sky thinking but well, I love it. </p>
<p> Martin, Argentina </p>
<p> If I had lots of money and time, I'd invite all my family to travel around Europe. I'd take them to the castles of England we'd visit the littles villages of France trying the fantastic food they prepared and we'd go around the coast of Spain, Portugal and Italy. Hopefully I could do it one day. </p>
<p> Dang, Vietnam </p>
<p> I had never gone anywhere. My family were very poor, and my parents hadn't enough money for relaxing. Now, I’m an engineer and I can travel. I want to go to jungle in Amazon. There are many interesting animals that I have seen on Discovery Channel. Also I would go to the sea in Philippines in summer. I would walk by the sea side and swim at night. </p>
<p> Giuseppe, Italy </p>
<p> I'd like to spend a some of time together my wife and my sons in a tropical island such as the Maldives, Seychelles or Polynesia. I'd like swimming and to eat fish every day, I love the sea and the sunsets... no work, no problems, no smartphone, no internet, no cars, no traffic and no busy life... out of the world, only relax and romantic moments with my wife. </p>
<p> Trang, Vietnam </p>
<p> Hi! My name is Trang and I am from Viet Nam. Today I'd like to talk something about my ideal holiday trip. Actually, I think a dream holiday just needs to have 1 thing: Travel-mates. A travel mate could be your lover, your close friend or your class mate- whoever they are, whoever you travel with, as long as you feel comfortable besides. </p>
<p> And then, of course, you need some money to go along with lol. It depends on how far or how expensive the place you want to go is. If I have a choice, I would love to go to the beach ( in Viet Nam and also in other countries). Watching sunset, Walking along the seashore on your foot, waving, sunbathing, building castle in the sand, etc..that is just perfect for an amazing trip !!!!! </p>
<p> Anyway, my biggest favourite is taking photos of me and my beloved so in fact, I could enjoy travelling even in Ha Noi as long as I got my camera along with me. </p>
<p> Jianeng, China </p>
<p> If I had lot of money and time, I would love to go to Hawaii with my girlfriend. We both love the beach, I think we'll have fantastic time in there. </p>
<p> Sheila </p>
<p> First I need and want to tell you I'm a dreamer. And my dream is travel around the world and know all the culture as I can. I want to know the wheather, the food, clothes, languages and know the city by me. Not by the newspaper or television. I want to feel, I want to breathe the place. </p>
<p> I began my travel per Canada. I choose that after see some pictures and read a little bit about the country and thought that’s is awesome. The city is cold, clean, people must be polite and must be safe. I don’t know about their food, but I hope it is good. </p>
<p> Afterwards I will to Ireland, Greek … actually I can say I have a dream but I don't have enough money and time yet. So If I had lots of money, I would be jetsetter, for sure! </p>
<p> Tran Minh </p>
<p> If time and money were not important, I would travel all around the world. I really like travel. I want to go everywhere in the Earth. </p>
<p> If I had a dream holiday, I would travel tropical island first. I really like scuba diving to see marine life: dolphins, sharks, turtles,... </p>
<p> Second, I will go Africa. I want to see animals living in natural environment. I want to sleep outside where I can look sky with full of star. </p>
<p> Maybe one day, my dream holiday is come true. In order to my dream holiday is come true soon, I will try to get a lot of money! </p>
<p> Francois, France </p>
<p> I think I have the same dreams that many people: If I were richer than I am, I'd like to travel around the world. I have already been in several countries but if I had more money, I could stay longer than I ever stayed. I could better know how people live and what their culture is or at least discover it. I never won the lottery so I can't say :'if I won, I could do this or that thing'. Would I have more chance to win if I gambled more often? I don't know. I'll tell you if I do. I haven't any other dreams. If I had, maybe it would be better for me! </p>
<p> Nazaret </p>
<p> If time and money weren´t important, I´d travel to Germany and I´d only bring a bag with my stuff. I´d like to be a backpacker if I could. </p>
<p> Katerina, Russia </p>
<p> If I had a lot of money and a lot of time, I would go to Holland or Portugal. I would walk along the old streets. </p>
<p> I love the old city which was built on water. </p>
<p> And then I would go to Norway and Kenya. I would climb to the volcanoes and high mountains with the Sherpas. </p>
<p> If we talk about family vacation, I would go with Tim in Vietnam. We would swim in the ocean, admiring the fish. I would definitely see red sand and floating islands. </p>
<p> We would eat exotic fruits and study words in Vietnamese. I'd try to see the national dance show while traveling there. </p>
<p> Javier, Bolivia </p>
<p> If I had lots of money and didn't have to work, I'd do two things, first I'd travel all around the world with my mom, especially to the greatest historical humanity places, such as Egypt, Greece and Italy. And second I'd travel to places where there are concerts of my favorite rock bands, in order to hear all my favorite songs, indeed this second is one of my life goals, some day I hope to do it. And finally I would waste my time painting and creating art if I didn't have responsibilities. </p>
<p> Ana Paula, Brazil </p>
<p> I'm Brazilian. I'd like to travel and know my own country from North to South because we have so beautiful beaches here, charming places, good people, summer in a good part of the the year. But I have to confess that I love London. I went there last year, more exactly in B'mouth. So It would be a great dream holiday come back there again and learn more about that place. </p>
<p> Manoel Gomes, Brazil </p>
<p> If I had chance, I would go to Paris, the city of lights. When I was younger, I always thought what does Paris looks like. My father wanted me to study in Sorbonne. But I couldn't go to study there. One day, who knows, If I got a lot of money, I would walk around in Paris. </p>
<p> Tanker In </p>
<p> What would be my dream holiday? Well, I would like to go to visit other states in Myanmar. Since I'm curious to learn more about the culture of other ethnic groups in Myanmar, I would like to go to the states in Southern Myanmar, which is quite close to Malaysia. After that I would explore more states in the west, then I will head to the northern states which is quite close to China. Lastly, I would head to the easten states next to Thailand. If time and money were not important, I would visit all the countries in Asia, starting from Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, India, China, South Korea and lastly Japan. Then I would head north towards Mongolia and Russia. I would then visit western countries in this order, Poland, Germany, Norway, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and Lastly Portugal. I would then go to America, in this order, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. </p>
<p> If I had one billion dollars, rich enough to buy a fast boat, I would visit islands like Palmerston, Marshall Islands and so on... In all the countries I would visit, I would like to understand more about their culture, history, religion and note them down in my notebook. Since I am a person who likes Tanks, in Germany , Poland, United Kingdom and France, I would visit at least 2 war museums and learn more about WW2 History. In all the islands I would visit, I would like to enjoy the breathtaking views there and appreciate their beauty. </p>
<p> Isaack, Brazil </p>
<p> My dream holiday would go to Mars if it was colonized and held the basic conditions to support life, I would love walk in that wonderful red landscapes. It can happen, but it won't happen in a nearby future. So, I would like to be a rover to explore the red planet if it was possible. </p>
<p> Denis, Ukraine </p>
<p> If I known English well I would go to well-known scientist centres for exploration of coal in Poland, France and England. Working and living there I can study culture of native people at home and at work. Constant communication with other people is helped to learn English more quickly. I hope it will be very soon. </p>
<p> Silvano, Brazil </p>
<p> If I have a lots of money and time, I'd travel to Germany and UK because this my dream holiday. I hope one day before my death my dream will come true. I think these country is very interesting for them history. </p>
<p> Fabio, São Paulo, Brazil </p>
<p> My dream holiday if money, time and others responsibilities weren't a </p>
<p> problem, would be traveling for Machu picchu in Peru, to walk away in a Inca's trail. I would spend a </p>
<p> month just walking through the way sleeping under the stars and appreciating the breathtaking views in one of the most exciting places in the world. </p>
<p> Next </p>
<p> So you've now had a go at making second conditionals yourself! We hope you've enjoyed practising your language. Now, here's a question: would you travel in a car if it had no driver? Some people would! Find out more in News Report in the next activity. </p>
<p> Session Grammar </p>
<p> We use the second conditional in English to talk about unreal, imaginary or unlikely situations (like going on a dream holiday) </p>
<p> It's made up of two parts: </p>
<p> The hypothetical or unlikely part is introduced by if and is in the past simple </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. </p>
<p> The second part (what you'd do) comes after and is made with would + infinitive </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. </p>
<p> It can also be expressed the other way around (and the comma isn't needed here) </p>
<p> I would travel all around the world if I had lots of money. </p>
<p> There are not two woulds in a second conditional sentence </p>
<p> If I would have lots of money, I would travel all around the world. (This is WRONG!) </p>

<p> The second conditional </p>
<p> If you need more explanation about the second conditional, just give us six minutes of your time and we can help! Rob and Catherine are here to explain how to form it, how to use it and how to say it. </p>
<p> See if you can hear what small word many second conditional sentences begin with and also find out if Catherine is a football fan! </p>
<p> Rob Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob. </p>
<p> Catherine And me, Catherine. Hello. This programme is all about the second conditional. </p>
<p> Rob Yes the second conditional. We’ll see how to form it… </p>
<p> Catherine We’ll look at why and when we use it… </p>
<p> Rob There’ll be a very helpful pronunciation tip… </p>
<p> Catherine And there’ll be a second conditional quiz at the end of the show, so listen carefully! </p>
<p> Rob Let’s start by looking at why and when we use the second conditional. The main use of the second conditional is to talk about impossible, unlikely or imaginary situations. And here’s an example to do with football. Catherine, are you a football fan? </p>
<p> Catherine Err… I like to watch the big games, the internationals, the England games in particular – I do like an England game. </p>
<p> Rob Yes, they haven’t won for a long time… </p>
<p> Catherine Not since ’66, I think… </p>
<p> Rob ’66 was a long time ago, but maybe they’ll win one day… </p>
<p> Catherine Maybe! </p>
<p> Rob But at the moment it’s just a dream; not a strong possibility. So Mike’s here: let’s have a second conditional sentence about that situation Mike: </p>
<p> Mike If England won the World Cup, Catherine would be so happy. </p>
<p> Rob If England won the World Cup, Catherine would be so happy. Catherine, is that true? </p>
<p> Catherine It is, actually, I’d be very happy. Unlikely, but, I’d be happy. So: this is a second conditional sentence and it is made of two parts. The first part starts with the word if, plus a subject and a past simple verb, and it describes an unlikely or imaginary situation, like this: </p>
<p> Mike If England won the World Cup… </p>
<p> Catherine Thanks Mike. And the second part of the sentence has the word would or the negative woudn’t with an infinitive verb. It describes a possible result of the unlikely or imaginary situation. </p>
<p> Mike …Catherine would be so happy. </p>
<p> Rob That’s the result of the imaginary situation. And yes, If England won the World Cup, we would be very happy, wouldn’t we, Catherine? </p>
<p> Catherine We would! </p>
<p> Rob Good. Now, we can change the order of the two parts, and the meaning stays the same: </p>
<p> Mike We’d be so happy if England won the World Cup. </p>
<p> Catherine Right, thanks Mike. Let’s have some more examples. </p>
<p> Mike If Sunny had more money, he’d get a better phone. </p>
<p> I wouldn’t see you very often if I lived in the city. </p>
<p> Maria would have a better job if she spoke more English. </p>
<p> If I were you, I’d take a holiday. </p>
<p> Rob Thanks: lots of examples there. And the last one is particularly interesting: If I were you, I’d take a holiday. And of course this isn’t a real situation, because I can’t be you, can I? </p>
<p> Catherine You can’t be anybody Rob, except yourself, just you: we’re stuck with you. </p>
<p> Rob You’re stuck with me, yes: I’m afraid so. Anyway, we say a second conditional sentence starting with the words If I were you when we want to give someone some advice. And here the advice is to go on holiday. </p>
<p> Catherine It’s interesting that a lot of native speakers say If I were you, not if I was you. </p>
<p> Rob And if I were you, I’d go somewhere nice and hot with palm trees and sandy beaches. Mmm. </p>
<p> IDENT 6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English. </p>
<p> Rob And we’re talking about second conditionals. </p>
<p> Catherine Now for a word about pronunciation. Contractions or short forms – are very common in second conditionals – but they can sometimes be difficult to hear. </p>
<p> Rob Yes, that’s a good point. In the last example, the two words I and would become I’d. I’d take a holiday. </p>
<p> Catherine So would is shortened to just a /d/ sound. Listen out for the short /d/ sound in this next example: </p>
<p> Mike If I knew the answer, I’d tell you. </p>
<p> Catherine Yes, the phrase I would tell becomes I’d tell. One more time please Mike: </p>
<p> Mike If I knew the answer, I’d tell you. </p>
<p> Rob Well, wherever you are, I hope you know the answers to the quiz. It’s coming up next! </p>
<p> Catherine Yes, it’s quiz time! Choose the correct word or phrase to fill each gap. Here’s the first one. If you [beep] some money on the street, what would you do? Is the missing word a) find b) found or c) would find? </p>
<p> Rob And the answer is b): If you found £50 on the street, what would you do? </p>
<p> Catherine Another one: If you forgot your wife’s birthday what [beep] she do? Is it a) does, b) will or c) would? </p>
<p> Rob So the answer is c): If you forgot your wife’s birthday what would she do? I wonder what she’d do… </p>
<p> Catherine And the last one: I wouldn’t eat that if I [beep] you. Is it a) am b) were or c) be? </p>
<p> Rob And its b): I wouldn’t eat that if I were you. Well done if you got all those right. </p>
<p> So we’ve been talking about the second conditional. It’s made of if plus the past simple tense, and would plus the infinitive. We use it to talk about imaginary situations and their results. </p>
<p> Catherine There’s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Grammar. </p>
<p> Both Bye. </p>
<p> Did you hear that many second conditional sentences begin with the word if - plus a subject and a past simple verb, and it describes an unlikely or imaginary situation. Oh yes, and Catherine isn't much of a football fan but she likes to watch the big games, the internationals, the England games in particular! </p>

<p> End of Session 2 </p>
<p> That's it for Session 2. By now you should have a better understanding of forming and using the second conditional. If you're still unsure, there is a chance to practise what you've learnt in Session 3. </p>
<p> Session Grammar </p>
<p> We use the second conditional in English to talk about unreal, imaginary or unlikely situations (like going on a dream holiday) </p>
<p> It's made up of two parts: </p>
<p> The hypothetical or unlikely part begins with if and is in the past simple </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. </p>
<p> The second part (the possible result of the imaginary situation) is made with would + infinitive </p>
<p> If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. </p>
<p> The two parts can be in any order. When the would part is first, you dont need a comma between the two parts </p>
<p> I would travel all around the world if I had lots of money. </p>
<p> There are not two woulds in a second conditional sentence </p>
<p> If I would have lots of money, I would travel all around the world. (WRONG) If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world. (RIGHT) </p>

<p> A Review of Conditional Sentences </p>
<p> Basics of Conditional Sentences </p>
<p> While conditional sentences come in many forms, shapes and sizes, there are really two common characteristics that unite them into this broad category known as the ‘conditionals’. </p>
<p> A conditional sentence (or at least the part that forms the conditional) has two clauses. </p>
<p> Conditional sentences are, as it states in the name, conditional, meaning that one clause is dependent on another in some way, shape or form. This is the ‘condition’ clause or the clause that holds the situation that needs to be fulfilled before the action or situation in the other clause becomes relevant. Here is an example: </p>
<p> If she goes home, I will go home too. </p>
<p> The first clause (‘if she goes home’) is the condition that needs to be met. The second clause (‘I will go home’) is the result that will occur if the condition is fulfilled (the eponymous ‘she’ going home). </p>
<p> 2. The clauses are joined by a conjunction that shows a relationship or dependency between the clauses </p>
<p> For those who are unfamiliar with the term, a conjunction is a word used to connect clauses or sentences together. The most well-known clause is ‘and’. Specifically with conditional clauses, conjunctions that show a relationship between the two clauses in the sentences is needed. This is usually fulfilled by the word ‘if’, but other conjunctions can also fill this function and change the clause relationship. Such words include: when, unless and while. </p>
<p> This review is going to cover five kinds of conditionals: zero, first, second, third and mixed. Some argue that there are only four kinds of conditionals and that ‘mixed’ conditionals should not be considered a separate type of conditional. I would disagree as a mixed conditional has a different function than the other four. If this sounds confusing, don’t worry. We will get to them soon =) </p>
<p> In total, there are four conditional aspects: simple conditional, perfect conditional, continuous conditional and perfect continuous conditional. If you haven’t notice, these follow the same pattern for aspects of other tenses (e.g. present). In fact, the conditional aspects follow the future aspects very closely. </p>
<p> Simple conditional </p>
<p> A simple conditional is the most common type of aspect in the conditional tense. The simple conditional is similar to the future simple, which is made up of ‘will’ plus the main verb in the bare infinitive. For the simple conditional, instead of using the verb ‘will’, the verb ‘would’ is used in its place. Therefore, the structure is: </p>
<p> would + main verb in bare infinitive </p>
<p> Example: I would go … </p>
<p> Perfect Conditional </p>
<p> The perfect conditional also has similarities to the future perfect. The future perfect uses the verb ‘will’ followed by the auxiliary (helping) verb ‘to have’ in the bare infinitive followed by the main verb in the past participle (which defines the perfect tense). The perfect conditional follows the same pattern but uses the verb ‘would’ in place of ‘will’. </p>
<p> would + have + main verb in past participle </p>
<p> Example: I would have gone… </p>
<p> Continuous Conditional </p>
<p> The continuous aspect is defined as using the verb ‘to be’ and the main verb in the present participle case (verb + ‘ing’). The continuous conditional includes the verb ‘would’ in the front, forming: </p>
<p> would + be (conjugated) + main verb in present participle </p>
<p> Example: I would be going… </p>
<p> Perfect Continuous Conditional </p>
<p> Just as with the previous aspects, this one also follows the perfect continuous aspects of other tenses: </p>
<p> would + have + be (past participle) + main verb in present participle </p>
<p> Example: I would have been going… </p>
<p> Let’s look at the first type of conditionals: </p>
<p> Zero Conditional </p>
<p> A zero conditional, also known as the zeroth (0th) conditional, is the simplest of all the conditional sentences. The zero conditional is used in English to refer to a situation that is happening now or always happens. This situation is also real and possible, meaning that if the condition is fulfilled, the result is highly likely. In practical terms, this means that the zero conditional is used very often for general truths, such as the following: </p>
<p> If you heat ice, it melts. </p>
<p> Ice melts if you heat it. </p>
<p> The clause in blue is the condition clause. Note that it starts with the conjunction ‘if’. The clause in red is the result. The meaning of this sentence states that if thermal energy is applied to frozen water, it turns into its liquid state. This is a condition-result combination that is extremely likely to happen. It is also a general truth; in other words, that the time of the condition is irrelevant and the result will always be the same. The ice could be heated up yesterday, today, tomorrow or in 50 years by me, you or anyone else in the world; the result is constant. </p>
<p> The zero conditional is considered to be one of the easiest conditional sentences to learn because of its structure, which is shown below and colour coded to match the previous example. There are two possibilities: </p>
<p> Conjunction* + present simple tense, present simple tense. Present simple tense + conjunction* + present simple tense. </p>
<p> * It is important to note that while the conjunction is usually ‘if’ in conditional sentences, it can be any conjunction that shows a causal relationship between the condition and the result. Possible conjunctions include: after, as a consequence of, as a result of, as long as, as soon as, assuming, because, before, but for, even if, if, if only, once, only if, on the condition that, provided, providing, since, therefore, unless, until, when, whenever, wherever, whether, yet. Note that some of these conjunctions can only be used in certain types of conditionals because of the relationship that they establish between the clauses. </p>
<p> First Conditional </p>
<p> A first conditional is used in English to refer to a possible condition and its probable result. This situation is real and possible. The basic structure is as follows: </p>
<p> Conjunction* + present simple tense, future simple tense. Future simple tense + conjunction* + present simple tense. </p>
<p> Example: If you build it, they will come. </p>
<p> As you can see, there are a few differences from the zeroth conditional. Firstly the first conditional uses the future simple tense to talk about the result rather than the present simple. This is because of how English talks about the future. When we use the present to talk about the future, we mean that it is extremely likely to happen (for example, we have planned something and it is happening soon, such as the following sentence: ‘I am going to the doctor tomorrow’). When we use the ‘will’ future, the outcome is less certain or farther in the future. For more about the different ways to talk about the future in English, click here. </p>
<p> Secondly the first conditional has a time relationship. We saw that the zeroth condition was used for general conditions, meaning that the outcome of the condition was always the same. For the first conditional, the situation occurs in the present and causes a subsequent (following) result/reaction that happens in a point past the current point of speaking. This could be in either the near future or the far future. </p>
<p> Thirdly the zeroth conditional will happen no matter what but the first conditional only states the most probable result. Just because it is probable does not mean it is guaranteed to happen. </p>
<p> Zeroth conditional: If you heat ice, it melts. </p>
<p> Examples which follow the laws of physics are the easiest to show the use of the zeroth conditional. If the condition is fulfilled (thermal energy is added to frozen water) then the result will happen no matter what (assuming it heats the ice above the melting point). </p>
<p> First conditional: If it rains tomorrow, I will bring an umbrella. </p>
<p> Here, there is a possibility that the condition of water falling from the sky will happen tomorrow. If this happens, then there is the possibility that I will take an umbrella with me when I leave the house. This action is NOT guaranteed and so the result may not occur, even if the condition is fulfilled. </p>
<p> Second Conditional </p>
<p> The second conditional is used to show a hypothetical (unreal) situation in the present and the probable result. Unlike the first conditional, this hypothetical situation is very unlikely to happen, which means that even though the result is probable if the situation occurred, it is still very unlikely. There are two basic structures for the second conditional, the most common of which is below: </p>
<p> Conjunction + past simple tense, simple conditional -OR- continuous conditional. Simple conditional -OR- continuous conditional + conjunction + past simple tense. </p>
<p> Example: If this thing happened , this would be the result. </p>
<p> Example: If I had tonnes of money, I would be going on holiday all the time. </p>
<p> There is one very important exception to this construction: if you are using the verb ‘to be’, it is conjugated following the subjective mood. While this sounds complex, it just means that the conjugation is always ‘were’ (e.g. I were, you were, he/she/it were, we were, they were. </p>
<p> Example: If I were you, I would go see her. </p>
<p> This leads us quite nicely into the second structure, which is not used as often today. The structure is as follows: </p>
<p> If*+ ‘were to’ + verb in bare infinitive, simple conditional -OR- continuous conditional. Simple conditional -OR- continuous conditional + if*+ ‘were to’ + verb in bare infinitive. </p>
<p> Example: If this thing were to happen, this would be the result. </p>
<p> Example: If I were to have tonnes of money, I would be going on holiday all the time. </p>
<p> There are a few additional restrictions to this form because it uses the English subjunctive mood. As a rule, this construction is only used with the conjunction ‘if’. Secondly, while this form does not generally have a difference in meaning from the first one, it is considered much more formal as it is much older than the more modern form (i.e. first construction). For those reasons, it is a dying form of the second conditional. In fact, in some English-speaking countries, you may rarely hear this construction although you may still see it in writing, especially for legal or governmental documents. </p>
<p> Third Conditional </p>
<p> The third conditional is used to show hypothetical (unreal) situations in the past and their probable result. Because this situation has already past, it is now impossible that the result will actually occur. But how can we show the past if we used the simple past in the second conditional? Remember that English can talk about events further in the past using the past perfect (had + past participle), which is what happens in the third conditional: </p>
<p> Conjunction + past perfect, perfect conditional (would have …) –OR-or perfect continuous conditional (would have been …-ing) </p>
<p> Perfect conditional (would have …) –OR-or perfect continuous conditional (would have been …-ing) + conjunction + past perfect </p>
<p> Example: If it had rained, you would have been soaked. </p>
<p> Example: If it had rained that much, I would have been rowing to work for the past few days. </p>
<p> Overview of 0th, 1st, 2nd and 3rd conditional </p>
<p> Before moving on to mixed conditionals, let’s look at the conditionals that we have covered so far by putting them on a timeline. </p>
<p> In this image, the condition (the part with the conjunction in the sentence) is marked in X, which is where the condition is fulfilled. The line that comes afterwards is the possible time in which the result may occur. The zeroth conditional is shown in red, the first conditional is shown in green, the second conditional is shown in blue and the third conditional is shown in orange. </p>
<p> As we can see here, the condition for the 0th conditional (red) can happen at any time and the result occurs (usually) immediately or in the near future. Because the 0th conditional is used to describe general situations, these conditions can occur in the past, the present and the future and the condition can also occur in those time frames. </p>
<p> For the first conditional (green), the condition can happen now or in the near future since the simple present is used. The result can occur very soon after the condition is fulfilled or even far into the future. For example, ‘If she moves to Japan next year, I shall save enough money to visit her in 20 years’. </p>
<p> The second conditional (green) starts in the present (now) and describes an unreal situation (one which would not happen) and the outcome. This would create a kind of parallel universe where this situation happened instead of what we know to be a reality, which is why the line is drawn away from the timeline axis. </p>
<p> The third conditional (orange) also follows the same pattern as the second conditional but the condition starts in the past, causing a shift in the when the result could occur. </p>
<p> Sometimes, the second and third conditionals can be confusing to keep straight. How do you know if something is a second or a third conditional just by looking at it? The big difference is this: </p>
<p> The second conditional uses ‘would’ but not ‘have’ as an auxiliary verb: </p>
<p> If I were you, I would review the topics outside of class as well. </p>
<p> If I were you, I would be skipping class at this very moment. </p>
<p> The third conditional has the verb ‘to have’ in both clauses: </p>
<p> If I had won the lottery, I would have travelled around the world. </p>
<p> If I had won the lottery, I would have been travelling around the world instead of teaching at Jena University. </p>
<p> If you would like even more practice, I have prepared the following table with the beginning of sentences. Complete the sentence using the correct conditional: </p>
<p> If I had to teach Spanish to a person who knew nothing about the language </p>
<p> If someone pays me a compliment </p>
<p> If I had been born in the 17th century </p>
<p> If I had lived in another country when I was in high school </p>
<p> If I was born 10 years earlier </p>
<p> If I could meet someone famous </p>
<p> If my best friend got into a lot of trouble. </p>
<p> Mixed Conditionals </p>
<p> As the name suggests, a mixed conditional sentence uses parts from the normal conditionals above. The most common types of mixed conditionals are mixes of the second and third conditional, but why is this so? Well, if you try to mix parts of the zeroth and first conditionals, you just create the other conditional as their structures are very similar. </p>
<p> But why would anyone want to mix the second and third conditionals? What would be the point? If you look back at the previous conditionals, you notice that there is a condition that happens and then a result happens afterwards. This makes sense; this is how time as well as cause and effect work. But what about if something in the future caused you to do something different in the present? Or what if something that is happening now or is true generally that caused you to do something different in the past? Or what if we just need to shift the time but it is not covered under conditionals 0 through 4? That is where mixed conditionals come in. </p>
<p> Some generic examples of the two most common types of mixed conditionals: </p>
<p> If this thing had happened, that thing would happen. (had happened = 3rd conditional condition, would happen = 2nd conditional result) If this happened, that thing would have happened. (happened = 2nd conditional condition, would have happened = 3rd conditional result) </p>
<p> This may sound counter-intuitive, so here are some examples which may help to clarify the point: </p>
<p> If I had studied, I would have my driving license. (had studied = 3rd, would have = 2nd) </p>
<p> If you had crashed the car, you might be in trouble. (had crashed = 3rd, might be = 2nd) </p>
<p> If we didn’t trust him, we would have sacked (US = fired) him months ago. (did = 2nd, would have sacked = 3rd) </p>
<p> If I wasn’t afraid of spiders, I would have picked it up. (wasn’t = 2nd, would have picked = 3rd) </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Uses of the Conditionals </p>
<p> 0: general truth if a condition is fulfilled (at the same time) – If you heat it, ice melts. </p>
<p> 1: a possible (real) condition and its probable result (at the same time or soon in the future) – If it rains, I will take an umbrella. </p>
<p> 2: a hypothetical condition and its probable result (at that same time/a consequence in the very near, hypothetical future) – If you went to bed earlier, you would not be so tired. </p>
<p> 3: an unreal past condition and its probable result (also in the past) – If it had rained, you would have gotten wet. </p>
<p> Mixed: Change of time (a condition in the past and result in the present, for example) – If I wasn’t in the middle of another meeting, I would have been happy to help you (unreal present and probable result in the past). I would be a millionaire now if I had taken that job (probable result in the present from unreal past). </p>
<p> Present simple conditional (would + verb) OR present continuous conditional (would be + verb-ing) </p>
<p> If I were to go, … </p>
<p> Present perfect conditional (would have + past participle) OR present perfect continuous conditional (would have been + verb-ing) </p>
<p> If I had gone to the store, </p>
<p> … I would have bought pretzels. </p>
<p> Other modal verbs </p>
<p> There is one additional note about conditionals before we finish. While the modal verb usually used is ‘would’, other modal verbs can be used, including might and could: </p>
<p> I could be a millionaire now if I had invested in ABC Plumbing. If I had learned to ski, I might be on the slopes right now. If you did crash the car, you should be in trouble. </p>

Conditionals
•

What are conditionals in English grammar? Sometimes we call them 'if clauses'. They
describe the result of something that might happen (in the present or future) or might have
happened but didn't (in the past) . They are made using different English verb tenses.

•
•

There are four kinds:
The Zero Conditional:
(if + present simple, ... present simple)
If you heat water to 100 degrees, it boils.

•

•

•

The First Conditional:
(if + present simple, ... will + infinitive)
If it rains tomorrow, we'll go to the cinema.
The Second Conditional:
(if + past simple, ... would + infinitive)
If I had a lot of money, I would travel around the world.
The Third Conditional
(if + past perfect, ... would + have + past participle)
If I had gone to bed early, I would have caught the train.
(Notice we can put 'if' at the beginning, or in the middle. It doesn't matter at all.)

(Notice we can put 'if' at the beginning, or in the middle. It doesn't matter at all.)

The Zero Conditional
We can make a zero conditional sentence with two present simple verbs (one in the 'if
clause' and one in the 'main clause'):
If + present simple, .... present simple.
This conditional is used when the result will always happen. So, if water reaches 100
degrees, it always boils. It's a fact. I'm talking in general, not about one particular
situation. The result of the 'if clause' is always the main clause.
The 'if' in this conditional can usually be replaced by 'when' without changing the
meaning.
For example: If water reaches 100 degrees, it boils. (It is always true, there can't be a
different result sometimes). If I eat peanuts, I am sick. (This is true only for me, maybe,
not for everyone, but it's still true that I'm sick every time I eat peanuts)
Here are some more examples:
•If people eat too much, they get fat.
•If you touch a fire, you get burned.
•People die if they don't eat.
•You get water if you mix hydrogen and oxygen.
•Snakes bite if they are scared
•If babies are hungry, they cry

The First Conditional
The first conditional has the present simple after 'if', then the future simple in the other clause:
if + present simple, ... will + infinitive
It's used to talk about things which might happen in the future. Of course, we can't know what will happen in
the future, but this describes possible things, which could easily come true.
•
•
•
•
•
•

If it rains, I won't go to the park.
If I study today, I'll go to the party tonight.
If I have enough money, I'll buy some new shoes.
She'll be late if the train is delayed.
She'll miss the bus if she doesn't leave soon.
If I see her, I'll tell her.

•

First vs. Zero Conditional:The first conditional describes a particular situation, whereas the zero
conditional describes what happens in general.
For example (zero conditional): if you sit in the sun, you get burned (here I'm talking about every time a
person sits in the sun - the burning is a natural consequence of the sitting)
But (first conditional): if you sit in the sun, you'll get burned (here I'm talking about what will happen
today, another day might be different)

<p> Do you Teach the Communicative Functions of the First Conditional? </p>
<p> The first conditional is used for more than just talking about future events. We need to explore common communicative functions of the first conditional such as making promises and negotiating. </p>
<p> What is the first conditional? </p>
<p> The first conditional (as it’s often called) is generally a sentence with two clauses: </p>
<p> an ‘if’ clause with the present tense (or verb 1) </p>
<p> a conditional clause with some reference to the future (will, might, may) </p>
<p> Here is an example commonly found in grammar reference books: </p>
<p> If it rains tomorrow, I’ll take my umbrella with me. </p>
<p> Why is it sometimes called a real conditional? </p>
<p> The first conditional is sometimes called a real conditional. It is real because the situation (context) is not an imaginary one (it might rain tomorrow) and the consequence (taking an umbrella) is a likely or possible action in the future. </p>
<p> Most descriptions of the first conditional focus on form </p>
<p> Before writing this post, I did a quick online search for explanations of the first conditional. Most explanations (for teachers and students) covered the form but didn’t really explore the functions. </p>
<p> As a side note, make sure your learners know that ‘to be going to’ is often used in the conditional form. </p>
<p> If you do that again, you’re going to have an accident. </p>
<p> What is the most commonly taught function of the first conditional? </p>
<p> Many explanations were vague. Here are some examples: </p>
<p> Talking about possible future events is a general communicative function. There are specific functions of the first conditional which we should explore. </p>
<p> Why don’t we explore the range of functions of the first conditional? </p>
<p> Some course books and grammar reference books mention specific functions but I’m not sure they are explored in any depth. </p>
<p> The first conditional isn’t particularly difficult for our learners. It’s easy enough to present, the structure is logical, and we can give them lots of transformation and gap-fill exercises to ensure they master the form. </p>
<p> I would argue that learners feel as if they have mastered the form but rarely get sufficient exposure and practice opportunities to perform the specific functions. </p>
<p> How often do we explore the range of functions associated with the first conditional? Our typical explanation (future possibilities related to real events) is rather vague and doesn’t really engage the learners. </p>
<p> The other functions are more difficult as concepts, but we can provide clear and memorable contexts to present the first conditional when used for these other communicative functions. </p>
<p> What are the specific functions of the first conditional? </p>
<p> There are many functions of the first conditional which are rarely explored by teachers. Let’s look at some examples: </p>
<p> If you eat these vegetables, you’ll grow up to be a big strong boy like your brother. </p>
<p> You’ll get sick again if you don’t take your medicine. </p>
<p> You’re going to get fired if I catch you smoking in the bathoom again. </p>
<p> If we don’t make a decision soon, we won’t have any options left. </p>
<p> You’ll be eating hospital food for a week if you speak to my wife like that again! </p>
<p> If we agree to a 5% increase in your salary, will you be willing to relocate to Manchester? </p>
<p> When we start thinking about the real function of these sentences, we can bring them to life. </p>
<p> If you eat these vegetables, you’ll grow up to be a big strong boy like your brother. </p>
<p> In this sentence, we can imagine a parent persuading their child to eat some vegetables. The parent is trying to influence the behaviour of the child. In other words, they are trying to persuade or convince. </p>
<p> Here are some common functions of the first conditional </p>
<p> If you eat these vegetables, you’ll grow up to be a strong boy like your brother. If you don’t buy this product now, you’ll regret it. Juts imagine. If you accept this job, you’ll be running the department within 6 months. </p>
<p> You’ll get sick again if you don’t take your medicine. </p>
<p> If you don’t pass the exam, you won’t go to university. If you walk home alone, something bad might happen. If you don’t pay attention to the road, you’ll have an accident. </p>
<p> If you do that again, I’ll report you to the police! I’ll leave you for good if you speak to me in that way again. If I catch you smoking in the bathroom again, you’re going to get fired! </p>
<p> If you eat those carrots, I’ll buy you an ice cream. I’ll take you to the concert if you pass your English exam. If you lend me £10, I’ll pay you back £20. </p>
<p> I’ll pick you up from the airport if your plane gets in late. </p>
<p> If you buy two packs, you’ll get a third pack for free. We’ll enter you in our competition for a holiday to New York if you write your email here. </p>
<p> Well, if we accept the offer, we’ll make $5000 in the next 6 months. But, if we wait until next year, the long-term benefits will be higher. Um, but if we don’t make a decision soon, they’ll take both options off the table. </p>
<p> So, if we agree to a 5% increase in your salary, will you be willing to relocate to Manchester? If I relocate to Manchester, will you pay for the relocation costs? How about this? If you agree to work in Manchester, we’ll pay for 60% of your relocation costs and put you and your family up in a 5-star hotel for the first month until you find somewhere to live. OK. I’ll agree to that as you long as you provide two season tickets to watch Manchester United for me and my son. </p>
<p> Activities to encourage our learners to explore the functions of the first conditional </p>
<p> In my experience, learners are far more engaged by exploring functions such as warning and negotiating than something as general as ‘future events’. </p>
<p> We often present the first conditional to A2 level learners and give them plenty of opportunities to practise the form. Then, we move on to more complex conditionals and rarely explore the more interesting and useful functions of the first conditional. </p>
<p> Warning: Encourage rather than insist that your learners use the first conditional in these freer practice activities. Other exponents (structures and phrases) are used to perform these functions and insisting on only one form leads to awkward and inauthentic discussions. </p>
<p> Here are some activities you could use to explore these functions </p>
<p> Persuading and Convincing </p>
<p> Selling Products: Students try to convince their peers to buy their products/services </p>
<p> Speed Dating: Students convince their peers to choose them as their date. </p>
<p> Holiday Planning: Students try to persuade their peers that their choice for a holiday destination is the best option. </p>
<p> Purchasing: Students try to persuade their peers that their preference for a new car/computer/mobile phone is the best option. </p>
<p> Survival Task: Students are stranded somewhere (desert. the moon, on a raft in the ocean) and have to persuade their peers to take action. </p>
<p> Warning </p>
<p> Negative Consequences: Students try to dissuade their peers from doing something by focusing on the possible consequences. If you get married to him, you’ll be expected to give up your job. If you leave your job to travel the world, you’ll never buy a house when you’re older. </p>
<p> Safety Guides: Students create a guide (travel, going to university, moving to another country) with a list of warnings. </p>
<p> Making threats and rules </p>
<p> Role plays: Students act out situations of conflict, such as meetings between students and teachers, parents and children, husband and wife, rival businesses, police officers and suspects. </p>
<p> Creating rules, regulations, and laws. Create a class contract for learners and teachers: We can only use our mobile phones in class if our teacher says we can. </p>
<p> Making Promises and Offers </p>
<p> Sales copy: Students discuss how to promote their products or businesses. They think of enticing promises and offers. </p>
<p> Radio / TV adverts: Students use this sales copy to create short radio or TV ads. </p>
<p> Study contracts: Students work with the teacher to create study contracts detailing what each part promises to do. For example: The teacher will show us a short film every Friday if we all do our homework. </p>
<p> Discussing Options and Consequences (Negotiating) </p>
<p> Syllabus Planning: Teachers and students discuss the syllabus and type of activities for their English classes. This is a really valuable activity as it encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning. They explore options using first conditionals. If we focus on speaking for the first 6 weeks, we can work on our writing in the second half of the course. </p>
<p> Business Negotiations: Great for Business English learners. Student A (or Group A) has a goal. Student B (or Group B) has a different goal. Both parties enter into a negotiation in order to achieve their goal. </p>
<p> As you can see, we can create a variety of authentic tasks related to the functions listed above. </p>
<p> These tasks can be used to give our learners the opportunity to practise first conditionals and related structures (provided that, in the case of, as long as etc.) </p>
<p> More importantly, they can acquire a deeper understanding of the specific communicative purposes of the structure. </p>
<p> Have I missed any common functions? Please let me know. </p>

<p> Gerard on October 8, 2019 at 5:55 pm </p>
<p> Good day Dylan I have found your article about first conditional for communication very interesting. I just have a question which I hope you or anyone else can help me with. </p>
<p> Can one make a complete lesson for making promises using the first conditional or is this a to specific (narrow context to use. Or am I completely confuse with regard to context (meaning) </p>
<p> Hi Gerard. Thanks for your question. I think an entire lesson on making promises using the 1st conditional would be too much. However, you could use the topic of ‘promises’ as the basis for the lesson and get your students talking about a) promises they have made b) the importnace of making & keeping promises c) collocations with promises d) strategies for ensuring you keep promises e) situations in which people make promises and so on. The grammar focus would only be one component of the lesson. </p>
<p> Hello. For some reason (my fault, not yours), I was sceptical when I clicked on this post via Facebook. I suppose I thought it was going to another ‘let me explain why you’re doing it all wrong’ sort of post. (I have a problem with these, and yet am drawn to them. That’s why I clicked.) </p>
<p> I was mistaken. I really like the tone you adopt. The ideas you suggest are rock solid. The points you make are spot on. I will definitely be sharing this with the teachers I supervise, and I’ll look forward to implementating this in my own teaching. </p>
<p> I don’t know you, Dylan Gates, but I hope I’ll be reading more of this kind of thing in the future. Thanks. </p>

<p> Conditionals: First, Second, and Third Conditional in English </p>
<p> Conditionals! Learn conditional definition with examples. There are four types of conditionals in the English language: first conditional, second conditional, third conditional and zero conditional. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> Conditional Definition </p>
<p> Conditionals are structures in English that establish what will happen if a certain event takes place or if a certain action is performed. This means that if a certain condition is true, a certain result occurs. </p>
<p> There are four types of commonly used conditionals in the English language that are differentiated on the basis of the degree of possibility implied by each of them. They are the first conditional, the second conditional, the third conditional and the zero conditional. </p>
<p> Types of Conditionals </p>
<p> First Conditional </p>
<p> This conditional is used to talk about future events that might happen. It uses the present tense to discuss the possible future events. For example: </p>
<p> If it rains, we will have to cancel the picnic. </p>
<p> If you come with me, I will make it worthwhile for you. </p>
<p> If I go abroad, I will get something back for you. </p>
<p> If you wait till 1 pm, you can go back with him. </p>
<p> If you visit Paris, you must see the Eiffel Tower. </p>
<p> Second Conditional </p>
<p> This conditional is used to talk about the unreal possibility or impossible events. They establish the course of action that would follow, where something to happen is either hypothetical or surreal. For example: </p>
<p> If I had a million dollars, I would buy a penthouse on Park Avenue. </p>
<p> I could stop working if I won the lottery. </p>
<p> If I were well-versed in the subject, I would help you with your assignment. </p>
<p> If I were you, I would ask her to marry me. </p>
<p> What would you do if it were to rain later? </p>
<p> Third Conditional </p>
<p> This conditional talks about the past, unlike the first and second which discusses events in the real or unreal future. These conditions, too, are therefore impossible, because they have either already occurred or might have occurred but won’t anymore. For example: </p>
<p> If I had studied a little more in college, life would have been easier. </p>
<p> If we had gotten to the airport on time, we would have caught our flight. </p>
<p> I could have asked him about the matter if he had shown up. </p>
<p> Sometimes the ‘if’ clause is merely implied, as in: </p>
<p> I would have done it. (…if you had asked me to) </p>
<p> I wouldn’t have allowed it. (…if it had been tried with me) </p>
<p> Zero Conditional </p>
<p> The zero conditional discusses an absolute certainty; the result of the condition is always true. The most common types of zero conditionals are scientific facts. For example: </p>
<p> If you cool water to zero degrees, it turns into ice. </p>
<p> Zero conditionals, therefore, do not deal with the future or the past; they simply deal with facts. The ‘if’ in these conditionals can be replaced with ‘when’: When you cool water to zero degrees, it turns into ice. </p>

<p> Conditionals </p>
<p> Sophie is in Iceland for work and Oliver is in a really bad mood. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> As you watch the video, look at the examples of conditional sentences. They are in red in the subtitles. Then read the conversation below to learn more. Finally, do the grammar exercises to check you understand, and can use, conditionals correctly. </p>
<p> We use conditional sentences to say one thing depends on another. They can be used to talk about real or imaginary situations. One of the clauses starts with if (or a similar word) – this is the conditional clause. The other clause talks about the result of the conditional clause happening. </p>
<p> Ummm? </p>
<p> Don’t worry, it’s a lot easier than it sounds. Let’s look at some examples. </p>
<p> If you don’t tell me, I’ll just keep asking. If I promise to travel less, will you forgive me? </p>
<p> I know that one. It’s a first conditional: if + present simple, then will + infinitive. </p>
<p> That’s right. It’s for talking about a situation in the future which the speaker thinks is quite possible. If the first condition happens, something will happen as a result. In this conditional sentence, the present tense after if refers to the future, not the present. </p>
<p> And can you change the order of the clauses round? </p>
<p> Yes, and we leave out the comma in the middle of the sentence if the order is changed round. </p>
<p> I’ll just keep asking if you don’t tell me. </p>
<p> OK. I also know the second conditional. If + past simple, then would + infinitive. </p>
<p> Right again! This is for talking about an unlikely or unreal condition. </p>
<p> If you travelled less because of me, I’d feel worse. If I had the opportunity to visit places like that, I wouldn’t complain! </p>
<p> So, in the second example, Oliver doesn’t think he will have the opportunity to travel a lot. It’s possible but improbable. We use the past simple to show that it’s not likely, not to indicate past time. </p>
<p> Can you use any other verbs, apart from would, in this kind of conditional? </p>
<p> Yes, we sometimes use other modal verbs like might or could in the result clause (not the if clause). </p>
<p> I see. What about, 'If you mix blue and yellow, you get green'. Is that a conditional? </p>
<p> Yes. That’s a zero conditional. We often use them for facts, or in academic subjects. </p>
<p> When it rains a lot, the animals move to higher ground. (geography) </p>
<p> What about other words that can replace if, like unless and as long as? </p>
<p> Well, unless is a kind of negative version of if. </p>
<p> I’ll never go unless you take me. (= If you don’t take me, I’ll never go.) </p>
<p> As long as imposes a condition on someone. You’re telling them what you expect them to do. </p>
<p> You can borrow my surfboard as long as you get it back to me by five o’clock. </p>
<p> So if you agree to what I say, you can borrow my surfboard? </p>
<p> Exactly. </p>
<p> Are there any other conditionals? </p>
<p> Well, there’s the third conditional, but we’ll deal with that separately. </p>
<p> Phew! Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll have to stop there. </p>

<p> Oliver: Hey, how’s Iceland? Sophie: I love it. Oliver: Oh, what a surprise! Sophie: It is actually. I don’t normally like camping! Oliver: If I had the opportunity to visit places like that, I wouldn’t complain! Sophie: What’s the matter with you today, Ollie? Oliver: Ah, nothing really. Sophie: If you don’t tell me, I’ll just keep asking ... Oliver: Hmm. Yesterday, you were so excited, you didn’t ask about my exam! Sophie: Oh, Ollie! I’m so sorry. You’re more important to me than camping and volcanoes! Oliver: Well, it doesn’t always feel like it. Sophie: If I promise to travel less, will you forgive me? Oliver: No. Because you won’t travel less. You love it. And if you travelled less because of me, I’d feel worse. So … it’s not an option. Sophie: You don’t make it easy! Seriously, honey, I don’t think I knew about the exam. If I’d known, I would have asked, you know that. Oliver: Well, anyway. Have you been near that volcano? What’s its name? Sophie: Even if I had three days of classes, I wouldn’t be able to say it, I don’t think. Wait, I can’t say it unless I read it – Eyjafjallajökull. There are about 30 active volcanoes in Iceland; the eruption in 2010 of Eyja … of that volcano really wasn’t so serious. If it hadn’t affected flights, we wouldn’t have heard much about it. There’s a bigger volcano near it – with a shorter name too – Katla. I’ve been to see that. The landscape here’s awesome ... You can’t imagine what it’s like. Oliver: No? Well, I’ll never go unless you take me. Sophie: Darling, please … Oliver: Sorry. What’s it like? Sophie: It’s beautiful. Water, rock, ice, lava, geysers … there aren’t many trees, obviously. I’ll send photos later. Oliver: Look, do you want to speak to Daisy? Sophie: Ollie, love? Oliver: I’ll be OK. Let’s talk tomorrow. Sophie: OK. Hi, Daisy. Daisy: Hi, Mum. </p>

<p> I would like to go to Japan, because I want to know more about this country and its customs </p>
<p> If I chose a part of the world to go to, I would travel to Amsterdam because of its cold weather, I would walk all day in its streets admiring its big buildings </p>
<p> it's something surprising since it helped my activity and thus identify how each side of the conditionals is like the verbs in the past </p>
<p> It is a very difficult question. because I want to visit many places, but I think if I could go anywhere during my vacation, I would go to Canada. </p>

<p> Conditionals 1 </p>
<p> Do you know how to use the zero, first and second conditionals? </p>
<p> Look at these examples to see how zero, first and second conditionals are used. </p>
<p> If you freeze water, it becomes solid. If it rains tomorrow, I'll take the car. If I lived closer to the cinema, I would go more often. </p>
<p> Grammar explanation </p>
<p> Conditionals describe the result of a certain condition. The if clause tells you the condition (If you study hard) and the main clause tells you the result (you will pass your exams). The order of the clauses does not change the meaning. </p>
<p> If you study hard, you will pass your exams. You will pass your exams if you study hard. </p>
<p> Conditional sentences are often divided into different types. </p>
<p> Zero conditional </p>
<p> We use the zero conditional to talk about things that are generally true, especially for laws and rules. </p>
<p> If I drink too much coffee, I can't sleep at night. Ice melts if you heat it. When the sun goes down, it gets dark. </p>
<p> The structure is: if/when + present simple >> present simple. </p>
<p> First conditional </p>
<p> We use the first conditional when we talk about future situations we believe are real or possible. </p>
<p> If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the beach. Arsenal will be top of the league if they win. When I finish work, I'll call you. </p>
<p> In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually: if/when + present simple >> will + infinitive. </p>
<p> It is also common to use this structure with unless, as long as, as soon as or in case instead of if. </p>
<p> I'll leave as soon as the babysitter arrives. I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job. I'll give you a key in case I'm not at home. You can go to the party, as long as you're back by midnight. </p>
<p> Second conditional </p>
<p> The second conditional is used to imagine present or future situations that are impossible or unlikely in reality. </p>
<p> If we had a garden, we could have a cat. If I won a lot of money, I'd buy a big house in the country. I wouldn't worry if I were you. </p>
<p> The structure is usually: if + past simple >> + would + infinitive. </p>
<p> When if is followed by the verb be, it is grammatically correct to say if I were, if he were, if she were and if it were. However, it is also common to hear these structures with was, especially in the he/she form. </p>
<p> If I were you, I wouldn't mention it. If she was prime minister, she would invest more money in schools. He would travel more if he was younger. </p>

<p> Why these sentences doesn't follow the usual structure of the first conditional? I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job. You can go to the party, as long as you're back by midnight. Thanks. </p>
<p> Lobna Tarek replied on 29 April, 2020 - 15:09 Egypt </p>
<p> So we can use other modal verbs than (will) for the first conditional and other modals than (would) for the second conditionals , right? </p>
<p> What about the sentence ( I don't want to stay in London as long as I don't get a well-paid job) ? This is a first conditional sentence and no modals are used. And in the sentence ( you can get a key if I'm not at home ) , is (can) used here instead of ( will ) to express specific ability in the future? Thanks and waiting for your response. </p>
<p> Not all conditional sentences contain modal verbs. So-called zero conditionals contain normal finite (present) verbs in each clause, for example. </p>
<p> I don't think your first example is a well-formed sentence. We would use either unless or if to form the sentence rather than as long as: </p>
<p> I don't want to stay in London unless I get a well-paid job. </p>
<p> I don't want to stay in London if I don't get a well-paid job. </p>
<p> The result clause here describes a present emotional state rather than a future action. You can contrast it with this: </p>
<p> I won't stay in London unless I get a well-paid job. </p>
<p> I won't stay in London if I don't get a well-paid job. </p>
<p> In your second example can probably describes specific ability in the future, though you could have a context in which it describes a general truth - something which is always possible because of the way the house or flat is organised, rather than being a particular situation on a particular day. </p>
<p> I want to know the difference between the use of first conditional and zero conditional in question sentences. Does it obey to the same rules as affirmative or negative sentence ? For example which of these sentences is correct : What happens if we arrive late at the cinema ? What will happen if we arrive late at the cinema ? </p>
<p> Both sentences are grammatically correct. Note that these are examples of subject questions in which the question word (what) is the subject of the verb. You could also make object questions: </p>
<p> What does the usher do if we arrive late at the cinema? </p>
<p> What will the usher do if we arrive late at the cinema? </p>
<p> 1. If you are going to market, bring me a pen. 2. If you go to market, bring me a pen. </p>
<p> If both are correct, what is the difference in meaning. </p>
<p> 2nd boubt: </p>
<p> My friend told me that, in Ist conditional, we can use any tense in condition/result clause as the requirement. </p>
<p> You don't need to print your tickets as long as you'll have the email. </p>
<p> I used first conditional structure. Plz help and clarify my doubt why the answer is 'you have the email' not you'll have the email. </p>
<p> As long as performs a similar function to if in this structure, and it is followed by a present form, just as in the if-clause of a first conditional. If you want to use a modal verb like will then it should be in the other clause: </p>
<p> You won't need to print your tickets as long as you have the email. </p>
<p> Thanks Peter M sir. I am glad that I got the response and it's cleared my doubt. My English is not so good but is site is very helpful. </p>

<p> Conditional Forms </p>
<p> In English there are four common conditional forms; zero, first, second and third conditionals. </p>
<p> Zero, First, Second and Third Conditionals </p>
<p> There are four common conditional forms; zero, first, second and third conditionals. The zero and first conditionals are sometimes called 'real' conditionals, whereas the second and third conditionals are often called 'unreal' conditionals. All four conditional forms are composed of two clauses; the conditional (if) clause and the result clause. When a conditional sentence starts with the conditional (if) clause, it is separated from the result clause by a comma. If the sentence begins with the result clause, it is not separated from the conditional (if) clause by a comma. </p>
<p> Zero Conditional </p>
<p> The zero conditional is used to talk about something that is generally true. It can be used, for example, to explain scientific facts. The Zero conditional explains that if (a) is true, then (b) is also true. The Zero conditional can refer to past or present facts. </p>
<p> Basic Construction: (If + subject + present simple verb), (subject + present simple verb.) = (Conditional clause) , (result clause.) Or (Subject + present simple verb) + (if + subject + present simple verb.) = (Result clause) (Conditional clause.) </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If it snows, I don't drive my car. </p>
<p> The journey to London takes 30 minutes if you use the motorway. </p>
<p> 'If' can often be replaced by 'When': </p>
<p> When it snows, I don't drive my car. </p>
<p> First Conditional </p>
<p> The first conditional is used to talk about the consequences of future events which are (at least in the opinion of the speaker) realistic, possible or likely. The 'if' clause describes the future event and the result clause explains the possible or probable consequence of the action. The First Conditional can only refer to future events (things which have not happened at the time of speaking). </p>
<p> Basic Construction: (If + subject + present simple verb) , (subject + will + verb.) Or (Subject + will + verb) + (if + subject + present simple verb.) </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If he fails the exam, I will be surprised. </p>
<p> If I win the lottery, I will buy a house in San Fransisco. </p>
<p> I will look for a new job if my boss doesn't give me a pay rise. </p>
<p> First Conditional and the Imperative When we talk about the future, we often give commands or instructions, using an imperative form (Stop talking!). We can use the first conditional form to give conditional instructions. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If you see Robert, tell him to come to my office. </p>
<p> If you smoke in here, remember to open the windows first! </p>
<p> Second Conditional </p>
<p> The second conditional is used to talk about the hypothetical consequences of future events which are, at least in the opinion of the speaker, unlikely, improbable, impossible or unrealistic. The 'if' clause describes the future event and the result clause explains the hypothetical consequences of the action. The Second Conditional can only refer to future events (things which have not happened at the time of speaking). </p>
<p> Basic Construction (If + subject + simple past verb) , (subject + would + verb.) Or (Subject + would + verb) + (if + subject + simple past verb.) </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If he failed the exam, I would be surprised. </p>
<p> If I won the lottery, I would buy a house in San Fransisco. </p>
<p> I would look for a new job if my boss didn't give me a pay rise. </p>
<p> Third Conditional </p>
<p> The third conditional is used to talk about things that would have happened if events in the past were different. The third conditional only refers to the past and only refers to ideas or actions that are hypothetical and impossible. It is often used to express regret about actions in the past that the speaker would like to change. The 'if' clause describes the past event which did not happen, and the result clause explains the hypothetical consequences of the action. </p>
<p> Basic Construction (If + subject + past perfect) , (subject + would + have + past participle) Or (Subject + would + have + past participle) + (if + subject + past perfect) </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If I had known he was married, I wouldn't have gone to dinner with him. (I didn't know, so I went to dinner with him.) </p>
<p> You would have met my brother if you had come to my party. (You didn't come to my party, so you didn't meet him.) </p>
<p> If I had studied harder at University, I could have been a Lawyer. (I didn't study hard, so I am not a Lawyer.) </p>
<p> Common alternative forms: </p>
<p> First Conditional 'If' can often be replaced by 'Unless' (to give the meaning "If...not) 'Will' can be replaced by another future form (Going to... or Present Perfect) 'Will' can be replaced by other modal verbs (depending on meaning) including 'Can, May, Might, Shall, Should, Ought to, Need to.' </p>
<p> Second Conditional 'If' can often be replaced by 'When' 'If' can often be replaced by 'Unless' (to give the meaning "If...not) 'Would' can be replaced by other modal verbs (depending on meaning) including 'Could, Should, Ought to.' </p>
<p> Third Conditional Typically, the third conditional does not change, though 'Could' can replace 'Would'. However, it is very common for the conditional clause of a Third Conditional to be added to the result clause of a Second Conditional, to form a "Mixed Conditional". In spoken English this is perfectly acceptable, provided the meaning of the sentence is not altered. </p>

<p> Conditionals </p>
<p> 1. English Conditionals Zero Conditional: Certainty The Zero conditional is used for things that are always true as long as the condition is met. IF Condition Result Situation present simple present simple If you heat water to 100 degrees celsius, it boils. fact- universal present simple present simple If I drink coffee, I get a headache. fact- personal English Conditionals: First Conditional First Conditional: A real possibility in the future A First Conditional sentence is one connecting two future actions, where one must take place before the second is possible. Take a student who wants to go to university but hasn't got the results of their exams yet. They cannot go to university until they have received their results. In the case of a good student who is expected to get good grades, then there is a good possibility of achieving the marks required to get to university, so the following sentence could be used: IF Condition Result present simple WILL + base verb If she gets good grades, she will go to university. We are talking about the future, but we use a present tense for the condition and will for the result. In this case, the person is sure about going to university. We can use other modal verbs in the result part of the sentence: IF Condition Result Possibility she gets good If she will go to university. If the condition is met, then she definitely will go grades, If he gets good grades, he may go to university. He is not sure about going to university. she gets good she should go to The speaker is expressing his or her opinion, giving If grades, university. advice. If he gets good grades, he can go to university. This means that it is possible. she gets good If she could go to university. This means that it is possible, but not that likely. grades, </p>
<p> 2. If he gets good grades, he might go to university. This means that it is possible, but not that likely. We can also use different present forms in the condition part of the sentence: IF Condition Reason for tense Result present simple an action in the future If I see her, I'll ask her about it. present progressive an unfinished present action If they are still working, I'll go home. present progressive a future arrangement If they are going, I'll stay at home. present perfect a finished action related to now you have finished your If I'll clear away the plates. meal, WILL + base verb making an agreement WILL + base verb I will let you have Friday If you will work late today, off. expressing displeasure because someone insists on WILL + base verb WILL + base verb doing something If you will drive too fast, the police will stop you. </p>
<p> 3. English Conditionals: Second Conditional Second Conditional: Imaginary Present or Unlikely Future The Second Conditional can be used used to talk about imaginary present situations, where we are imagining something different from what is really the case. We can also use it to talk about things in the future that are unlikely to happen, as the condition is unlikely to be met. We use the past tense in the condition part and would for the result. IF Condition Time Result Possibility past simple present WOULD + base verb impossible If I had the time, I would learn Italian. I don't have the time, so I'm not going to learn Italian. past simple future WOULD + base verb unlikely I won the I would travel around the There's a very small chance of winning the lottery, so If lottery world. the trip is unlikely We can use other modal verbs in the past tense in the result part of the sentence: IF Condition Result Certainty past simple WOULD + base verb I had the Although unlikely to happen, the speaker is sure that they would If I would learn Italian. time, do it given the opportunity. I had more If I might learn Spanish. Although unlikely to happen, it is only a possibility anyway. time, I had more I should learn some Although unlikely to happen, the speaker is saying that it would be If time, more about IT. a good idea, but is not committed to it. I had more If I could learn Hindi. Although unlikely to happen, it is only a possibility anyway. time With the verb to be, there are two forms that can be used with I, he, she & it: IF Condition Result I, he, she, it Were If I were you, I'd marry her. I, he, she, it Was </p>
<p> 4. If I was you, I'd marry her. English Conditionals: Third Conditional Third Conditional: Imaginary Past The third conditional is used when we are talking about the past and imagining something different from what actually happened: Condition Result What actually happened Past Perfect WOULD HAVE + Past Participle If I had known, I would have helped. I didn't know and didn't help. IF Condition Result Certainty WOULD HAVE+ past past perfect participle Although this didn't happen, the speaker is sure about If I had known, I would have helped. the result. Although this didn't happen, the result is only a If I had known, I could have helped. possibility. Although this didn't happen, the result is only a If I had known, I might have helped. possibility. Although this didn't happen, it is only a good suggestion If you had known, you should have helped. or piece of advice. </p>
<p> 5. Conditionals: Summary Here is a chart to help you to visualize the basic English conditionals. Do not take the 50% and 10% figures too literally. They are just to help you. probability conditional example time 100% zero conditional If you heat ice, it melts. any time 50% first conditional If it rains, I will stay at home. future 10% second conditional If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. future 0% third conditional If I had won the lottery, I would have bought a car. past Mixed conditionals In the mixed conditional sentences we can combine the second and third conditional. If he had left immediately, he would be here now. (He didn't leave immediately and isn't here.) If I had studied hard when I was young, I wouldn't be a porter now. (I didn't study and I am a porter.) If we hadn't told him the way while he was preparing for his journey, he would get lost now. (We told him and he isn't lost.) Inverted conditionals We can also make conditional sentences by changing the word order in the if clause. Had he booked the hotel room, he wouln't have slept at the camp. (If he had booked ... ) Were I in your position, I would accept it. (If I were ... ) This form is less common, quite formal and is mostly used in writing. Note If is the most frequent expression in the if clauses, but other expressions are also possible. even if, provided (that), unless, on condition (that), in case You will leave tonight even if you don't want to. </p>
<p> 6. You can have your birthday party provided that you aren't noisy. We'll sell you the ranch on condition you pay in cash. You should take a dictionary with you in case you forgot some words. Unless you do something, she won't come back. (If you don't do anything, ... ) </p>
<p> 7. Exercises Zero conditional Complete the zero conditional sentences with the verb in brackets.

<p> Conditional sentences </p>
<p> The most common kind of conditional sentence that you are likely to meet will contain two clauses, one of which will start with the word if, as in If it rains, we’ll have to stay at home. The clause without the if is the main clause of the sentence, while the if clause is subordinate. The order of the two clauses is generally not that important to the meaning of the sentence; so we can switch the ifclause to the end of the sentence if we want to. </p>
<p> Most grammar books tend to recognise four basic configurations of tenses in conditional sentences which vary in structure according to the time that we are talking about (past, present or future) and the meaning. These four types are normally referred to as the zero, first, second and third conditionals; we will look at the forms and meanings of each of these in turn and also examine some of the alternatives to these four basic types. </p>
<p> Zero-type conditionals </p>
<p> Form and meaning </p>
<p> The form of the zero conditional causes no problems since the present tenses are used in both clauses. </p>
<p> Zero-type conditionals </p>
<p> If clause </p>
<p> Main or conditional clause </p>
<p> If + Present tense </p>
<p> Present tense </p>
<p> If you heat water </p>
<p> it boils. </p>
<p> The zero conditional is normally used to talk about facts and to express general truths. </p>
<p> First-type conditionals </p>
<p> Form and meaning </p>
<p> The basic form for this type of conditional sentence can be seen in the chart below. As before, the order of the clauses can be changed with no change in meaning. </p>
<p> This type refers to future possibilities that are certain or probable. </p>
<p> First-type conditionals </p>
<p> If clause </p>
<p> Main or conditional clause </p>
<p> If they don’t arrive soon </p>
<p> If they are late </p>
<p> You will note that on the if side of the sentence any present tense can be used, while in the main clause the speaker is free to choose any future that helps to express any additional meaning that the speaker wants to express. </p>
<p> If he’s sleeping, he won’t wake up until morning. (The Present Continuous in the first part of the sentence expresses the present temporary nature of the situation and the will in the second part is making a prediction about the future.) </p>
<p> Alan is going to post me the recipe, if he finds it. (In the first clause I am expressing Alan’s intention so going to is the best future to use, while the second clause contains a Simple Present tense.) </p>
<p> If he’s staying at the party, I’m leaving. (In the first clause I am thinking about the possible current state of affairs, so I choose the Present Continuous, while in the second I am referring to the future plan that I have in mind should he decide to stay, so again I choose the Present Continuous.) </p>
<p> If you have finished the essay, leave it on my desk. (By using the Present Perfect tense in the ifclause I am stressing the completed nature of the action, while in the second clause I have used an imperative, which has a future meaning.) </p>
<p> Second-type conditionals </p>
<p> Form and meaning </p>
<p> This type is often called the hypothetical or ‘unreal’ future conditional since it is usually used to speculate about either very unlikely future situations or present and future impossibilities. </p>
<p> Second-type conditionals </p>
<p> If clause </p>
<p> Main or conditional clause </p>
<p> If I had wings </p>
<p> If you were coming with us, you would have a great time. (Either I am not expecting you to come or you have already told me that you do not intend to come, so the situation is very unlikely to happen.) </p>
<p> I’m sure my mother would help if you asked her. (I am unsure whether you are going to ask so I hedge my bets by using an ‘unreal’ conditional; if I had used I’m sure my mother will help instead, this gives the impression that I feel you are likely to ask.) </p>
<p> If I were you, I’d call back later. (This is a fixed expression used for giving advice, but since I can never be you, I use the future hypothetical conditional; you should note that many people would say if I was you and this is becoming increasingly common.) </p>
<p> Third-type conditionals </p>
<p> Form and meaning </p>
<p> This type refers to hypothetical situations in the past. In this case we use the Past Perfect tenses in the if clause and would + have in the main clause. </p>
<p> Third-type conditionals </p>
<p> If clause </p>
<p> Main or conditional clause </p>
<p> If I had known about his condition </p>
<p> If we had known about the storm </p>
<p> The main uses of the third conditional are for speculating about the past, expressing regrets, excusing our own actions and criticising others. Some of the uses tend to overlap in practice as the examples below demonstrate: </p>
<p> If we’d taken the first turning, we would have been at home by now. </p>
<p> If I’d bought the lottery ticket, we would have won millions. </p>
<p> If I’d realised you were going to be so sensitive, I’d have kept quiet. </p>
<p> The meeting would’ve finished before 1:00 if you’d said less. </p>
<p> There is one other major variation to the form given in the chart above; in place of the more usual </p>
<p> If I had known about his condition… </p>
<p> we can use </p>
<p> Had I known about his condition… where the if is omitted and the subject and auxiliary verb are inverted. </p>
<p> Mixed conditionals </p>
<p> The four types of conditional sentence discussed above appear to fit into very rigid patterns of form and meaning but we often find exceptions to these rules. In many cases we may want to talk about events that happened or did not happen in the past and the present results of those events. Therefore, we will often need to mix clauses from different conditional types in order to get our meaning across clearly and unambiguously. Taking one example from above, we might want to say: </p>
<p> If I’d bought the lottery ticket, we would be millionaires now. </p>
<p> In this sentence I want to refer to something that I did not do in the past (and probably regret) and the possible effect that this action might have had on the present – so I use a third-conditional ifclause and a second-conditional main clause. Swapping around these two types we also get: </p>
<p> If he was going to come, he would have arrived by now (with a second-conditional if clause and a third-conditional main). </p>
<p> This kind of mixing of conditional types is not uncommon. </p>

<p> Summary of English Grammar: Conditional Sentences and Mixed Conditionals </p>
<p> Approximate chronological order: </p>
<p> Elicitation: Zero Conditional </p>
<p> – We use the zero conditional to talk about things which are always or generally true, or things which always happen as a result of something else. – Example: If I’m late, my boss gets angry. </p>
<p> Elicitation: Second Conditional </p>
<p> – We use the second conditional to talk about present or future hypothetical situations and their present or future consequences. – Example: If I were rich, I’d buy a new car. </p>
<p> Elicitation: First Conditional </p>
<p> – We use the first conditional to talk about possible present or future situations and their future consequences. – Example: If my holiday request gets approved, I’ll go to Thailand. </p>
<p> Elicitation: Third Conditional </p>
<p> – We use the third conditional to talk about past hypothetical situations and their past consequences. – Example: If I had taken a taxi, I wouldn’t have missed my flight. </p>
<p> Elicitation: Mixed Third + Second Conditional </p>
<p> – If clause (third conditional about the past) + result clause (second conditional about the present or future) – We use this to talk about past hypothetical situations and their present or future consequences. – Example: If I hadn’t missed my plane, I wouldn’t be in this situation! </p>
<p> Elicitation: Mixed Second + Third Conditional </p>
<p> – If clause (second conditional about something which is always true) + result clause (third conditional about the past) – We use this to talk about hypothetical situations which are always true and their past consequences. – Example: If I weren’t so careless, I wouldn’t have lost my wallet. </p>
<p> Conditional Forms: All Conditionals </p>
<p> – If clause + result clause, or – Result clause + if clause </p>
<p> Form: Zero Conditional </p>
<p> – If + any present tense, + any present tense. – Most common form: If + present simple, + present simple. </p>
<p> Form: First Conditional </p>
<p> – If + any present tense, + any future tense. – Most common form: If + present simple, + future simple (will). </p>
<p> Form: Second Conditional </p>
<p> – If + past simple / past continuous, + present simple / present continuous (would). – Most common form: If + past simple, + present simple (would). </p>
<p> Form: Third Conditional </p>
<p> – If + past perfect / past continuous, + present perfect / present continuous (would). – Most common form: If + past perfect, + present perfect (would). </p>
<p> Form: Mixed Third and Second Conditional </p>
<p> – Third conditional (past) + second conditional (present / future). – If + past perfect / past continuous, + present simple / present continuous (would). </p>
<p> Form: Mixed Second and Third Conditional </p>
<p> – Second conditional (always true) + third conditional (past) – If + past simple / past continuous, + present perfect / present continuous (would) </p>
<p> Other Important Information: </p>
<p> – Using “unless” to replace “if”. – Using future time clauses to replace “if” in first and zero conditionals. – Using imperatives in the result clause. – Using modal verbs in either clause. </p>
<p> Imperatives and Modal Verbs in the Result Clause of First and Zero Conditionals: </p>
<p> – Elicitation from students. – Any first or zero conditional sentence with an imperative or a modal verb in the result clause is both a first and zero conditional sentence. – Example: If you go on holiday, don’t forget your wallet. (Imperative) – Example: If you go on holiday, you should remember to bring your wallet. (Modal verb) – Both these sentences are both first and zero conditionals. </p>
<p> Comparison of all conditional forms using the same sentence: </p>
<p> – Zero conditional: If I eat too much, I get sick. – First conditional: If I eat too much, I will get sick. – Second conditional: If I ate too much, I would get sick. – Third conditional: If I had eaten too much, I would have gotten sick. – Mixed third and second conditional: If I had eaten too much, I would be sick right now/later. – Mixed second and third conditional: If I always ate too much, I would have gotten sick a long time ago. </p>

<p> Transformation of Sentences Part 2-- CONDITIONAL SENTENCES </p>
<p> There are four basic types of conditional sentences in the English language. Each type has two parts - the main clause and the if clause. Zero conditional: I take my umbrella if it rains. First conditional: I'll call you if I work late. Second conditional: If the bus didn't arrive on time, I would drive you to the airport. Third conditional: She wouldn't have come if I hadn't invited her. Zero conditional The zero conditional describes situations that are always true. If has the same meaning as when or whenever. If I go to school, I get up at seven. (Whenever I go to school I get up at the same time.) If you park your car on double yellow lines, you pay a fine. (Whenever you park illegally, you pay a fine.) Form We use the present simple tense in both the main clause and the if clause. First conditional The first conditional refers to the present or future. First conditional sentences are used to speculate about possible situations that can really happen. If he studies hard, he'll pass the exams. If we catch the 10.15 train, we will arrive on time. If you don't get the ticket, what will you do? Form If clause: if + present tense Main clause: will + bare infinitive Second conditional The second conditional also refers to the present or future. In second conditional sentneces we speculate about situations that will probably never happen. If I had more time, I would help you. (But I am not free at the moment. I can't help you). If I won a million dollars, I would start a business of my own. (But I know that it is not realistic.) Form If clause: if + past tense Main clause: would + bare infinitive Note: the verb to be can have a specific form in the if clause. If I were rich, I wouldn't work. If he were younger, he would marry her. (But was is also possible: If I was rich, I wouldn't work. If he was younger, he would marry her.) But: If I were you, I wouldn't do it. (In this expression, were is much more usual than was.) The first conditional versus the second conditional The main difference between the first and second conditional is about probability: the first conditional is realistic, the second conditional is unrealistic. Sometimes we can use either the first or second conditional with the following difference in meaning. If I see him, I will tell him. (I suppose I will see him, because we go to the same school.) If I saw him, I would tell him. (I don't think I will see him, because he is ill.) If I need your help, I'll call you. (It is probable that I will need your help.) If I needed your help, I'd call you. (It is not very probable that I will need your help.) Sometimes we must use either the first or the second conditional, because it is clear that the situation is real or unreal. If you get up late, you will miss your bus. (a real situation) If I came from your country, I would understand your problems. (an unreal situation - I am not from your country.) Other forms Apart from the basic forms (if + the present simple + will and if + the past simple + would), we can use other verb forms in the first and second conditional sentences in the English language. Type 1 If you have finished your dinner, you can ask for the bill. If you are feeling tired, take a rest. If he is a good skier, he might make it. If you want to be slim, you should eat less. If you meet her, could you let me know? Type 2 If I knew his address, I might go and see him. If we were on holiday, we would be lying on a beach now. Why are we watching this film? If we were watching the news, it would be more interesting. Third conditional The third conditional sentences always refer to the past. We speculate about situations that happened or did not happen in the past. If I had won a million, I would have started a business of my own. (But I didn't win anything.) If he had met her, he would have told her. (Unfortunately, he didn't meet her.) If we hadn't practised, we wouldn't have won the match. (But we practised and won.) Form If clause: if + past perfect Main clause: would + perfect infinitive (have + past participle) Other forms Apart from the basic form of the third conditional sentences, we can use other verb forms in English. We didn't save any money. If we had saved some money, we might have bought the house. She wasn't there and I wasn't sitting next to her. But if she had been there, I would have been sitting next to her. I was looking at the trees when I fell off the bike. If I hadn't been looking at the trees, I wouldn' t have fallen off the bike. Mixed conditionals In the mixed conditional sentences we can combine the second and third conditional. If he had left immediately, he would be here now. (He didn't leave immediately and isn't here.) If I had studied hard when I was young, I wouldn't be a porter now. (I didn't study and I am a porter.) If we hadn't told him the way while he was preparing for his journey, he would get lost now. (We told him and he isn't lost.) Inverted conditionals We can also make conditional sentences by changing the word order in the if clause. Had he booked the hotel room, he wouln't have slept at the camp. (If he had booked ... ) Were I in your position, I would accept it. (If I were ... ) This form is less common, quite formal and is mostly used in writing. Note If is the most frequent expression in the if clauses, but other expressions are also possible. even if, provided (that), unless, on condition (that), in case You will leave tonight even if you don't want to. You can have your birthday party provided that you aren't noisy. We'll sell you the ranch on condition you pay in cash. You should take a dictionary with you in case you forgot some words. Unless you do something, she won't come back. (If you don't do anything, ... ) </p>

<p> Conditional sentences </p>
<p> Watch out: </p>
<p> 1) Which type of the conditional sentences is used? </p>
<p> 2) Where is the if-clause (e.g. at the beginning or at the end of the conditional sentence)? </p>
<p> + </p>
<p> If I studied, I would pass the exam. </p>
<p> If I studied, I'd pass the exam. </p>
<p> If I studied, I would not fail the exam. If I did not study, I would fail the exam. </p>
<p> If I studied, I wouldn't fail the exam. If I didn't study, I'd fail the exam. </p>

<p> 10) If he did not print the document, I would not correct it. </p>
<p> Conditionals - examples and grammar rules </p>
<p> There are four basic types of conditional sentences in the English language. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Zero conditional: I take my umbrella if it rains. </p>
<p> First conditional: I'll call you if I work late. </p>
<p> Second conditional: If the bus didn't arrive on time, I would drive you to the airport. </p>
<p> Third conditional: She wouldn't have come if I hadn't invited her. </p>
<p> The zero conditional </p>
<p> The zero conditional describes situations that are always true. If has the same meaning as when or whenever. </p>
<p> If I go to school, I get up at seven. (Whenever I go to school I get up at the same time.) </p>
<p> If you park your car on double yellow lines, you pay a fine. (Whenever you park illegally, you pay a fine.) </p>
<p> We use the present simple tense in both the main clauses and the if clauses. </p>
<p> The first conditional (unit 9) </p>
<p> The first conditional sentences are used to speculate about possible situations that can really happen at present or in future. </p>
<p> We do not use will in an if clause to describe future activities (compare it to time clauses). </p>
<p> If he studies hard, he'll pass the exams. If we catch the 10.15 train, we will arrive on time. If you don't get the ticket, what will you do? </p>
<p> We make if clauses with if + present tense and main clauses with will + bare infinitive. </p>
<p> The second conditional (unit 12) </p>
<p> In the second conditional sentences we speculate about situations that will probably never happen at present or in future. </p>
<p> If I had more time, I would help you. (But I am not free at the moment. I can't help you). </p>
<p> If I won a million dollars, I would start a business of my own. (But I know that it is not realistic.) </p>
<p> We make if clauses with if + past tense and main clauses with would + bare infinitive. </p>
<p> Note: the verb to be can be specific in the if clause. </p>
<p> If I were rich, I wouldn't work. If he were younger, he would marry her. </p>
<p> (But was is also possible: If I was rich, I wouldn't work. If he was younger, he would marry her.) </p>
<p> But: If I were you, I wouldn't do it. (In this expression, were is much more usual than was.) </p>
<p> Compare the first and second conditional </p>
<p> The main difference between them is about probability: the first conditional is realistic, the second is unrealistic. </p>
<p> Sometimes we can use both with the following difference in meaning. </p>
<p> If I see him, I will tell him. (I suppose I will see him, because we go to the same school.) </p>
<p> If I saw him, I would tell him. (I don't think I will see him, because he is ill.) </p>
<p> If I need your help, I'll call you. (It is probable that I will need your help.) </p>
<p> If I needed your help, I'd call you. (It is not very probable that I will need your help.) </p>
<p> Sometimes we must use either the first conditional or the second conditional to make it clear that the situation is real or unreal. </p>
<p> If you get up late, you will miss your bus. (a real situation) </p>
<p> If I came from your country, I would understand your problems. (an unreal situation - I am not from your country.) </p>
<p> Other forms </p>
<p> Apart from the basic structures (if + the present simple + will and if + the past simple + would), we can also make different combinations. </p>
<p> Examples - type 1: </p>
<p> If you have finished your dinner, you can ask for the bill. </p>
<p> If you meet her, could you let me know? </p>
<p> If we were on holiday, we would be lying on a beach now. </p>
<p> Why are we watching this film? If we were watching the news, it would be more interesting. </p>
<p> The third conditional </p>
<p> The third conditional sentences always refer to the past. We speculate about situations that happened or did not happen in the past. </p>
<p> If I had won a million, I would have started a business of my own. (But I didn't win anything.) </p>
<p> If he had met her, he would have told her. (Unfortunately, he didn't meet her.) </p>
<p> If we hadn't practised, we wouldn't have won the match. (But we practised and won.) </p>
<p> We make if clauses with if + past perfect and main clauses with would + perfect infinitive (have + past participle). </p>
<p> But we can also combine other verb structures in third conditional sentences. </p>
<p> We didn't save any money. If we had saved some money, we might have bought the house. </p>
<p> She wasn't there and I wasn't sitting next to her. But if she had been there, I would have been sitting next to her. </p>
<p> I was looking at the trees when I fell off the bike. If I hadn't been looking at the trees, I wouldn' t have fallen off the bike. </p>
<p> The mixed conditionals </p>
<p> In the mixed conditional sentences we can combine the second and third conditional. </p>
<p> If he had left immediately, he would be here now. (He didn't leave immediately and isn't here.) </p>
<p> If I had studied hard when I was young, I wouldn't be a porter now. (I didn't study and I am a porter.) </p>
<p> If we hadn't told him the way while he was preparing for his journey, he would get lost now. (We told him and he isn't lost.) </p>
<p> The inverted conditionals </p>
<p> We can also make conditional sentences by changing the word order in the if clause. </p>
<p> Had he booked the hotel room, he wouln't have slept at the camp. (If he had booked ... ) </p>
<p> Were I in your position, I would accept it. (If I were ... ) </p>
<p> This is less common, quite formal and is mostly used in writing. </p>
<p> Note </p>
<p> If is the most frequent expression in the if clauses, but other expressions are also possible. </p>
<p> even if, provided (that), unless, on condition (that), in case </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> You will leave tonight even if you don't want to. </p>
<p> You can have your birthday party provided that you aren't noisy. </p>
<p> We'll sell you the ranch on condition you pay in cash. </p>
<p> You should take a dictionary with you in case you forgot some words. </p>
<p> Unless you do something, she won't come back. (If you don't do anything, ... ) </p>

<p> Conditionals Grammar </p>
<p> 1. CONDITIONALS Conditional Sentences Type 0 -> Used for scientific / general truth. -> Form: if + Simple Present , + Simple Present ( if + Past Simple , + Past Simple) -> Examples: - If you heat butter, it melts . - If I have time, I study English. - Years ago if people travelled a long distance, the journey took days. “ If ” may be replaced by “ when ”. </p>
<p> 2. The structure of a first conditional sentence A first conditional sentence consists of two clauses, an &quot;if&quot; clause and a main clause: If the &quot;if&quot; clause comes first, a comma is usually used. If the &quot;if&quot; clause comes second, there is no need for a comma: you will pass the test. If you study hard, main clause if clause if you study hard. You will pass the test if clause main clause </p>
<p> 3. The structure and use of a first conditional sentence We use different verb forms in each part of a first conditional: The first conditional is used to talk about things which are possible in the present or the future -- things which may happen : URL subject + will + verb main clause if + subject + simple present verb if clause Maybe you will cook the supper -- that's possible. If you cook the supper, I'll wash the dishes. Maybe Juan will leave -- that's possible. Paula will be sad if Juan leaves. Maybe it will be sunny -- that's possible. If it's sunny, we'll go to the park. Explanation Example </p>
<p> 4. CONDITIONALS Conditional Sentences Type 1 -> It is possible and also very likely that the condition will be fulfilled. -> Form : if + Simple Present , will ( Future ) can / must / may ( if + Present Perfect , ) imperatives -> Examples: - If I find her address, I’ll send her an invitation. - If you have studied for this exam, you will pass it. - If it is hot today, we may go swimming. - If you see her, don’t tell her I was here. - If you go to the supermarket, you can buy some bread URL </p>
<p> 5. CONDITIONALS Conditional Sentences Type 2 -> T here is an unreal possibility that the condition will happen. -> Form : if + Past Simple , would ( Conditional ) could / might -> Examples: - If you did your homework more often, your teacher wouldn´t get angry with you. - If they left early, they might get to the theatre on time. - If I were you, I wouldn´t buy that expensive coat. - If I went to the supermarket I could get some bread. </p>
<p> 6. Second conditional: unreal situations <ul><li>Look at the following sentences. In the second sentence, what verb tense is used in each part? </li></ul><ul><li>The mountain-biker says: Be prepared for some hard work. If the training was easy, it wouldn't make you faster. </li></ul><ul><li>We use the second conditional when we think something is unreal or unlikely. Does he think the training will ever be easy? </li></ul> </p>
<p> 7. Match the sentence halves. <ul><li>1 If I did more sport, </li></ul><ul><li>2 I'd be really happy if </li></ul><ul><li>3 If I could sing, </li></ul><ul><li>4 My parents would be really angry if </li></ul><ul><li>5 If I studied harder, </li></ul><ul><li>6 If I had a lot of money, </li></ul><ul><li>7 If I could drive, </li></ul><ul><li>A I had a party without telling them . </li></ul><ul><li>B I'd get much fitter. </li></ul><ul><li>C I'd go to South America. </li></ul><ul><li>D my father bought me a motorbike. </li></ul><ul><li>E I'd be in a band. </li></ul><ul><li>F I'd go to the coast more often. </li></ul><ul><li>G I'd speak better English. </li></ul> </p>
<p> 8. CONDITIONALS <ul><li>Conditional Sentences Type 3 </li></ul><ul><li>-> T he important thing about the third conditional is that both the condition and result are impossible now. </li></ul><ul><li>-> Form : if + Past Perfect , would have + P.P. </li></ul><ul><li> could / might / should </li></ul><ul><li> have + P.P. </li></ul><ul><li>-> Examples: </li></ul><ul><li>We would have come yesterday if we had known about it. </li></ul><ul><li>If I had waited longer last night, I might have found out about it. </li></ul><ul><li>- If I had gone to the supermarket I could have bought some bread. </li></ul> </p>
<p> 9. CONDITIONALS Other Conditionals -> unless (if … not), in case, provided/providing (that), as/so long as. -> Examples: - I´ll go swimming tomorrow unless it rains . - You can play with your friends in your room provided that you tidy up afterwards. - I´ll help you as long as you come with me to the cinema. - I´ll take my umbrella with me in case it rains . </p>
<p> 10. CONDITIONALS <ul><li>Mixed Conditionals </li></ul><ul><li>-> If-clauses can be mixed provided that they make sense within a context. </li></ul><ul><li>-> Examples: </li></ul><ul><li>If they were studying all morning, they will be tired now. </li></ul><ul><li>(they were studying so they are tired now.) </li></ul><ul><li>If I were faster, I would have won the race. </li></ul><ul><li>(I´m not fast so I didn´t win the race.) </li></ul><ul><li>If she had saved her money, she would go on holiday </li></ul><ul><li>(she didn´t save her money so she won´t go on holiday.) </li></ul> </p>

<p> Conditionals </p>
<p> What are conditionals in English grammar? Sometimes we call them 'if clauses'. They describe the result of something that might happen (in the present or future) or might have happened but didn't (in the past) . They are made using different English verb tenses. </p>
<p> The Zero Conditional: (if + present simple, ... present simple) If you heat water to 100 degrees, it boils. Click here to learn more. </p>
<p> The First Conditional: (if + present simple, ... will + infinitive) If it rains tomorrow, we'll go to the cinema. Click here to learn more. </p>
<p> The Second Conditional: (if + past simple, ... would + infinitive) If I had a lot of money, I would travel around the world. Click here to learn more. </p>
<p> The Third Conditional (if + past perfect, ... would + have + past participle) If I had gone to bed early, I would have caught the train. Click here to learn more. </p>
<p> (Notice we can put 'if' at the beginning, or in the middle. It doesn't matter at all.) </p>

<p> Conditionals: if </p>
<p> Imagined conditions </p>
<p> There are different types of conditions. Some are possible or likely, others are unlikely, and others are impossible: </p>
<p> If the weather improves, we’ll go for a walk. (It is possible or likely that the weather will improve.) </p>
<p> If the weather improved, we could go for a walk. (It is not likely that the weather will improve.) </p>
<p> If the weather had improved, we could have gone for a walk. (The weather did not improve – fine weather is therefore an impossible condition.) </p>
<p> These types of conditions are used in three types of sentences, called first, second and third conditional sentences. </p>
<p> Imagined conditions: the first conditional </p>
<p> We use the first conditional to talk about the result of an imagined future situation, when we believe the imagined situation is quite likely: </p>
<p> [imagined future situation]If the taxi doesn’t come soon, [future result]I’ll drive you myself. </p>
<p> First conditional: form </p>
<p> conditional clause </p>
<p> main clause </p>
<p> if + present simple </p>
<p> modal verb with future meaning (shall/should/will/would/can/could/may/might) </p>
<p> We use the modal verb in the main clause, not in the conditional clause. </p>
<p> If a lawyer reads the document, we will see if we’ve missed anything important. </p>
<p> Not: If a lawyer will read the document… </p>
<p> Imagined conditions: the second conditional </p>
<p> We use the second conditional to talk about the possible result of an imagined situation in the present or future. We say what the conditions must be for the present or future situation to be different. </p>
<p> If people complained, things would change. (People don’t complain at themoment.) </p>
<p> Second conditional: form </p>
<p> conditional clause </p>
<p> main clause </p>
<p> if + past simple </p>
<p> modal verb with future-in-the-past meaning (should/would/might/could) </p>
<p> If you asked her nicely, </p>
<p> she would say yes, I’m sure. </p>
<p> We use a past form in the conditional clause to indicate a distance from reality, rather than indicating past time. We often use past forms in this way in English. </p>
<p> Warning: </p>
<p> We use would in the main clause, not in the conditional clause: </p>
<p> If you decided to take the exam, you would have to register by 31 March. </p>
<p> First and second conditional compared </p>
<p> When we use the first conditional, we think the imagined situation is more likely to happen than when we use the second conditional. </p>
<p> Compare </p>
<p> first conditional </p>
<p> second conditional </p>
<p> If the flight’s late, we’ll miss our connection. </p>
<p> (it’s possible or likely that the flight will be late) </p>
<p> If there were more buses, we would leave the car at home. (it is unlikely that there will be more buses) </p>
<p> I’ll come and give a hand if you need help moving your stuff. (it is possible or likely that you will need help) </p>
<p> He would buy a flat if he had the money for a deposit. (it is unlikely that he will have the money) </p>
<p> Imagined conditions: the third conditional </p>
<p> We use the third conditional when we imagine a different past, where something did or did not happen, and we imagine a different result: </p>
<p> If I had played better, I would have won. (I didn’t play well and I didn’t win.) </p>
<p> It would have been easier if George had brought his own car. (George didn’t bring his own car, so the situation was difficult.) </p>
<p> If the dog hadn’t barked, we wouldn’t have known there was someone in the garden. (The dog barked, so we knew there was someone in the garden.) </p>
<p> Third conditional: form </p>
<p> conditional clause </p>
<p> main clause </p>
<p> if + past perfect </p>
<p> modal verb with future-in-the-past meaning (should/would/might/could) + have + -ed form </p>
<p> If they had left earlier, </p>
<p> they would have arrived on time. </p>
<p> Warning: </p>
<p> We use would have + -ed in the main clause, not in the conditional clause: </p>
<p> If he had stayed in the same room as Dave, it would have been a disaster. </p>
<p> Not: If he would have stayed … it would have been a disaster. </p>
<p> People do sometimes use the form with would have in informal speaking, but many speakers consider it incorrect. </p>
<p> Real conditionals </p>
<p> Some conditions seem more real to us than others. Real conditionals refer to things that are true, that have happened, or are very likely to happen: </p>
<p> If you park here, they clamp your wheels. (It is always true that they clamp your wheels if, or every time, you park here.) </p>
<p> If I can’t sleep, I listen to the radio. (it is often true that I can’t sleep, so I listen to the radio) </p>
<p> In real conditional sentences, we can use the present simple or present continuous in both clauses for present situations, and the past simple or past continuous in both clauses for past situations. We can use these in various different combinations. </p>
<p> Present simple + present simple </p>
<p> If the weather is fine, we eat outside on the terrace. (Every time this happens, this is what we do.) </p>
<p> Present continuous + present simple </p>
<p> If the kids are enjoying themselves, we just let them go on playing till they’re ready for bed. (Every time this happens, this is what we do.) </p>
<p> Present continuous + present continuous </p>
<p> If the economy is growing by 6%, then it is growing too fast. (If it is true that the economy is growing by 6%, then it is true that it is growing too fast.) </p>
<p> Past simple + past simple </p>
<p> If my father had a day off, we always went to see my granddad. (Every time that happened in the past, that is what we did.) </p>
<p> Past simple + past continuous </p>
<p> Kevin always came in to say hello if he was going past our house. (Every time he was going past our house, that is what he did.) </p>
<p> We can also use modal verbs in the main clause: </p>
<p> If we go out, we can usually get a baby sitter. (Every time we go out, it is usually possible to get a babysitter.) </p>
<p> If we wanted someone to fix something, we would ask our neighbour. He was always ready to help. (Every time we wanted someone, we would ask our neighbour.) </p>
<p> (It is less likely or unlikely that we will get more students.) </p>
<p> If the rent had been lower, I would have taken the flat. </p>
<p> (The rent was not low enough.) </p>
<p> If + should </p>
<p> We can use if with should to refer to events which might happen by chance or by accident: </p>
<p> If you should bump into Carol, can you tell her I’m looking for her? (If by chance you bump into Carol.) </p>
<p> If the government should ever find itself in this situation again, it is to be hoped it would act more quickly. </p>
<p> Conditional clauses with will or would </p>
<p> Will and would can be used in conditional clauses, either with the meaning of ‘being willing to do something’, or to refer to later results: </p>
<p> If Clare will meet us at the airport, it will save us a lot of time. (if Clare is willing to meet us) </p>
<p> If you would all stop shouting, I will try and explain the situation! </p>
<p> If it will make you happy, I’ll stay at home tonight. (If it is true that you will be happy as a result, I’ll stay at home tonight.) </p>
<p> We sometimes stress the will or would, especially if we doubt that the result will be the one mentioned: </p>
<p> If it really would save the planet, I’d stop using my car tomorrow. (If it really is true that the planet would be saved as a result, I would stop using my car, but I doubt it is true.) </p>
<p> Mixed conditionals </p>
<p> Often, things that did or did not happen in the past have results which continue or are still important in the present. We can emphasise this by using if with a past perfect verb, and would in the main clause. </p>
<p> If I hadn’t met Charles, I wouldn’t be here now. (I met Charles so I’m here now.) </p>
<p> She wouldn’t still be working for us if we hadn’t given her a pay-rise. (We gave her a pay-rise so she is still working for us now.) </p>
<p> Conditionals in speaking </p>
<p> Spoken English: </p>
<p> In speaking, we often use if-clauses without main clauses, especially when asking people politely to do things. If is usually followed by will, would, can or could when it is used to be polite: </p>
<p> [Shop assistant to customer] </p>
<p> If you would just sign here, please. (a more polite way of saying Just sign here, please.) </p>
<p> [A is writing something for B and having difficulty] </p>

CONDITIONAL SENTENCES
by Jane Lawson at DailyStep.com

Conditional sentences have a main clause and a conditional clause. There are
five types of conditional sentences in English. Today we are going to look in
detail at two of these types: Zero Conditional and First Conditional.
ZERO CONDITIONAL
We use this for scientific facts and for general truths, in other words, for things
which are always true. The structure is:

CONDITION CLAUSE

MAIN CLAUSE

If + present tense

present simple

If you heat ice,

it melts.

If he is reading,

he wears glasses.

FIRST CONDITIONAL
We use this to express things that are possible in the future. The structure is:

CONDITION CLAUSE

MAIN CLAUSE

If + present tense

future simple

If you hurry,

you will catch the train.

Unless you hurry,

you will miss the train.

Conditional clauses often start with the conjunction IF, but conditionals can
also start with other conjunctions, such as AS LONG AS or UNLESS. Here are
some examples:

CONDITION CLAUSE

Speak Good English!

If + present tense

zero conditional:
present simple
I go for a walk every day.

If is it warm
Provided that it is warm
Provided it is warm
Providing it is warm
As long as it is warm
So long as it is warm
Unless it is cold

first conditional:
future simple
I will go for a walk tomorrow.

This last conjunction, UNLESS means ‘IF… NOT’ so it has a negative meaning.
In Zero Conditionals only, we can also use WHEN as a conjunction. So we
can say:
When it is warm, I go for a walk every day.
When you heat ice, it melts.

So, what is the difference between these conjunctions?

o

PROVIDED, PROVIDED THAT and PROVIDING are more formal. They are
often used in Business, Academic and Legal English.

o

AS LONG AS and SO LONG AS are more emphatic. So they emphasise the
condition, and these sentences sound stronger.

o

WHEN and IF are more general.
Now, make your own sentences like these, and make sure they are true to your
own life as this will help you to remember them better.
You can learn to speak, write and understand conditional sentences in DailyStep
Audio Lessons, from Levels 3 to 5. In my next blog on DailyStep English, I
will cover SECOND and THIRD CONDITIONALS.

<p> Blog </p>
<p> Vocabulary: Differences between travel, journey, trip, voyage and tour </p>
<p> The Summer holidays are around the corner so it is definitely a good time to post an article on my blog explaining the difference between all these words. </p>
<p> Travel, journey, trip, voyage and tour can be easily confused by all those students learning English, so below are clear explanations of how to use the 5 terms: </p>
<p> Travel: </p>
<p> The word travel is used to talk about the act of travelling in general. </p>
<p> 1. My hobbies are music and travel (en vez de 'I love cinema and travel') </p>
<p> Travel can be both a noun and verb. As a noun, it names the act of going from one place to another; and as a verb it describes the action of doing so. </p>
<p> *Verbs: Louise travels a lot for work *Nouns: Travel the way you wish to go </p>
<p> *Nouns: Travel the way you wish to go *Verbs: People spend a lot of money on travel </p>
<p> In some instances the noun travel can be used in the plural, especially when visiting multiple places. </p>
<p> Example: Where have you been on your travels? </p>
<p> Journey </p>
<p> Journey is used to refer to the time of travelling from A -- (necesito una flecha!!) B and how, e.g. bus journey, car journey and train journey. </p>
<p> *How was your journey? (en vez de Did you have a good journey?) </p>
<p> *The journey was terrible, it took us 10 hours to arrive to the capital. </p>
<p> Voyage </p>
<p> Voyage is used to describe a journey that is long and challenging with the aim of discovering new places, e.g. a voyage into space or a voyage across seas. </p>
<p> *Marco Polo went on many voyages and discovered many new places </p>
<p> *The astronauts were very happy to arrive after their long voyage </p>
<p> Trip </p>
<p> A trip refers to the journey taken for pleasure or business, e.g. a boat trip or business trip. </p>
<p> *I remember my first school trip to Barcelona Zoo *My first business trip in China was to Shanghai </p>
<p> Tour </p>
<p> Tour refers to the organized act of seeing a place of its sights, e.g. a tour of the city or a tour of a country. We went on a nice tour around the South of Spain for ten days </p>
<p> *My favourite band is touring around Europe at the moment </p>

<p> English Articles (a, an, the)! Learn how to use articles (a, an, the) in English with useful grammar rules, ESL printable worksheets and example sentences. When studying English grammar, you may have come across the article. We are going to take a look at what an article is, how it is used and the rules surrounding it. We are going to do this by taking a look at some examples of articles in use within a sentence, this way we will be able to gain a greater understanding of its function. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> What Is An Article? </p>
<p> What Is An Article in English? A An The </p>
<p> In English grammar, there are two different types of article, the definite article and the indefinite article. In the most simple terms an article is a way of letting the listener or speaker know that a noun is either unspecific or specific. The words which are used as articles are the, an and a. </p>
<p> Let’s take a look at some examples to clarify the meaning of an article. </p>
<p> During the long journey, the family played car games. </p>
<p> You can see that when we use the article ‘the’ that we are showing that we are talking about a specific day and also a specific family. However, if we change the article, we can show that we are not talking about a specific journey or family. Take a look at the example now: </p>
<p> During a long journey, a family can play car games. </p>
<p> Simply by changing the article, we have made the sentence a more general statement and not about a specific thing or person. </p>
<p> Quick note: </p>
<p> Articles are small but important words in the English language. </p>
<p> Articles are considered adjectives because they modify or help describe nouns. </p>
<p> Articles always come before or precede the nouns they describe. </p>
<p> There are only three articles in English: a, an and the. </p>
<p> There are two types of articles indefinite ‘a’ and ‘an‘ or definite ‘the’. You also need to know when not to use an article. </p>
<p> In many languages, articles are a special part of speech which cannot be easily combined with other parts of speech. </p>
<p> Article Grammar: A An The – Image 1 </p>
<p> Different Types Of Article </p>
<p> As we mentioned, in English there are two different types of article, the definite article and the indefinite article. They are each used for their own purpose and we are now going to take a look at these in a little more depth. </p>
<p> Definite Article </p>
<p> The best way to remember what a definite article is, is to remember that the word ‘the’ is the definite article. As we have briefly seen in our earlier examples, the word the can be used to demonstrate that the speaker is referring to something specific and not talking in a general sense. </p>
<p> When using a definite article, it can be combined with either a plural, a singular or an uncountable noun. We are now going to take a look at some examples of the definite article being used within a sentence. </p>
<p> Please show me the photo. </p>
<p> Can I see the blue dress, I do not like the red one. </p>
<p> Are we going to watch the football game? </p>
<p> I need the long wire, it is the only wire which will reach the plug socket. </p>
<p> Indefinite Article </p>
<p> When we are talking about the indefinite article, we are referring to the words ‘a’ and ‘an’ and depending on which word they are referring to, will depend on which one you use. </p>
<p> If the noun begins with a vowel, you should use ‘an.’ </p>
<p> If the nouns begins with a consonant, you should use ‘a.’ </p>
<p> We use the indefinite article as a way of demonstrating that we are not referring to a specific item or person but rather talking a more general sense. Let’s take a look at some examples of the indefinite article being used within a sentence. </p>
<p> I need to read a book, do you have a good one? </p>
<p> I am going to watch a movie, I am not sure which one. </p>
<p> There is an animal in the garden. </p>
<p> Sally has an invention she is working on. </p>
<p> How to Use Articles in English Grammar? (A An The) </p>
<p> Rules For Using An Article </p>
<p> There are a variety of rules when it comes to using either a definite or an indefinite (did you notice the use of ‘a’ and ‘an’ in this sentence?) Let’s now take a look at the rules surrounding this grammatical element in order that we use it correctly. </p>
<p> Rule #1. We mentioned that depending on whether the noun begins with a consonant or a vowel will depend on which form of the indefinite article you will use, however like many times in the English language, there are some exceptions to this rule. The best example of this is with the word ‘honour’ which begins with a consonant, however this letter is not pronounced so you would not use the word ‘a’ in this instance, you would say: </p>
<p> It is an honour to meet the Queen. </p>
<p> The same rule applies when a word begins with a vowel which is pronounced as though it were a consonant. An example of this would be: </p>
<p> He is an United Nations representative. </p>
<p> Rule #2. If you are using a noun which has been modified by an adjective, then the article should come before the adjective and should correspond to the adjective rather than the noun. For example, the noun ‘igloo’ would usually take the article ‘an’ however if you wanted to describe it as being large, you would create a sentence as follows: </p>
<p> The inuit people traditionally lived in a large igloo. </p>
<p> Another example of this would be if you were going to refer to the noun ‘book’ which would usually take the article ‘a’ however if you wanted to describe the book as being amazing, then you would create a sentence as follows: </p>
<p> Last week I read an amazing book. </p>
<p> Rule #3. When you are using an uncountable noun (this is a noun which cannot be counted or is infinite or intangible. Some examples of these might be sand, wine, soda, air, information etc) you should never use the indefinite article. The reason for this is that this form of article is only used for singular nouns. You may, however use words such as some when talking about these uncountable nouns. Let’s take a look at some examples. </p>
<p> If you were to say the following sentence, it would not make any sense. </p>
<p> Please give the dog a water. </p>
<p> Because the noun is uncountable, the use of the indefinite article does not sound correct, however if you were to use the definite article, this would not make sense either as you would be asking for a specific thing, consider the following sentence: </p>
<p> Please give the dog the water. </p>
<p> Unless there is a specific bowl of water waiting to be given to the dog, this sentence would not be correct. If you wish to refer to an uncountable noun in this way, the correct sentence would be as follows: </p>
<p> Please give the dog some water. </p>
<p> Rule #4. If you are using an article with a possessive pronoun, the rules change once again. In actual fact, the use of these two together does not make much sense. Look at the following sentence: </p>
<p> Have you got the my coat? </p>
<p> This is not correct as you cannot use an article with a possessive pronoun, therefore the article should be omitted. </p>
<p> Rule #5. Finally, there may be times where an article can be left out, as it is not necessary to refer to the noun. A good example of this would be the sentence ‘I like to play football.’ Whilst football is a noun, using the before it would be unnecessary and so the article is not included. </p>
<p> Indefinite Articles | A and An </p>
<p> Indefinite Article Definition </p>
<p> The words A and An are called indefinite articles. We can use them with singular nouns to talk about any single person or thing. </p>
<p> Deciding which indefinite article to place in front of a word depends upon the initial sound of the word, not the first letter of the word. </p>
<p> E.g. An hour, an elephant, an actor, an ice-cream. </p>
<p> How to Use A, AN – Image 2 </p>
<p> Rules for Using A, An – Image 3 </p>
<p> Definite Article | The </p>
<p> Definite Article Definition </p>
<p> The Definite Article ‘THE‘ generally specifies and identifies. It answers the question: ‘Which one?’ Is specifies a person, place, or thing already mentioned. </p>
<p> The definite article ‘the’ means this, that. It answers the question which one?. It can be used with both singular and plural nouns. A noun is first introduced with the indefinite article and the definite article is used to refer to it again. </p>
<p> Article Grammar: The Article THE in Geographical Names – Image 4 </p>
<p> When Not to Use an English Article </p>
<p> 1. We usually use no article to talk about things in general. </p>
<p> 2. We do not use an article when talking about sports and games. </p>
<p> 3. Do not use article before the names of countries unless the name suggests that the country is made up of smaller units or constituent parts. </p>
<p> Use the – the UK (United Kingdom), the USA (United States of America), the Irish Republic… (Kingdom, state, republic and union are nouns, so they need an article.) </p>
<p> 4. Do not use article before the name of language. </p>
<p> 5. Do not use article before the names of railway stations when they are also place names. </p>
<p> 6. Do not use article before the names of meals if they refer to the meals generally, as a part of the daily routine. </p>
<p> 7. Do not use article before noun + number. </p>
<p> Article Grammar: When to Use No Article – Image 5 </p>
<p> Articles with Countable and Uncountable Nouns </p>
<p> You need to categorize the noun as count or noncount to choose the correct article. </p>
<p> Countable nouns are individual objects, people, places, etc. which can be counted. </p>
<p> Examples: an apple, a school, 1 picture, 2 pictures, 3 pictures, 2 men, 4 men, 8 men. </p>
<p> Uncountable nouns are materials, concepts, information, etc. which are not individual objects and can not be counted. </p>
<p> Articles with Countable and Uncountable Nouns – Image 6 </p>
<p> Conclusion </p>
<p> An article is a very important part of English grammar and how they are used always depends on the noun that they are referring to, unless that noun in being modified by an adjective, in this case the article will correspond with the adjective. There are various rules surrounding the use of articles, yet these are simple and easy to learn. </p>

<p> Your sentence is correct. Here you are speaking about an author in general. You are not speaking about any specific author. So, you have to use any of the indefinite articles (a or an). Since the word “author” begins with a consonant sound, you have to use ‘an’. </p>

<p> The sentence is not correct as it is missing ‘a’ before unique style of writing. Also author is a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u) , not a consonant sound. </p>

<p> English Conditionals </p>
<p> Welcome to the English Conditionals section. In this section we will cover all four English conditional. </p>
<p> What is a conditional? </p>
<p> A conditional is a sentence or part of a sentence that expresses a condition. It usually begins with the words "when," "if" and "unless." A condition is what must happen before something else can happen. Examples of conditionals (note that the conditions are in italics): I will come if I have enough time. (I am not sure that I will come. It depends on something else.) She would tell me if she knew. (She doesn't know.) Unless she agrees to pay us we will not take the job. (She must agree to pay before we take the job.) They will come when I call them. (They will not come before I call them.) There are four basic conditionals in English, or in other words: there are four ways to express that something is dependent on something else. Note: in the examples below the conditions are in GREEN, and the results are in BROWN. </p>
<p> The First Conditional </p>
<p> "If he catches a fish, he will be very happy." </p>
<p> We use first conditional when talking about possible future events. Structure: If + Simple Present, + Will OR Will + If + Simple Present Examples: </p>
<p> Lisa will be very happy if she wins the prize. </p>
<p> If it rains, then we will stay at home. </p>
<p> You will always be able to take another test if you fail. </p>
<p> If I see Sam, I will ask him to give you a call. </p>
<p> Note: You can use these modal verbs instead of will: shall, can, may. Examples: </p>
<p> The Second Conditional </p>
<p> "If I met a genie, I would ask for infinite wealth..." </p>
<p> We use the second conditional when talking about future events that are not likely to happen. </p>
<p> Structure: </p>
<p> If + Simple Past, + Would + Base Form OR Would + Base Form + If + Simple Past Examples: </p>
<p> If I won a million dollars, I would travel around the world. (There is a small possibility that I would actually win.) </p>
<p> If I met him again, I would tell him the truth. (There is a small possibility that I would actually meet him again.) </p>
<p> She would quit school if her parents agreed. (It is unlikely that her parents agree.) </p>
<p> I would be surprised if I saw pigs in the sky. (It is very unlikely for me to see pigs in the sky.) </p>
<p> We also use the second conditional when talking about things which are contrary to the present facts. </p>
<p> "If I had any money, I would give you some." </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If she worked less, she wouldn't be so tired. (In reality she doesn't work less, so she is tired.) </p>
<p> You would see John if you were here now. (In reality you are not here now, so you don't see John.) </p>
<p> If things were different, we would be happy. (In reality things are not different, and we are not happy.) </p>
<p> We would be good friends if she were nicer. (In reality she is not nice, and we are not good friends.) </p>
<p> Note: You can use these modal verbs instead of would: should, could, might. Examples: </p>
<p> If she didn't have her job, she could come with us to the North Pole. </p>
<p> If they wanted to move, they could sell the house to us. </p>
<p> Note: The short form of would is 'd. For example: If Kathleen were at home, she'd pick up the phone. </p>
<p> The verb BE </p>
<p> The verb BE has a special rule in this case. Usually we say: I was, he was, she was, it was, we were, you were, they were. However, in these cases, we use: I were, he were, she were, it were, we were, you were, they were. In other words: "were" is the only form. Examples: If I were you I would apologize. (In reality I am not you.) I would fight back, if I were you. (In reality I am not you.) </p>
<p> The Third Conditional </p>
<p> "If I had paid more attention, I wouldn't have hit myself..." </p>
<p> We use the third conditional when talking about things which are contrary to the past facts. In other words: events that did not happen in the past. </p>
<p> Structure: </p>
<p> If + Past Perfect, + Would have + V3 OR Would have + V3 + If + Past Perfect Examples: </p>
<p> If I had woken up on time, I would have taken the bus. (What really happened was that I didn't wake up on time, and so I didn't take the bus.) </p>
<p> Tom would have helped us if he had known we were there. (What really happened was that he didn't know we were there, and so he didn't help us.) </p>
<p> If I had told Sarah the truth, I would have felt much better. (What really happened was that I didn't tell Sarah the truth, and so I didn't feel so good.) </p>
<p> If it hadn't rained yesterday, we would have enjoyed a nice picnic. (What really happened was that it rained yesterday, and we didn't go for a picnic.) </p>
<p> Note #1: The short form of had is 'd. For example: If he'd passed his exams, he would have gotten a diploma. Note #2: You can use these modal verbs instead of would have: should have, could have, might have. Examples: </p>
<p> Jessica might have gotten the job if she hadn't been so nervous. </p>
<p> You could have arrived on time if you had used a map. </p>
<p> If she had known what to do, she should have told us. </p>
<p> The Zero Conditional </p>
<p> "If the sun sets, it becomes night." </p>
<p> We use the zero conditional when talking about things which are always true, or generally true. </p>
<p> Structure: </p>
<p> If + Simple Present, + Simple Present OR Simple Present + If + Simple Present Examples: </p>
<p> If you boil an egg, it becomes solid. </p>
<p> If you heat something, it becomes hotter. </p>
<p> I always listen to music if I jog. </p>
<p> Note: We can use "when" instead of "if." Examples: </p>

First and second conditional
Lesson code: DL7B-7EAB-8RR8-H

INTERMEDIATE +

1 Presentation
When we talk about possible or hypothetical situations with If ..., we can use a first conditional or second
conditional structure. Study the table below.

Structure

Examples and use

First conditional

According to the weather forecast, it might rain tonight.
If it rains, I'll stay at home.

If I do ..., I'll (= I will) ...

We use the first conditional when there is a real possibility that
Instead of will, we can use something will happen in the future.
other modal verbs, e.g. can,
might, may, must, should. If I don't call you tonight, you can call me.
Will you wait for me if I am late?
Second conditional

At the moment, it's raining. If it was sunny, I'd go out.

If I did ..., I'd (= I would) ... We use the second conditional when we imagine a situation or
when there is very little or no possibility that something will happen.
Instead of would, we can
use could or might.

What would you do if you found a lot of money in the street?
If it wasn't dark outside, we could go out.

Things to remember
• We do not use will or would in the if-part of a conditional sentence:
If it will rain rains, I'll stay at home.
• The if-part of the sentence can go at the beginning or at the end:
If it rains, I'll stay at home.

I'll stay at home if it rains.

• In the second conditional we use if + past (if I did, if I didn't, etc.), but the meaning is not past. In this
type of structure, the past tense refers to an imaginary or hypothetical situation, such as finding a lot of
money in the street:
What would you do if you found a lot of money in the street?
• In a first conditional sentence, we can use when instead of if for things that we are sure will happen:

<p> First conditional </p>
<p> Using the first conditional </p>
<p> First conditionals talk about a possible future situation and its result. </p>
<p> If you go out, you'll have fun. </p>
<p> Careful! The first half looks like the present simple, but it's a possibility in the future. </p>
<p> We often use this form to make promises or threats, or to negotiate. </p>
<p> I'll buy you a present if I go on holiday. (promise) </p>
<p> I'll hit you if you do that again! (threat) </p>
<p> If you lend me £5, I'll buy you a drink later. (negotiation) </p>
<p> How to make the first conditional </p>
<p> If + present simple (for the future situation), will/won't + verb (for the result). </p>
<p> If you don't help me, I won't finish my work. </p>
<p> Things to remember: </p>
<p> It doesn't matter if you say the situation or the result first. I'll help you if you want = If you want, I'll help you. </p>
<p> You can use unless to mean if (you) don't. I won't go shopping if I don't have time. = I won't go shopping unless I have time. </p>
<p> First conditional: advanced points </p>
<p> You can use present simple, continuous or perfect to give the possible situation. </p>
<p> You can use any expression which talks about the future for the result. </p>

<p> Questions? </p>

<p> First conditional in English </p>
<p> In this chapter the first conditional will be explained. This conditional refers to a real or possible situation. </p>
<p> Definition and usage of the first conditional </p>
<p> The first conditional is used to refer to a real or possible situation. The first conditional is used to make warnings, to express facts or to make statements about reality and about particular situations. The table below shows the usage of this conditional. </p>
<p> Situation </p>
<p> Example </p>
<p> You want to express probable events in the future. </p>
<p> If it rains today, I will not go out of the house. </p>
<p> Structure of the first conditional in English </p>
<p> In the first conditional sentences a possible condition and the probable result are expressed. </p>
<p> Structure: If + present simple + future simple </p>
<p> The table below shows the structure of the first conditional sentences and the tenses that are used to form the sentences. </p>
<p> As with all conditional sentences, the order of the two parts of the sentence are not fixed and can be modified without altering the meaning. </p>
<p> Modal verbs in the first conditional </p>
<p> In the first conditional the verb 'will' can be replaced by modal verbs like: may, should or can to express an opinion or to change the probability of an event. </p>
<p> Examples </p>
<p> If you finish your homework, you can go to the party. </p>
<p> If you feel bad, you should see a doctor. </p>
<p> If it is sunny tomorrow, we can go to the beach. </p>

<p> Hands down one of the best teachers I've had the pleasure of working with. Very knowledgeable in all aspects of Bulgarian (grammar rules, expressions, ...) but also in both English and French, which helps whenever you have a more in-depth question on the how or why something is the way it is in Bulgarian. Furthermore he has his own material and always comes prepared, but he is equally open to changing the subject of a lesson to suit your needs. He is patient, positive and not too scholarly, which is what you need as an adult learning day- to- day Bulgarian.I have been working with him for 18 months now and still look forward to our lessons every week. </p>
<p> An's Bulgarian has tremendously improved since she gave it go a year and a half ago. Of course, It goes without saying that I am pleased to work with such an enthusiastic learner who is living proof that, through hard work and perseverance, everyone can succeed in their language goals. An, you are now an independant user of the language who is able to successfully lead real-live conversations. Pat yourself on the back. </p>

<p> Elena is an excellent teacher and a very nice person. I have been training in Spanish with Elena for quite some time now after her being recommended to me by a friend, and have consistently been very pleased with our lessons. While I do not consider myself to be very good at learning foreign languages, Elena is very patient and adapts the lessons to my ability, making me feel at ease. In fact, I find her to be extremely skilled at assessing exactly where I am at any given time with respect to my individual learning situation, and structuring the lessons accordingly. I think I probably would have given up trying to learn Spanish had I not began my study with Elena; and that would have been a shame considering where I am now with the language. Because of Elena's skilled help, I am extremely pleased to not only be conversant in basic Spanish, but also have confidence that I will one day reach full proficiency with the language. No other learning method I tried before meeting Elena compares to the one-on-one, personalized instruction I receive from her, which comprises reading; writing; developmental exercises; and most importantly, conversation. To be able to look at Spanish now and have it appear largely familiar is extremely satisfying. I even plan to study Italian with Elena after reaching my desired level in Spanish. These are not things I ever imagined would occur at the beginning stages of my studies. I am a native English speaker and find Elena's English to be excellent. She had no difficulty instructing me from the very beginning levels where it was necessary that a lot of English be spoken in our lessons, to where we are now with much less English being spoken. The friend who recommended Elena to me learned Dutch from her, and is equally pleased with their experience. I would not hesitate to learn from Elena any of the languages she teaches. I give Elena my highest recommendations and thank her for all the help she has provided me. </p>
<p> Thank you for your feedback, Brandon! I am very happy to know that you are so satisfied with the lessons. I've always believed that you could make it and I am glad that we never gave it up. The right attitude and a high level of perseverance have been the keys to your success. It has been a pleasure to be your guide in your learning process. I know that you can do much more, so let's continue towards a next level! </p>

I really recommend her to everyone willing to learn a new language :) </p>

<p> Deborah has been teaching me Italian for several months. I am very happy and look forward to the new lesson every week. She was immediately able to adapt to my level of knowledge of the Italian language. I can clearly see my progress every week. The lessons can be challenging, which I think is very good. I feel that she is pushing me to the next level. Great ! In addition she always provides me with excellent homework exercises. I really appreciate her patience when I am desperately searching for words during the conversation. In my opinion you can teach yourself a lot, but only with a teacher like Deborah can you achieve an excellent level of active use of language. To achieve this, I will need many more lessons with Deborah. As always we will have a lot of laughter and fun while doing this. </p>
<p> Thank you very much for your words! You are a very diligent student! You apply and take one step forward with each lesson! See you soon! </p>

<p> First Conditional: Welcom to Jamaica! (by Julian Velasco) </p>
<p> The Island is an excellent idea for your holidays o somebody who is thinking in a very funny travel. Don't matter who, If you have take decision of a place for a personal travel because you want get out of the country, you should think in Jamaica like a good or better choice.

Over the years it has attracted the rich and the famous and has been the haunt of royalty. </p>
<p> A paragraph using the first conditional (By Diana Perdomo) </p>
<p> Jamaica is an excellent country because If you go to Jamaica, You will find many different cultures. When you travel to this country, You would learn many aspects about this country. If you want to know about the cities that Jamaica has, you will learn that Jamaica has 5 important cities. Also when you travel to Jamaica, you can eat many typical fruits because this country has special and sweet fruits. But if you want to eat vegetables, you will be able to eat spinach, cabbage and pumpkin. When you stay in Jamaica and want to practice sports, you can play soccer and basketball. But if you want to listen to traditional music, you can listen to Ska, Reggae, Rocksteady, Dub, Dancehall and Ragga. When you travel to Jamaica, you might know about their industries. </p>
<p> A paragraph using the first conditional (By Sandra Garavito) </p>
<p> If you want to have a tranquil holiday in Jamaica, people have to go to Mandeville that is a hidden treasure of Jamaica. Mandeville has a pleasant climate. On the other hand if people want to have a night romantic in Mandeville, they can tour its bigger preference's magnificent restaurants, but if the tourists want a day of fun by the sea they can take a walk in helicopter, and a ride on a horse.Finally the Mandeville is a good alternative to pass holidays, besides the people also can tour eight rivers, Port Antonio, Negril, they are also tourist places. </p>

<p> The First Conditional </p>
<p> It's used to talk about things which might happen in the future. Of course, we can't know what will happen in the future, but this describes possible things, which could easily come true. </p>
<p> She'll be late if the train is delayed. </p>
<p> The first conditional describes a particular situation, whereas the zero conditional describes what happens in general. </p>
<p> For example (zero conditional): if you sit in the sun, you get burned (here I'm talking about every time a person sits in the sun - the burning is a natural consequence of the sitting) </p>
<p> But (first conditional): if you sit in the sun, you'll get burned (here I'm talking about what will happen today, another day might be different) </p>
<p> First vs. Second Conditional: </p>
<p> The first conditional describes things that I think are likely to happen in the future, whereas the second conditional talks about things that I don't think will really happen. It's subjective; it depends on my point of view. </p>
<p> For example (first conditional): If she studies harder, she'll pass the exam (I think it's possible she will study harder and so she'll pass) </p>
<p> But (second conditional): If she studied harder, she would pass the exam (I think that she won't study harder, or it's very unlikely, and so she won't pass) </p>

Distribute Handout: First Conditional to students. Students complete exercise A ‘Possibilities in my future’
in pairs. Check the answers together as a class.
Divide the class into Student As and Student Bs. Give a copy of the ’Whats my sentence?’ Student A
worksheet to each Student A, and a Student B worksheet to each Student B.
Demonstrate the activity by writing on the board:
If I make a lot of money, ...
On a piece of paper write the complete sentence, but don’t show it to the class, e.g. If I make a lot of
money, I’ll buy a big house.
Invite the class to guess what the rest of your sentence is. Elicit several possible endings until someone
offers the one you have written on the paper.
Focus on the worksheets and explain that half of each student’s sentences have gaps, and their partner
has the complete sentences. Students take turns trying to complete the sentences until they have said
the exact sentence their partner has. Their partner can help and prompt if necessary.
Student A begins. Make sure that students say the complete sentence each time, and not just the
missing words. Then Student B tries to complete their first sentence.
Feed back as a class.

2. Contextualized Activity (from ‘review’ to ‘free use’)
n

Speaking to the class: “We are talking to a friend, and telling them about possible activities in our town.”

Handout: First conditional
Grammar Presentation

Conditionals
First conditional

1 Some examples of first conditional sentences:
I’ll phone you later if I have time.
If you leave now, you won’t be late.

2 The first conditional pattern is:
if + subject + present simple + subject + will

2 We use the first conditional when

If I pass my exams, I’ll go to university.
We use a comma (,) after the ‘if’ part of the sentence in
this pattern.
The if clause can come second:
I’ll go to university if I pass my exams.
We can use negative verbs in the same patterns:
If I don’t pass my exams, I won’t go to university.
I won’t go to university if I fail my exams.
We can form questions with all these patterns:
What will you do if you don’t pass your exams?

TIP

Remember to use the present simple (NOT will/
won’t) after if in a first conditional sentence:
If I pass … (NOT if I will pass)
If I don’t pass … (NOT if I won’t pass)

Grammar in action
1 We use the first conditional to talk about possible

actions and situations in the future, and the results of

A

those actions and situations. The
‘if’ part of the sentence contains a
possible action or situation, and
the ‘will/won’t’ part of the sentence
contains the result:
If you run, you’ll catch the bus.
we are talking about possibilities
immediately after the present
moment:
You’ll be late for work if you don’t
get up now.
We also use the first conditional when we are
imagining and talking about possibilities a long time
in the future. Here, a child imagines life as an adult:
If I make a lot of money, I’ll live in a big house.

3 We can use may/might for the result, to say that the

result is only possible, not certain:
If I post this letter today, it might get there tomorrow.
We can use should for the result, to say that the result
is probable but not certain:
If I post this letter today, they should get it before the
end of the week.
We can use an imperative for the result, to give an
instruction or advice:
Here’s my card – if you need any help, give me a ring.

Possibilities in my future

forms of the verbs in brackets. Use the present simple or will/won’t. Use short forms.

<p> Zero and First Conditionals </p>
<p> Zero and First Conditionals </p>
<p> Zero and First Conditionals </p>
<p> In English, there are four common ‘conditional’ forms; the zero conditional, first conditional, second conditional and the third conditional. All four conditional forms are composed of two separate clauses; an if clause and a result clause. We use the ‘if clause’ to say ‘If this happens….” (se questo succede …) and the ‘result clause’ is used to say ‘this will happen’ (… questo accadrà). </p>
<p> The zero and first conditionals can be called ‘real conditionals’ and this page explains how they are used. The second and third conditionals can be called ‘unreal conditionals’ and you can find a guide to using them elsewhere in our grammar guide. </p>
<p> If we begin a conditional sentence with the conditional ‘if clause’, it is separated from the ‘result clause’ by a comma. If we start the sentence with a result clause, we do not separate them with a comma. </p>
<p> Zero Conditional </p>
<p> In English we use the ‘zero conditional’ to talk about something that is normally true. It is used, for example, to explain scientific facts and to explain what we normally do when certain things happen. The Zero conditional explains that when what we talk about in the conditional clause is true, then what we talk about in the result clause is also true. The Zero conditional can refer to past or present situations. </p>
<p> Basic Construction: </p>
<p> (If + subject + present simple verb), (subject + present simple verb.) </p>
<p> Or </p>
<p> (Subject + present simple verb) + (if + subject + present simple verb.)Examples: </p>
<p> With the first conditional, ‘if’ can normally be replaced by ‘When’: </p>
<p> When it snows, I don’t drive my car. </p>
<p> When my children don’t want to go to school, they pretend to be sick! </p>
<p> First Conditional </p>
<p> The first conditional is used to talk about the consequences of realistic, likely or possible future events. The first conditional is always used to speak about things which have not happened at the time of speaking. The speaker uses the ‘if’ clause to speak about the future event, and then the result clause to say what the consequence will be. </p>
<p> Basic Construction: </p>
<p> (If + subject + present simple verb) , (subject + will + verb.) </p>
<p> Or </p>
<p> (Subject + will + verb) (if + subject + present simple verb.) </p>
<p> For example </p>
<p> If he passes his exams, I will buy him a gift. </p>
<p> In the example above, ‘If he passes his exams’ is a realistic possibility in the opinion of the speaker. ‘I will buy him a gift’ is the consequence ‘if he passes his exams’. </p>
<p> If you wait for 10 minutes, I will drive you to the train station. (I think you will wait) </p>
<p> If my boss doesn’t give me a pay rise, I will look for another job. (I don’t think my boss will give me a pay rise) </p>
<p> If my parents buy a house near us, we can visit them every weekend! (I think they will buy a house near us) </p>
<p> If he is late again, I will sack him. (I believe he will be late again.) </p>
<p> If my phone rings while I am in the meeting, will you answer it for me? (It is possible my phone will ring) </p>
<p> If they increase their prices again, I will find another supplier. (It is possible they will increase their prices.) </p>
<p> First Conditional and the Imperative </p>
<p> When we talk about the future, we often give commands or instructions, using an imperative form (Stop talking!). We can also use an imperative form with in a first conditional sentence or question to give instructions. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If you see Robert, tell him to come to my office. </p>
<p> If you smoke in here, remember to open the windows first! </p>
<p> If you come home late, don’t make a lot of noise. </p>
<p> If you can’t finish writing that report today, finish it tomorrow morning. </p>
<p> If the Police stop your car to check your documents, don’t complain, just smile. </p>
<p> If you don’t like raw fish, don’t have lunch in a sushi bar. </p>

<p> Kenneth Beare is an English as a Second Language (ESL) teacher and course developer with over three decades of teaching experience. </p>
<p> The first and second conditional in English refer to a present or future situation. Generally, the difference between the two forms depends on whether a person believes that a situation is possible or unlikely. Often, the condition or imagined situation is ridiculous or clearly impossible, and in this case, the choice between first or second conditional is easy: We choose the second conditional. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<p> Tom currently is a full-time student. If Tom had a full-time job, he'd probably work in computer graphics. </p>
<p> In this case, Tom is a full-time student so it is obvious that he does NOT have a full-time job. He might have a part-time job, but his studies demand that he concentrates on learning. First or second conditional? </p>
<p> --> Second conditional because it is clearly impossible. </p>
<p> In other cases, we speak about a condition that clearly possible, and in this case, choosing between the first or second conditional is easy again: We choose the first conditional. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<p> Janice is coming to visit for a week in July. If the weather is good, we'll go for a hike in the park. </p>
<p> Weather is very unpredictable, but it's quite possible that the weather will be good in July. First or second conditional? </p>
<p> --> First conditional because the situation is possible. </p>
<p> First or Second Conditional Based on Opinion </p>
<p> The choice between first or second conditional is often not so clear. Sometimes, we choose the first or second conditional based on our opinion of a situation. In other words, if we feel something or someone can do something, then we'll choose the first conditional because believe it is a real possibility. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If she studies a lot, she will pass the exam. They will go on holiday if they have the time. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if we feel that a situation is not very possible or that a situation is improbable we choose the second conditional. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If she studied harder, she would pass the test. They would go away for a week if they had the time. </p>
<p> Here is another way of looking at this decision. Read the sentences with the speakers unspoken thought expressed in the parentheses. This opinion shows how the speaker decided between the first or second conditional. </p>
<p> If she studies a lot, she will pass the exam. (Jane's a good student.) </p>
<p> If he worked harder, he would pass the exam. (John doesn't take school seriously.) </p>
<p> Tom will take some time off next week if his boss says it's OK. (Tom's boss is a nice guy.) </p>
<p> Frank would take some time off next month if he could get an OK from his supervisor. (Unfortunately, his supervisor isn't very nice and there's a lot of work to be done next month.) </p>
<p> As you can see from the examples above, the choice between the first or second conditional can express someone's opinion about the situation. Remember that the first conditional is often called the 'real conditional', whereas the second conditional is often referred to as the 'unreal conditional'. In other words, the real or conditional expresses something the speaker believes could happen, and the unreal or second conditional expresses something that the speaker doesn't believe could happen. </p>

To practice conditional form structure, this real and unreal conditional form worksheet provides a quick review and practice exercises, the past conditional worksheet focuses on using the form in the past.

<p> We have handouts on tenses, conditionals, adjectives and much more! Check our main index for more info. Remember that you are allowed to make photocopies of these materials. </p>
<p> In addition, you can find a specific grammar point using our instant lookup system. Try it today! </p>
<p> This is a great worksheet to help your students build their vocabulary! </p>
<p> There are six different phrasal verbs, all themed around the word 'out'. There is a gap-fill exercise introducing the expressions, followed by a caption quiz (pictured left). </p>
<p> The lesson rounds off with discussion questions, so that your students can use the new language about themselves. </p>
<p> Our extensive collection of Phrasal Verb worksheets can be found here. </p>
<p> 'Your Last Vacation' is just one of many 'Theme Lessons' we have. We have built a number of worksheets with some common situations / topics that your students need. Lessons include: ordering at a restaurant, going to a doctor, asking questions at a bank ... and more! </p>
<p> This worksheet looks at some common expressions used when reading and talking about crime. </p>
<p> There are four different crime stories in a newspaper format, with a gap-fill exercise. </p>
<p> There are extended exercises, recycling the vocabulary and collocations. There are also discussion questions about crime. </p>
<p> The lesson rounds off with a crossword, which can also be set as homework. </p>
<p> Handouts Online has stacks of reading-based worksheets. </p>
<p> These reading-based lessons have proved a big hit with our members! They're all based around a short article on a topic which is bound to go down well in your lessons! Topics include email/spam, lotteries, the environment and more. </p>
<p> We've designed these lessons so that there are lots of opportunities for your students to express their opinions on the topic. They're great as instant lessons. </p>
<p> Movies make a great discussion topic. However, many lower-level students lack the language skills to talk about it effectively. </p>
<p> This two-page worksheet teaches some useful phrases and has info-gap exercises and speaking practice. Recommended for elementary and pre-intermediate level students. </p>
<p> We also have a British-English version called 'Talking about Films'. </p>
<p> Our worksheets have lots of speaking practice - whether it's discussion questions, information-gap exercises or pairwork. </p>
<p> Most worksheets have exercises which start off controlled, and then progress to 'production' with students personalising the target language. It's great for improving learners' accuracy and confidence with English. </p>
<p> If your students need practice of past simple irregular verbs, this could be just the ticket. This crossword is suitable for lower level students, and can be used either in the lesson, or as homework. </p>
<p> Handouts Online has a great variety of materials. We don't just have grammar worksheets. There are also crosswords, wordsearches, cards and games. </p>
<p> Members also have unrestricted access to our flashcard collection. </p>
<p> 'Looking into the Future' is a great way of building your students' abilities with more complex future tenses. </p>
<p> This worksheet has extensive practice of both the future perfect, and the future perfect continuous (progressive). </p>
<p> There's a conversation, grammar-based exercises and lots of speaking at the end. There's a choice of having a discussion, or (if you have lots of students) a 'find someone who' exercise. </p>
<p> This worksheet is designed for intermediate classes, but can easily be adjusted for other levels. </p>
<p> Handouts Online worksheets are designed so that they can be used with students of any nationality. In addition, they're great for both monolingual and multilingual classes </p>
<p> All the worksheets have notes giving a suggested teaching method. There is also an answer key to all exercises. </p>
<p> If your students have mastered the vocabulary, you could also use them for Present Simple questions and statements. Why not use them for a game of 'Guess my Job'? The possibilities are endless! </p>
<p> Handouts Online has a great selection of flashcards to help your lower-level students. They come in different sizes, and in black and white or colour. Our flashcard collection for members can be found here. </p>

<p> How to Learn English Grammar with Simple Steps </p>
<p> Tips for learning English grammar! Just because nobody taught you English and grammar in school at whatever learning level, it does not mean there is not much you can do to solve the problem. Here are some steps to learning this language and its grammar rules on your own. With these steps, you can easily rival the language and grammar skills experienced users of this language have. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> How to Learn English Grammar </p>
<p> Learn Parts of Speech </p>
<p> Each English word can be categorized into one part of speech. Therefore, understanding parts of speech is one of the key steps to learning grammar. The good thing about learning parts of speech is that you will be in a position to describe how each word in the English language can be used. </p>
<p> Here are different parts of speech. </p>
<p> Noun – a word that describes a place, thing or person, for instance, “bank”. </p>
<p> Article – they precede nouns in a sentence. They are “a”, “the”, “an”. </p>
<p> Verb – a word that describes an action, for instance, “write”. </p>
<p> Pronoun – a word that can take the place of a noun, for instance, “she”. </p>
<p> Adjective – modifies/describes a noun/pronoun, for instance, “black”. </p>
<p> Adverb – modifies a verb or an adjective, for instance, “clearly”. </p>
<p> Conjunction – joins to parts of a sentence, for example “and”. </p>
<p> Preposition – used with noun/pronoun to create a phrase that modifies other parts of speech, for example, “down”. </p>
<p> Interjection – words that illustrate an emotional state, for instance, “ouch”. </p>
<p> 9 parts of speech in English grammar </p>
<p> Learn Verb Tenses </p>
<p> There are three kinds of tenses– past, present and future. The past tenses describe things that happened before the time of reporting, while present tenses describe what is happening as the thing is happening. Finally, the future tense describes what will happen after the time the statement is being made. </p>
<p> Learn all (12) tenses in English with useful grammar rules, examples and ESL worksheets. </p>
<p> Sentences, Phrases, and Clauses </p>
<p> Sentences </p>
<p> While studying English words is great, you have to learn how to put these words together into sentences. Sentences express your complete thoughts. In general, a sentence shows someone/something doing/being something, and it consists of a subject and a verb at its most basic level. Without one of these two parts, that sentence is considered improper. </p>
<p> For instance, “Dogs can bite.” is a complete sentence, while “The excited children.” is not a proper sentence. </p>
<p> For instance, instead of having two sentences, “The doctor entered the room.” and “The doctor took the file.”, you can write, “The doctor entered the room and took the file.” </p>
<p> Phrases </p>
<p> You can think of phrases as units of language. They are a group of words, but usually not enough to form a complete sentence. There are different kinds of phrases, each of which is described based on what part of speech it helps to describe. </p>
<p> Offers additional information about a verb. These phrases are very complex. For instance, in the sentence, she will eventually have her own car, “will have” is the verb phrase. </p>
<p> Provides additional information about a preposition, for instance, “after” the exercise. </p>
<p> Clauses </p>
<p> Like phrases, clauses are also units of language. All clauses have a subject and a verb, and some are independent while others are dependent. </p>
<p> Dependent clauses act like parts of speech, as phrases do, and they cannot stand on their own as complete sentences. </p>
<p> For instance, “Although the package came, he could not open the door.” The part “he could not open the door” is an independent clause, but “although the package came’ cannot stand as a sentence and is, therefore, a dependent clause. </p>
<p> Generally, clauses are used when forming compound sentences. </p>
<p> Conditionals, Reported speech, Passive voice, Quantifiers and Determiners </p>
<p> The English language has many types of sentences. For instance, a conditional sentence demonstrates that one part of a sentence is true if the other part is true. For instance, “if it rains, the crops will grow.” </p>
<p> Reported speech is a way of writing or speaking where instead of quoting what the speaker said, you use your own words to convey their message. For instance, if the person said, “I will come”, the reported speech would be “he/she said she would come.” </p>
<p> In passive voice, the subject receives the action rather than performing it as is the case with active voice. For instance, “the cat poured the milk” is active, while “the milk was poured by the cat” is passive. </p>
<p> Generally, active voice is much preferable as it uses fewer words and makes statements less complicated and more powerful. </p>
<p> Quantifiers are used when providing information about a number relating to something. For instance, most people change jobs by age “thirty.” </p>
<p> Determiners are words or phrases that come before a noun or a noun phrase. Their role is to demonstrate its reference. For instance. There were “a few” cookies left. </p>
<p> Basic Grammar Rules: English Sentence Structure </p>
<p> We’ll look at some common elements of English sentence structure. If you find these ideas difficult, don’t worry. As your English improves, you’ll learn to recognize these patterns. And this will give you a deeper understanding of not only English, but also your own language. </p>
<p> Rule #1: A complete sentence must include a noun and a verb. </p>
<p> The bird flew. </p>
<p> Rule #2: A complete sentence must include a subject and a predicate. </p>
<p> Rule #4: Adjectives can go directly before the noun they describe, or after it, if separated by a verb. </p>
<p> The angry bird flew. </p>
<p> The bird is angry. </p>
<p> Rule #5: A compound subject includes two or more simple subjects. </p>
<p> The bird and the plane flew. </p>
<p> Rule #6: A compound predicate includes two or more predicates. </p>
<p> The bird flew and sang. </p>
<p> Rule #7: A compound sentence includes more than one subject or predicate. </p>
<p> The bird sang and the plane flew. </p>
<p> Rule #8: An independent clause consists of a subject and a predicate, like a complete sentence. </p>
<p> The plane flew. </p>
<p> Rule #9: A dependent clause cannot form a complete sentence without additional words. </p>
<p> The plane flew when the bird sang. </p>
<p> Rule #10: The direct object is the noun being acted on by the verb. </p>
<p> The bird ate seeds. </p>
<p> Rule #11: The indirect object is the noun which receives the direct object. </p>
<p> The bird gave the seeds to me. </p>
<p> Rule #12: When written in passive voice, the object of the verb becomes the subject of the sentence. </p>
<p> The bird ate seeds. </p>
<p> –> The seeds were eaten by the bird. </p>
<p> Rule #13: Conjugations of the verb “to be” are essential to passive voice. </p>
<p> The seeds are being eaten by the bird. </p>
<p> Rule #14: Sentences written in passive voice can omit the subject of the acting verb. </p>
<p> The seeds were eaten. </p>
<p> Rule #15: In passive voice, the subject of the acting verb is connected by a prepositional phrase. </p>
<p> Rule #18: A subject compliment describes the subject of the sentence. </p>
<p> The bird is green. </p>
<p> 18 Basic English Grammar Rules </p>
<p> Learn to Write Numbers and Punctuation Marks </p>
<p> When writing, there are certain rules you should follow. For instance, one-digit numbers should be spelled out, for instance, “two.” However, numbers greater than 9 should be written numerically. </p>
<p> Still, you should never mix up spelled and numerically written numbers within a sentence. For instance, “they were 10 girls and two boys” is incorrect, while “they were 10 girls and 2 boys” is correct. Additionally, you should not start sentences with a numerically written number. </p>
<p> Also, as you write fractions, you should use hyphens, for instance, “two-thirds”. Also, decimals should always be written numerically, as well as days of the month, for instance, “0.6” and “August 10”. </p>
<p> Grammar Lessons </p>
<p> There is obviously more to knowing English grammar than the steps shown above, but these basics should help you make significant progress in this important learning journey. By keeping these simple rules in mind, and trying to learn as much as possible with following grammar lessons, you can easily become a very proficient user of this language. </p>

<p> I have barely snored at all! My girlfriend was starting to put pressure on me to have an operation to stop my snoring, but to be totally honest I was scared stiff. I've heard some horror stories and there was no way I wanted to take on that risk. Then I found your website and since putting your techniques into practice I have barely snored at all. My girlfriend can't believe how effective this has been. ★★★ http://ishbv.com/snoringno/pdf </p>
<p> I am so pleased that I found you! I have suffered from Sleep Apnea for years. I have tried everything to fix the problem but nothing has worked. For the last years I have been trying to use a CPAP machine on and off but it is very difficult to sleep with. It's noisy and very uncomfortable. I had no idea there was a natural way to help me. I am so pleased that I found you! ➤➤ https://bit.ly/37PhtTN </p>
<p> CONDITIONAL SENTENCES (RULES AND EXERCISES) </p>
<p> 1. Object 1Object 2 </p>
<p> 2. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES ATC-IBARRA CONDITIONAL SENTENCESWe have 4 conditional cases: zero conditional First conditional Second conditional and Third conditional Zero conditional2 </p>
<p> 3. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES ATC-IBARRA GRAMMAR RULES WITH EXAMPLESThere are four basic types of conditional sentences in the English language.Examples:The zero conditional: I take my umbrella if it rains.The first conditional: Ill call you if I work late.The second conditional: If the bus didnt arrive on time, I would drive you to theairport.The third conditional: She wouldnt have come if I hadnt invited her.  The zero conditionalThe zero conditional describes situations that are always true. If has thesame meaning as when or whenever.Example:If I go to school, I get up at seven. (Whenever I go to school I get up at thesame time.)If you park your car on double yellow lines, you pay a fine. (Whenever youpark illegally, you pay a fine.)We use the present simple tense in both the main clauses and the ifclauses.  The first conditionalThe first conditional sentences are usedto speculate about possible situations thatcan really happen at present or in future.We do not use will in an if clause todescribe future activities (compare it to time clauses).Examples:If he studies hard, hell pass the exams. If we catch the 10.15 train, we will arrive on time. If you dont get the ticket, what will you do?3 </p>
<p> 4. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES ATC-IBARRAWe make if clauses with if + present tense and main clauses with will +bare infinitive.  The second conditionalIn the second conditional sentences we speculate about situations that willprobably never happen at present or in future.Example:If I had more time, I would help you. (But I am not free at the moment. I canthelp you).If I won a million dollars, I would start a business of my own. (But I know that itis not realistic.)We make if clauses with if + past tense and main clauses with would +bare infinitive.Note: the verb to be can be specific in the if clause.If I were rich, I wouldnt work.If he were younger, he would marry her.(But was is also possible: If I was rich, I wouldnt work.If he was younger, he would marry her.)But: If I were you, I wouldnt do it. (In this expression, were is much more usualthan was.)  Compare the first conditional with the secondThe main difference between the first conditional and the second conditional isabout probability: the first conditional is realistic, the second conditional isunrealistic.Sometimes we can use both with the following difference in meaning.If I see him, I will tell him. (I suppose I will see him, because we go to thesame school.)If I saw him, I would tell him. (I dont think I will see him, because he is ill.)If I need your help, Ill call you. (It is probable that I will need your help.)If I needed your help, Id call you. (It is not very probable that I will need yourhelp.)Sometimes we must use either the first conditional or the second conditional4 </p>
<p> 5. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES ATC-IBARRAto make it clear that the situation is real or unreal.If you get up late, you will miss your bus. (a real situation)If I came from your country, I would understand your problems. (an unrealsituation - I am not from your country.)  Other formsApart from the basic structures (if+ the present simple + will and if + the pastsimple + would), we can also make different combinations.Examples - type 1:If you have finished your dinner, you can ask for the bill.If you are feeling tired, take a rest:If he is a good skier, he might make it.If you want to be slim, you should eat less.If you meet her, could you let me know?Examples - type 2:If I knew his address, I might go and see him.If we were on holiday, we would be lying on a beach now.Why are we watching this film? If we were watching the news, it would bemore interesting.  The third conditionalThe third conditional sentences always refer to the past. We speculate aboutsituations that happened or did not happen in the past.Examples:If I had won a million, I would have started a business of my own. (But I didntwin anything.)If he had met her, he would have told her. (Unfortunately, he didnt meet her.)If we hadnt practised, we wouldnt have won the match. (But we practised andwon.)We make if clauses with if+ past perfect and main clauses with would + perfectinfinitive (have + past participle).But we can also combine other verb structures in third conditional sentences.We didnt save any money. If we had saved some money, we might havebought the house.5 </p>
<p> 6. CONDITIONAL SENTENCES ATC-IBARRAShe wasnt there and I wasnt sitting next to her. But if she had been there, Iwould have been sitting next to herI was looking at the trees when I fell off the bike. If I hadnt been looking at thetrees, I wouldn t have fallen off the bike.  The mixed conditionalsIn the mixed conditional sentences we can combine the second and thirdconditional.If he had left immediately, he would be here now. (He didnt leave immediatelyand isnt here.)If I had studied hard when I was young, I wouldnt be a porter now. (I didntstudy and I am a porter.)If we hadnt told him the way while he was preparing for his journey, he wouldget lost now. (We told him and he isnt lost.)  The inverted conditionalsWe can also make conditional sentences by changing the word order in the ifclause.Had he booked the hotel room, he woulnt have slept at the camp. (If he hadbooked ... )Were I in your position, I would accept it. (If I were ... )This is less common, quite formal and is mostly used in writing.NoteIf is the most frequent expression in the if clauses, but other expressions arealso possible.even if, provided (that), unless, on condition (that), in caseExamplesYou will leave tonight even if you dont want to.You can have your birthday party provided that you arent noisy.Well sell you the ranch on condition you pay in cash.You should take a dictionary with you in case you forgot some words.Unless you do something, she wont come back. (If you dont do anything, ... )6 </p>

<p> 1. Learn Vocabulary - Learn some new vocabulary before you start the lesson. </p>
<p> 2. Read and Prepare - Read the introduction and prepare to hear the audio. </p>
<p> As fun as it is to travel and see new places, it can also be stressful. Finding the perfect hotel is one way to cut down on the stress. It’s nice to have a comfortable room to come home to at the end of a long day of sightseeing. </p>
<p> But the perfect hotel often doesn’t come at the perfect price. In fact, paying for a place to sleep can destroy your travel budget if you aren’t careful. Find out what Mason and Jason look for in a hotel. </p>
<p> Dialog </p>
<p> 1. Listen and Read - Listen to the audio and read the dialog at the same time. </p>
<p> 2. Study - Read the dialog again to see how the vocab words are used. </p>
<p> Mason: You travel every now and again, right, for your band, right, Jason? </p>
<p> Jason: Yeah, and other things. English, baby!, etc. </p>
<p> Mason: Where do you find you stay most of the time? </p>
<p> Jason: It’s really random. Sometimes I stay in the cheapest place, like if it’s in a major city, especially, I’ll end up staying, like in Los Angeles, in some out-of-the-way neighborhood. </p>
<p> Mason: So I’ve done things both ways, like I’ve gotten to go on business travel where I stay at super nice places ‘cause I’m not paying for it. But then if I’m traveling, we stay in hostels, still. But we want the private room, you know, it’s not like total $15 for a bunk bed kind of thing. </p>
<p> Jason: Shared bathroom? </p>
<p> Mason: Shared bathroom, for sure. But it’s also like, I’m not paying to go on vacation to stay in my hotel. I’m paying to just be somewhere. </p>
<p> Jason: Right. Although occasionally you do find a hotel on vacation that might be worth paying for. Like there was this hotel in Spain that was in this old house, and I was like, “Let’s stay there.” And it was totally worth it, just to feel like you were in the 19th century in the Spanish countryside. </p>
<p> Mason: Yeah. So what other things do you think are worth splurging on when it comes to your hotels? </p>
<p> Jason: Possibly location. It might be worth it to stay in the middle of town. And you can’t have a bed that’s too bad. Recently, staying at a hotel made me realize I need a new bed at my house. I was just like, “This is more comfortable than home!” </p>
<p> The iTEP® test </p>
<p> Discussion </p>
<p> Mason asks Jason where he likes to stay when he travels. Jason says that he stays in different places depending on where he goes. When he visits big cities like Los Angeles, he typically stays in the cheapest place he can find, because big cities are often expensive. </p>
<p> When Mason travels for business, he gets to stay in nice hotels. But when he travels on his own, he typically stays in a cheap hotel or hostel. He likes to get a private room, but he doesn’t mind sharing a bathroom. He thinks that it doesn’t matter very much where he stays, because he doesn’t spend a lot of time in his hotel room when he is on vacation. </p>
<p> Jason says that the most important thing to him when looking for a hotel is its location. He also likes hotels with historic atmosphere. </p>
<p> Where do you usually stay when you travel? Describe your idea of the perfect hotel. </p>
<p> Comments </p>
<p> for me, i always come outside with my friends and then in the night, we get a hotel room, because we usually not stay visiting near my house for the common sightseeing. sometimes we get the private large room, but not very often, coz y’know, it cost always very much, almost of the time, we share the room with the double beds, it is cool, when coming to bed, we can also chat with each other and plan for the details of tomorrow where we should go, and what a nice place we’ve visited today. </p>
<p> If I visit foreign country for my first time, I will stay at a comfortable hotel in a safe place. </p>
<p> When I visit again, I will stay at a cheap hostel to talk with other tourists. </p>
<p> i use to stay the specialy places like beaches , hotels, and etc , there is a time that i travelled to los angels , i found a good friend called : JOHN , he wellcomes me as his brother , i visit many places that has attracted me when i get them , </p>
<p> am working at a hotel, good location, fantastic food, of course, guest rooms are also impressive. everyting in the room is high qulity. elegant environment, thoutful service always make guest returned again. if you have interesting, come to our hotel and enjoy your time. </p>
<p> while travelling i prefer to book a unexpensive hotel,for it could be my temporary home,and that will make me comfortable. </p>
<p> I like staying in big resorts because they are very convenient, comfortable, and relaxing. i don’t go to hotels or hostel because the meaning of vacation to me is not the sightseeing, it’s the resorts. I spend most of my time in the resort, swimming, eating an ice cream bar or drinking milkshakes, watching tv, or sleeping, but I never rent any other thing. </p>
<p> I love traveling so muchhh..and of course place (hotel) is the most important factor that makes my trip perfect. traveling always leaves in my mind a huge attraction that i determine it as the final end of my current study…working in a luxury hotel or resort is my biggest dream, and i’ll try all my best to reach my purpose, as well as make my dream come true :) </p>
<p> I don’t like hotels of any kinds. East or West, home is best.:) </p>
<p> But if it’s necessary to live in the hotel, it’s okay for me, but not for long. I don’t feel comfortable sleeping in somebody else`s bed. </p>
<p> My vacation have started but I don’t want to go any where. U know in vaccations, I was going to visit to my grand parents. But, now they have shifted to another country, and I can’t go to that country. because I don’t have enough money to go there. last year I had stayed in hotel, and had a good experience b’coz the hotel was so nice…. </p>
<p> I myself like staying in affordable places, because it think although my place is a improtant factor of my vacation however save money for other stuff.But my family beleive that “If you want to have a good travel you should better to spend more money to upgrade your options and make a higher level of satisfaction for yourself in limit period of time” </p>
<p> But I think choosing the way for spending money in travel depens on you point of veiw and culture </p>
<p> I think hotels must be comfortable and tidy.Moreover,can give pleasure.So that some people who want to relax can be convenient and diverting. </p>
<p> in my holiday . the amazing hotel i see ever in my life is mazagan betwen casablanca and jadida . it was so awsome . i spend there amzing time inside and outside room in hotel . but the most important to me is with who you are in this vacation . familly its means every thing to me i spend with them amzing time and we enjoyyyyyyyyy in hotel mazagan. </p>
<p> I seldom travelling, but If I had to go somewhere on a vacation I would prefer a nice places with good location, like Jason has said it doesn’t matter to stay in a hostel because we spend most of our times outside the room, that’s why location is much more important than the place we stay at night. </p>
<p> The hotel must be well placed and comfortable.Generally I chose comfortable hotels even if they don’t have a good location. </p>
<p> I don’t like shared bathroom.I don’t feel comfortable. </p>
<p> And also I don’t like bathtubes in the wardrobe.There are some traditional hotels where traditionally the bathtube is in the wardrobe.One time I stayed for 3 nights and I didn’t have shower.It’s not comfortable at all. </p>
<p> for me the stressful is where the hotels is far a way from the beach and supermarket and the centre contry to .. the bast summer is if your windows opning early front of the sound of wave and birth sea .. </p>
<p> I never visited any country or somewhere But If you ask me where do you prefer stay , I prefer stay near the beach specially at morning the scene sunset I . </p>
<p> I can’t Imagine any vacation without hotel , from the other hand the enjoyment only when you go out alone ,Nobody with you , try to recognize about the culture depending on yourself , got on new ideas about what others people do everyday . </p>
<p> As we know the travel needs lots of money , there’s a big difference If you want to resident in the hotel or you want to resident in anywhere , you should have lots of money , because you are a tourist , you aren’t orginal citizen. </p>

<doc id="file15566493" filename="how-to-use-conditionals-in-english-zero-first-second-third-and-mixed" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.wallstreetenglish.com/blog/how-to-use-conditionals-in-english-zero-first-second-third-and-mixed/">
<p> Search </p>
<p> How to use conditionals in English: zero, first, second, third and mixed. </p>
<p> Making conditional sentences is an everyday part of your native language, and introducing them to your English conversation can really improve your level of communication. There are four conditionals in total and you will learn to use them gradually, obviously starting with the most basic ones – the zero and first conditional. To have a general idea of how all the conditionals work, take a look at this overview so you can start to get an idea of what they are and when we use them. </p>
<p> What is a Conditional Sentence? </p>
<p> A conditional sentence is based on the word ‘if’. There are always two parts to a conditional sentence – one part beginning with ‘if’ to describe a possible situation, and the second part which describes the consequence. For example: </p>
<p> If it rains, we’ll get wet. </p>
<p> We can also invert the two parts of a conditional sentence so that the ‘if’ part comes second, and this is especially common in questions. For example: </p>
<p> What will you do if you miss the train? </p>
<p> How can you finish the project if you don’t have a computer? </p>
<p> 0 – The zero conditional </p>
<p> 1 – The first conditional </p>
<p> It is also possible to mix the second and third conditional. Let’s look at each conditional to see how we use them. </p>
<p> The Zero Conditional </p>
<p> We use the zero conditional to talk about permanent truths, such as scientific facts, and general habits. The structure is simple: </p>
<p> Here are some examples: </p>
<p> If you heat water to 100°, it boils. </p>
<p> If you eat a lot, you put on weight. </p>
<p> If it doesn’t rain for a long time, the earth gets very dry. </p>
<p> If we go out with friends, we normally go to a restaurant. </p>
<p> If I’m tired, I go to bed early. </p>
<p> The First Conditional </p>
<p> We use the first conditional to talk about a realistic situation in the present or future. The structure of the first conditional is as follows: </p>
<p> Another way to make first conditional sentences is to use ‘unless’ which means ‘only if’ or ‘except’. As with ‘if’, the word ‘unless’ can never be followed by ‘will’ but only by the present simple. For example: </p>
<p> Unless you hurry up, you won’t catch the bus. </p>
<p> I’ll carry on doing this work, unless my boss tells me to do something else. </p>
<p> We’ll stay at home unless the weather improves. </p>
<p> The Second Conditional </p>
<p> We use the second conditional to talk about improbable or impossible situations in the present or future. Here is the structure: </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<p> If I had more time, I’d exercise more. (But I don’t have more time so I don’t.) </p>
<p> If I were rich, I’d spend all my time travelling. (But I’m not rich so I can’t.) </p>
<p> If she saw a snake, she’d be terrified. </p>
<p> If he didn’t have to work late, he could go out with his girlfriend. </p>
<p> What would you do if you were offered a job in Canada? </p>
<p> You wouldn’t have to walk everywhere if you bought a bike. </p>
<p> A common expression used to give advice has the second conditional structure. The expression is ‘If I were you, I’d..’, meaning ‘in your situation, this is what I would do’. For example: </p>
<p> B: If I were you, I’d take an aspirin. </p>
<p> A: I don’t understand this. </p>
<p> B: If I were you, I’d ask your teacher for help. </p>
<p> B: If I were you, I’d phone the customer to let them know. </p>
<p> The Third Conditional </p>
<p> We use the third conditional to talk about impossible situations, as in the second conditional, in the past. We often use the third conditional to describe regrets. The structure is: </p>
<p> Here are some examples: </p>
<p> If we had left earlier, we would have arrived on time. </p>
<p> If you hadn’t forgotten her birthday, she wouldn’t have been upset. </p>
<p> If they had booked earlier, they could have found better seats. </p>

<p> Mixed Conditionals </p>
<p> It’s possible to combine the second and third conditional in one sentence when we want to make a hypothesis about the past that has a consequence in the present. In this case, the structure is: </p>
<p> Here are some examples: </p>
<p> If you’d studied harder, you’d be at a higher level now. </p>

<p> How to Use the Conditional "Should" </p>
<p> Is it easy to learn the conditional mood in English? If only! </p>
<p> After English students learn the four types of conditionals with if-clauses and figure out when to use each one, they are told that there are other words and patterns to indicate the conditional mood, such as unless, even if, and should. </p>
<p> Students often struggle with the conditional should (also called should-inversion) for a few reasons. First, the pattern differs from other conditional patterns, and second, the meaning is unrelated to should as a modal of advice. It is also quite formal, so students don’t come across it all that often. </p>
<p> But much like any grammar target in English, the conditional should can be explained and learned fairly painlessly using patterns and examples. </p>
<p> Meanings </p>
<p> Conditional should and modal should have very different meanings. </p>
<p> Students first learn that should is a modal of advice. The meaning of modal should is a suggestion. </p>
<p> You should pay attention in class. (I suggest that you pay attention in class.) </p>
<p> Conditional should means if and is used for hypothetical situations. </p>
<p> Should you need anything else, please call this number. (If you need anything else, please call this number.) </p>
<p> Patterns </p>
<p> Conditional should and modal should have different patterns in English. </p>
<p> Modal should follows the typical S-V-O sentence pattern: </p>
<p> subject + modal + base verb </p>
<p> Conditional should has inversion in the sentence, which means that the subject and verb are switched. This is confusing for students because although inversion is common in questions, it rarely occurs in sentences. </p>
<p> Should I happen to call after hours, is it possible to leave a message? </p>
<p> The patterns for conditional if and should are fairly similar, but note that if-clauses follow normal tense conjugation patterns with -s, -ed, etc., whereas conditional should takes a base verb (as modals always do). </p>
<p> Examples & Usage </p>
<p> The conditional should is a formal expression that we don’t use in speaking too often. It is more common to see in written form, such as in guidelines or regulations, on signs, or in legal documents. </p>
<p> Should anything happen, call this number. </p>
<p> Should the computer lock you out, try resetting the password. </p>
<p> Should you fail to comply with these regulations, you will be banned from the organization. </p>
<p> Should we be unable to reach our goal, we will try again next year. </p>
<p> The conditional should is most often used in place of the zero or first conditional. Remind your learners that the zero conditional is used for true facts or repeated actions, and the main clause is formed with a simple present verb. The first conditional is used when an outcome is likely or possible, and the main clause is usually formed with will + base verb. </p>
<p> If no one answers, please call back tomorrow. </p>
<p> Should no one answer, please call back tomorrow. </p>
<p> If I pass the test, I will graduate. </p>
<p> Should I pass the test, I will graduate. </p>
<p> It is possible, though not common, to use the conditional should in place of the second conditional when an outcome is unlikely or impossible. The main clause is usually formed with would + base verb. Remind students that the verb following conditional should must be a base verb (not a past verb). </p>
<p> If I were rich, I would travel around the world. </p>
<p> Should I become rich, I would travel around the world. </p>

<p> I am a HUGE fan of this lesson, which rightly dispels misguided and condescending fear on the part of narrow minded ESL instructors of teaching the conditional Should with inversion. It is extremely common in literature, and since literature is a fundamental part of meaningful engagement in a language, training students to comprehend it, as well as the myriad contexts in which formal English is still the norm (legal contexts, advisory notices, official positions or simply formally disposed speech styles) opens doors to language learners and improves job prospects, since uses of such structures set aside the viable candidate from the passable one, especially in positions where public communication is integral to the role (even an administrative assistant must master these forms to advance pay grades). 100 thumbs up for the organization of the lesson...teaching should as a modal of advice first and then getting into conditional declarative uses. I will closely follow this scheme (though I'll substitute more colourful usage examples) in my own lessons on conditional structures. </p>

<p> Hi Caleb, </p>
<p> Thanks a lot for your message! I'm happy to hear you found this post useful. I think that it's great to expose higher-level students to all the structures they will see in the language. Some teachers might just be wondering when the correct time to do so is (so as not to overwhelm lower-level students with complicated constructions that they won't see at those levels). </p>

<p> I was highly appreciative of this excellent lesson on the use of should as a conditional marker in conditional sentences using subject verb inversion. </p>
<p> All to often, ESL teachers exaggerate the difficulty of the use of were, should and had in SV inverted constructions of conditional sentences and, in my opinion, greatly underestimate the learning capacity of their students in so doing -- not to mention the consequences of closing doors of comprehension on a form that is ubiquitous in literary works, newspaper articles (NYT opeds frequently deploy advanced vocabulary and formal grammatical constructions), journals, legal documents, advisory notices from businesses to customers, employees or tenants, a large variety of professional communication in so standard a phrase as 'should you have any further concerns, do not hesitate to contact our offices, [hours of operation or contact info],' and last but not least, persons of a formal, academic or professional bent who regularly or in certain key settings deploy these structures in speech. </p>
<p> The particular organization of this lesson, firmly establishing the use of should as a modal of suggestion/advice/obligation before moving on to the conditional usage of should, is one I find particularly effective. I especially like the inclusion of interrogative (question) sentence examples and negative statements. In my own lessons on conditional sentences, I plan to follow this organization...though I can't decide if it would be good to group had, were and should together in a single unit on SV inversion in conditional sentences. Any advice on that idea would be appreciated. </p>
<p> I also think it's very important for higher level intermediate students, and adult learners trying to improve writing skills, to also learn the effect of register that the use of these forms has in relation to other constructions (such as non-inverted SV conditional sentences using 'if'). </p>

<p> Thanks again, Caleb. It's great to have a list of places that you'd commonly see the conditional should in context, so thank you for listing those in your second paragraph. I think adding had and were to the mix and teaching them alongside should (for conditional sentences with S-V inversion) is a great idea for higher-level students. I'm a firm believer in presenting related things at once so that students can see the bigger picture. In my experience, it provides a greater understanding of the patterns etc. (You'll see I advocate for presenting all four conditional 'if' patterns at once in my post on Conditionals: https://blog.esllibrary.com/2013/03/14/an-easy-way-to-teach-conditionals/). Thanks again for taking the time to comment! Best of luck with your lesson. </p>

<p> Although it is grammatically possible, for a conditional marker, I suggest using 'if' instead of 'should,' because 'if' is immediately understood as a conditional, whereas with 'should' the reader or listener doesn't know what was meant until the end of the clause after the comma. It requires a moment to process. </p>
<p> With oral consumption, we want the audience to understand, left-to-right, without having to retain or return to the start of the sentence to understand the intended meaning. </p>

<p> Hi Craig, </p>
<p> I agree! The conditional should is quite formal and not heard very often. We should encourage our students to use 'if' when speaking and writing, though we do need to introduce the conditional should to higher-level learners in case they come across it. </p>

<p> Hi, Tanya! Thank you for this lesson. I have one question though. Is it right to use a conditional should in the second part of a sentence instead of first (as provided in examples above)? Namely, is the following sentence correct: 'Let me know should you have any questions'? Many thanks! Mariya </p>

<p> Hi Mariya, </p>
<p> Great question! I would say that using the conditional should in the second part of the sentence is best avoided because it's usually not common/correct. I wouldn't use 'should' with 'let me know,' for example. However, in some formal cases, it is possible (e.g., 'Please inform your manager should any problems arise.'). </p>
<p> Wonderful information! Please consider putting this in an easy to print format. I would love to have this with me as a reference and I also would welcome using it with my advanced students. I work with adult English Language Learners who are either employed or looking for employment. </p>

<p> Great lesson. Conditional sentence is one of grammar horror in my student days back then. I'm an Indonesian and English isn't familiar for us compare to our neighbors Singapore and Malaysia. Understanding conditional sentence needs higher level of culture understanding and it even getting worse should we incorporate the simplicity of conditional sentence in Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language). </p>
<p> Regarding this, I want to ask you about the right way of constructing conditional sentence using should. </p>
<p> We can still enjoy our daily life should we be able to keep the enemy at bay. </p>
<p> Is the main claus and the conditional clause constructed rightly? Should aforementioned example is not correct, what is the correct one for main clause and/or conditional clause? </p>

<p> Hi Slamet, your sentence is correct! I agree that grammar targets that don't translate directly into one's native language are very difficult. This post and chart on conditionals might also help you: https://esllibrary.com/blog/an-easy-way-to-teach-conditionals </p>

<p> JOURNEY, TRAVEL OR TRIP? </p>
<p> THE WORDS TRAVEL, TRIP AND JOURNEY ARE USUALLY VERY CONFUSING FOR SPANISH STUDENTS OF ENGLISH, </p>
<p> LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE MEANING AND USE OF THESE WORDS. </p>
<p> Trip (n.) </p>
<p> The act of going to another place (often for a short period of time) and returning. </p>
<p> We took a five-day trip to the Amazon. </p>
<p> You’re back from vacation! How was your trip? </p>
<p> I went on business trips to Switzerland and Germany last month. </p>
<p> Use the verbs “take” and “go on” with trip. </p>
<p> A round-trip ticket is a ticket for going and coming back. </p>
<p> Travel (v.) </p>
<p> My sister is currently traveling through South America. </p>
<p> Travel (n.) can be used to describe the act of traveling in general: </p>
<p> Travel in that region of the country is dangerous. </p>
<p> World travel gives you a new perspective. </p>
<p> Incorrect uses of travel: </p>
<p> How was your travel? How was your trip? </p>
<p> I’m planning a travel to the U.S. next year. I’m planning to travel to the U.S. next year. I’m planning a trip to the U.S. next year. </p>
<p> Journey (n.) </p>
<p> One piece of travel (going from one place to another) – usually a long distance. </p>
<p> The journey takes 3 hours by plane or 28 hours by bus. </p>
<p> He made the 200-mile journey by bike. </p>
<p> “A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step” – Lao-tze, Tao Te Ching </p>
<p> We can also use journey in a more “metaphorical” way to talk about progress in life: </p>
<p> He has overcome a lot of problems on his spiritual journey. </p>
<p> My uncle is an alcoholic, but he’s beginning the journey of recovery. </p>

<p> Phrasal verbs - travel </p>
<p> Phrasal verbs, or multi-word verbs, are verbs that are combined with one or two particles (a preposition or adverb), for example, 'over' or 'under', to make verbs with new meanings. These new meanings are usually non-literal. For example, to turn means to change direction (he turned to look at her) but to turn something down means to reject or say 'no' to something (the Matron said she was going to have to turn down Alice's request for a transfer). You can organise how you learn and record phrasal verbs by grouping them together by common verb (come in, come over, come to), by common particle (turn up, show up, break up) or around a theme (travel, relationships, money). Here are some phrasal verbs about travel. </p>
<p> Phrasal verbs - travel </p>
<p> get away (from someone or somewhere) leave or escape from a person or place, often when it is difficult to do this Matron asked Alice why she wanted to get away from the children's ward all of a sudden. I didn't think I was every going to get away. He just wouldn't stop talking to me! back up vehicles have to wait in a long line because there are too many of them The traffic has started to back up because of the accident. Road works have caused a lot of delays and cars are backing up along the mains roads into the city. get on (a vehicle) go onto a bus, train, plane or boat We got on the train at 9 o'clock but it didn't leave until 9.30. He got on the bus and then realised he'd left his wallet at home. hop on (informal) go onto a bus, train, plane or boat With a one-day travel card you can hop on and off as many busses as you like. Just hop on the 172 and you'll be in the city in 10 minutes. get off (a vehicle) leave a train, bus plane or boat Get off at the bus stop after the cinema and I'll meet you there. We got off the ship for a few days and spent the time at the beach. </p>
<p> check in show your ticket at an airport to confirm that you are flying a particular flight and so that your bags can be put on the plane We need to check in two hours before the flight. You can't go through to passport control until you have checked in. pull over (a vehicle) / pull someone (a driver) over a vehicle moves to the side of the road and stops Just pull over by the petrol station, and I'll run in and buy us some chocolate. The Police pulled him over because he was speeding. pull out (a vehicle) move onto a road where the traffic is moving faster He just pulled out without even signalling. I almost crashed right into him. Wait until there's a break in the traffic and then pull out. stop over (verb) a stopover (noun) stay at a place for one night or a few nights on the way to somewhere else They stopped over in Singapore for one night on the way to Australia.

<p> Hello, it’s Friday today and I’m thinking about what I’m going to do at the weekend, but because of the British weather it’s really difficult to make plans. I’d like to go for a long walk in the country tomorrow, but what if it rains? I won’t feel like going for a walk in the pouring rain, will I? So I’d better think of something else that I could do tomorrow if it rains. I don’t know. Well, there’s a good exhibition on at the Royal Academy, I could go there. In fact that’s a good idea, so if it’s a nice day tomorrow I’ll go for a long walk, but if it rains I’ll go to the exhibition. So that’s the day planned, but what about the evening? Well again that depends. If there’s something good on at the cinema, I’ll go and see a film, but if there isn’t, I think I’ll stop at home and watch TV. What about you? Have you got any plans for the weekend? </p>

<p> This EFL lesson is based on three simple, minute-long short films directed by Rick Mereki, each revolving around a theme (travel, learning and food) and all three compiled from video taken on an epic trip of 11 countries in 44 days. </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Write the following questions on the board? </p>
<p> If you could travel to 11 countries in 44 days, which countries would you visit? </p>
<p> What would you do in each country? </p>
<p> Get your students to work in small groups, answer the questions and talk about what their epic trip would involve. </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Tell your students they are going to watch a short one-minute called MOVE which shows clips of 11 countries visited by Andrew Lees in 44 days. Students should watch the film and try to name as many of the countries as possible. The clips are very fast, so it will be necessary to watch the film at least twice. </p>
<p> The countries are Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Brazil, USA, Burma, and Thailand. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Ask your students to discuss the following questions in pairs: </p>
<p> Have you been to these of these countrie? </p>
<p> Would you like to go to any of these countries? </p>
<p> What are they famous for? </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Ask your students to discuss in small groups what you could learn to do in each of the countries. For example, you could learn to dance tango in Argentina or you could learn to make paella in Spain. </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Tell your students they are going to watch the second film LEARN in which Andrew learns different things in each country. Students should watch the film and spot which things he learns, and then compare them with their answers in the previous step. </p>
<p> Get feedback from your students and ask them which of the things they would most like to learn to do. </p>
<p> Step 6 </p>
<p> Ask students what foods and dishes are typical in the 11 countries in MOVE and LEARN. Ask what ingredients are used in the dishes. </p>
<p> Step 7 </p>
<p> Tell students they are going to watch the third film EAT in which Andrew tries typical dishes in each country. Ask your students to identify the dishes and ingredients. </p>
<p> Get feedback from your students and then watch the film a second time. </p>
<p> Homework </p>
<p> Ask your students to write a composition about what their own epic journey would be using their ideas in Step 1. They should write three paragraphs: one about where they would go and why, the second about what they would learn in each country and the third about what they would eat and drink. </p>

<p> I love this idea and think it’s a great way of teaching students. Just one question – where did you take the films from? They don’t open in Mozilla Firefox. I can only watch the food landscapes. Would be really great if you could drop me a hint.XYours, Claudia </p>
<p> Hi Claudia, Thanks a lot. I’ve just checked and I could watch the videos with Firefox. I imagine it was just a temporary problem with firefox, but if you still can’t see them, here’s a link to Vimeo: </p>
<p> I recently came across your website having seen the rave reviews on the BBC’s Teaching English site. I am based in China and cannot access youtube, or Vimeo, or the majority of the videos/films – over here we mainly have access to YouKu or TuDou, I was wondering if you know of any other sites that will play the videos and I can give them a try. </p>
<p> What you are doing is awesome, and I’m really looking forward to introducing my students to your lesson plans – particularly in my ‘experimental’ classes. </p>
<p> Dear James, Your comments are very kind, I really appreciate them. </p>
<p> I’m sorry, but I don’t know of any sites where you could see the films in China. However, if you could get somebody to download the films for you using software such as Clip Nabber,http://clipnabber.com/, they could send you the films or upload them to a cloud such as dropbox, http://dropbox., you could download them and then put them on a pendrive, and then show them to your students. That’s the only solution I can think of, Ihope it works and that your students can gt to see them. Let me know how it goes. </p>

<p> Past Continuous - Rules and exercises for intermediate level </p>
<p> Example of past continuous: I wasn't working This image is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license </p>
<p> An overview of the past continuous tense with a clear explanation and exercises. This online lesson in English grammar is designed for intermediate level students </p>
<p> Form of past continuous </p>
<p> The past continuous is used to express and action or a state that was happening at the time of the speaking. The action was not finished. </p>
<p> Past continuous: positive and negative </p>
<p> Past continuous: question </p>
<p> Past continuous: be careful! </p>
<p> 1. All continuous verbs forms are composed of the auxiliary verb 'be' plus the gerund (-ing ) of the main verb. 2. We use the continuous only for verbs which describe actions. 3. Note that for questions is not necessary to use 'do' because there is already an auxiliary verb 'be'. </p>
<p> Uses of the past continuous </p>
<p> The past continuous is used: </p>
<p> 1) for describing the situation or background to a story, or actions in progress. </p>
<p> The band was playing and the waiters were serving the VIP's who where sitting at their tables. </p>
<p> 2) to express activity in progress before and after a particular time in the past. </p>
<p> At 6 o'clock yesterday evening they were having a meeting at the Hilton hotel. </p>
<p> 3) to express an incomplete activity in the past. </p>
<p> While on my train journey to Rome I was reading an interesting book about the cosmos. (I didn't finish the book.) </p>
<p> 4) to express an action done repeatedly. </p>
<p> He was banging on the door to wake me up. </p>
<p> 5) to show duration and is often used with other tenses. (past simple and past continuous) </p>
<p> She was writing a letter when her mother entered the room. </p>
<p> While they were walking up the mountain there was a tremendous wind blowing. </p>

<p> Phrasal Verbs Practice #1 – Travelling </p>
<p> This is the first in a series of reading activities to practice phrasal verbs. I’ll be sharing my thoughts on the importance of travelling to broaden the mind, and including great phrasal verb vocabulary to help you learn better English at the same time. Enjoy! </p>
<p> One of the most important things I do in a first English class with a student is to ask about their passions and hobbies. I would say that around 50% of them express a passion for travelling. When I ask why, they seem to find it difficult to give me a clear answer. So it got me thinking about why I travel too. I frequently set off on journeys to new places, knowing that it’s what I enjoy, but without really understanding why I enjoy it. </p>
<p> The most obvious answer is that I get to see cool places, and check out the sights in exciting and exotic parts of the world. Seeing amazing animals in the Serengeti of Tanzania is appealing because they’re the dreams of my childhood come true. Watching the Lion King on repeat as a kid, of course I always wanted to see zebras and hyenas in the wild, and travelling gave me access to those dreams. </p>
<p> But that can’t be all; if we dream of other more interesting places, then it’s probably because something is wrong with what we already have, we are incomplete in some way. So in a sense, the goal of travelling may not be to realize dreams, but to escape from our realities at home. </p>
<p> Obviously, part of the enjoyment for me is simply getting away from the life I already have. I lived in England for the best part of twenty years of my life, and started to feel that I was fairly unsurprised by the everyday happenings around me. Not that I dislike my birthplace, but I would frequently feel that if I wanted to grow as a person and have fresh perspectives on my own world, I would have to see things from another side. </p>
<p> As a child, I was fortunate enough to travel to India with my parents. Living in London, I had of course seen and met many south Asian immigrants growing up, but had always viewed them from a distance without really understanding their way of life, their mannerisms. After riding in noisy tuc-tucs in Delhi, seeing the daily hustle and bustle of Udaipur, the astronomical wonders of sun-dials in Jantar Mantar, smelling the scents of a cooking class in Jaipur, and feeling welcomed by the warmth of the people across Rajasthan, I returned to England with a new respect for these people. I felt for the first time that we shared something, that in some way we had seen some of the same things, and I could understand a little bit about their background and customs through my own experiences. I saw that travelling could bring me closer to humanity. </p>
<p> However, I’m still unsatisfied with this answer. When you check in at an airport on your way to your flight, the moment you take off, and look at the world below you, unless you’re heading to a package deal beach resort holiday, you don’t have a clue what you’re going to experience when you get to your location. You don’t know that this next journey is going to take you closer to your fellow human, it might even make you question humanity altogether. </p>
<p> So that’s why I think the true spirit of travel is not to find something we are looking for, but to find something we didn’t know we were looking for. When I travel, I don’t know what I’m going to find, how I’m going to feel, and what effect it’s going to have on me. When I’m at home, I can predict how my day will pan out, and opportunities to learn something incredible about the world are scarce. The most exciting surprises at home these days seem to come by way of election results and referendums, which teach us only about the levels of fear of the outside and the unknown that exist within our borders. Travel puts you face to face with the unknown, so that you can at least attempt to understand it, and not run in fear. </p>
<p> Check in – arrive and register at a hotel or airport </p>
<p> Take off – A plane leaving the ground into the sky </p>
<p> Others </p>
<p> Head to – Move in the direction of </p>
<p> Package deal – a holiday organized by a travel agent, with arrangements for transportation, accommodations, etc. </p>
<p> Borders – a line separating countries or areas </p>
<p> Extra Vocabulary </p>
<p> Broaden the mind – Expand one’s knowledge and opportunities </p>
<p> Hustle and bustle – A large amount of activity, usually in a noisy area like a city </p>

<p> When you take up this offer we will extend you a warm welcome. </p>
<p> I know that 'when' can replace 'if' in a zero conditional but can it be used in first conditional? Is the sentence above a second conditional? </p>
<p> Can someone explain me what is going on with the 'when'? </p>
<p> DjxCan someone explain me what is going on with the 'when'? </p>
<p> When just specifies a time condition; "if" specifies a yes-no condition. </p>
<p> When you take up this offer we will extend you a warm welcome. eg. At 6 pm you take up the offer, and we extend you a warm welcome. </p>
<p> DjxI know that 'when' can replace 'if' in a zero conditional but can it be used in first conditional? </p>
<p> Personally, I don't regard "when" as capable of forming a conditional of any kind, even though the sequence of tenses may be the same or similar. </p>
<p> DjxIs the sentence above a second conditional? </p>
<p> So no, I don't consider it a second conditional. In fact, even if you changed "when" to "if" you would still not have a second conditional. You would have a first conditional. </p>
<p> DjxCan someone explain me what is going on with the 'when'? </p>
<p> "when" introduces a subordinate clause of time. At the time that you take up this offer (presumably in the future), we will extend you a warm welcome. The main clause about welcoming you is more or less a promise of what will be done at a certain time. </p>

<p> Second Conditional </p>
<p> English Grammar </p>
<p> When we are thinking about a situation in the present or future that is hypothetical, unlikely or impossible, we use: </p>
<p> If + Past Simple, ...Would + Verb </p>
<p> We use a past verb though are imagining the present or the future to be different. </p>
<p> The second clause of subject + would + verb (conditional verb) is conditional to the first clause happening (or will only happen if the first part/clause happens). </p>
<p> Example: If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world. </p>
<p> = It is unlikely that I will win the lottery, but I'm going to hypothetically imagine that I did win. In that situation I would travel around the world. So in order for me to travel around the world, I would need the first clause (the condition or situation) to happen, that is, for me to win the lottery first. </p>
<p> If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world. (Though I am unlikely to win the lottery) </p>
<p> If I knew his name, I would tell you. </p>
<p> If I didn't have a headache, I would go to the party. </p>
<p> If I became President, I would reduce the salaries of all politicians. (Though it is unlikely I will become President) </p>
<p> Notice how we use a comma after the past tense clause. </p>
<p> We can also reverse the order and use: </p>
<p> Conditional verb (would + verb) + If + Past Simple </p>
<p> I would be happy if I had more free time. </p>
<p> I would tell you the answer if I knew what it was. </p>
<p> There would be fewer accidents if everyone drove more carefully. </p>
<p> We would have a lot of money if we sold our house. </p>
<p> What would you do if you saw a U.F.O? </p>
<p> Notice how the comma is not necessary with this word order. </p>
<p> If I were ... </p>
<p> Note that with the verb To Be we use IF + I / HE / SHE / IT + WERE </p>
<p> The reason we use WERE instead of WAS is because the sentence is in the Subjunctive mood. </p>
<p> If I were not in debt, I would quit my job. </p>
<p> If he were taller, he'd be accepted into the team. </p>
<p> She would still be correcting my grammar if she were still alive. </p>
<p> Though in informal English, you will hear some people say If I was... If he was... etc. This usage doesn't sound good though unfortunately is common. </p>
<p> Could in Second Conditional sentences </p>
<p> COULD can be used instead of WOULD to make the hypothetical present or future more likely. </p>
<p> If he trained every day, he could represent his country </p>
<p> If I had a little more money, I could buy a car. </p>

<p> Second Conditional </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Here is a free lesson plan on the second conditional for ESL/EFL teachers. The lesson starts with a presentation of the grammar structure, and is then followed by some ideas on how to get your students to practise it. You don't need to do all the exercises consecutively over one lesson, some of them can be used to revise (or review, if you're American) the second conditional in follow up lessons. You will find a free downloadable printout of this lesson at the bottom of this page. </p>
<p> Grammar Presentation </p>
<p> These are things which are: </p>
<p> Possible, but much less probable than First Conditional sentences. </p>
<p> Unreal events </p>
<p> The grammar structure for the second conditional is as follows: </p>
<p> The correct form of the verb ‘to be’ in the if-clause, is were, but was is also possible, and is often used in spoken English e.g. I would eat that muffin, if it were/was mine. </p>
<p> The Second Conditional is used for giving advice: </p>
<p> If I were you, I would resign. </p>
<p> If I were you, I would go to bed earlier. </p>
<p> Exercise 1 - Controlled Practice </p>
<p> Get the students to fill in the gaps with the correct form of the verb. You will find the answers in the Teacher's Notes in the Downloadable Lesson at the bottom of this page. </p>
<p> If she_________ (make) more effort, I would ____________(consider) helping her. </p>
<p> If electric cars didn’t ________(have) such large batteries, they would _________(be) quicker to drive. </p>
<p> I wouldn’t __________(carry) my wallet around in my pocket if I ________(be) you. </p>
<p> If I __________(train) properly, I could ___________(run) a marathon. </p>
<p> I would _________(go) on a diet if I _________(be) overweight. </p>
<p> If I ________(have) a garden, I would __________(grow) roses. </p>
<p> Would you __________(be) surprised if it ___________(snow) in July? </p>
<p> If I ________(know) his number, I could _________(give) him a call. </p>
<p> You would _________(get) better results, if you __________(work) harder. </p>
<p> If I ___________(have) more spare time, I would __________(write) a book. </p>
<p> Exercise 2 - Free Practice </p>
<p> If I were an alien…….. </p>
<p> Place the flashcards face down on the table, and get the students to pick one up, and complete the sentence in their own words. </p>
<p> Exercise 3 </p>
<p> Give the students blank flashcards. On each of their flashcards they need to write the first clause of a second conditional sentence. Once they have all completed this task, place the flashcards face down on the table. The students need to take it in turns to pick one up, and complete the sentences in their own words. </p>
<p> Exercise 4 </p>
<p> You are going to give the students the first clause of one second conditional sentence. The first student has to complete that sentence in their own words. The next student has to take the second clause from the first student's sentence, and change it into the first clause of another sentence, and complete that sentence. The next student continues in the same way e.g. </p>
<p> I would be happy if …… </p>
<p> First student: I would be happy if it was sunny every day. </p>
<p> Second student: If it were sunny every day, I would want to spend every day at the beach. </p>
<p> Third student: If I spent every day at the beach, I would be good at surfing. </p>
<p> Fourth student: If I were good at surfing, I would go to international competitions. </p>
<p> Some potential starters: </p>
<p> I would be happy if ……. </p>
<p> If I lived in the country …… </p>
<p> Exercise 5 </p>
<p> Meet Jane and John. They are about to get married, but John has arrived at the wedding looking like this. Get the students to make sentences describing what John would have to do, to make Jane happier about his appearance e.g. </p>
<p> If he took off his sunglasses, he would look much better. </p>
<p> Jane would really appreciate it if John shaved. </p>
<p> Exercise 6 </p>
<p> Get the students to answer the following questions: </p>
<p> What historical period would you travel to if you could travel to any time at all? </p>
<p> Who would you want to meet if you could meet anyone at all – past or present? </p>
<p> If you could change the history syllabus at school, what would you do? </p>
<p> If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? </p>
<p> If you had one wish, what would it be? </p>
<p> If you could go (or go back) to university, what would you study? </p>

<p> Second conditional - Rules and exercises for intermediate level </p>
<p> Example of second conditional: If I won £1,000,000, I would go on holiday. This image is licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license </p>
<p> An overview of the second conditional tense explains what rules you need to follow when using this tense, with examples and exercises to help you learn. This online lesson in English grammar is designed for intermediate level students. </p>
<p> Uses of the second conditional </p>
<p> We use the second conditional to talk about future events which are unlikely to happen. We also use it to talk about present events which are impossible. </p>
<p> Form of the second conditional </p>
<p> past simple (condition) </p>
<p> would </p>
<p> infinitive (result) </p>
<p> The result is what happens because of this condition. </p>
<p> Example: If I won £1,000,000 (the condition), I would go on holiday (the result). </p>
<p> Second conditional: question </p>
<p> Uses of the second conditional </p>
<p> We can also use 'were' instead of 'was' with 'I' and 'he/she/it' in formal writing. Some people consider this old-fashioned, but both forms are correct. </p>
<p> Example: If + she + was + a + man + she + would + play + football. If + she + were + a + man + she + would + play + football. </p>
<p> Remember! In the plural forms ('we', 'you' and 'they') we must always use 'were'! </p>
<p> We can also put the 'would + infinitive' (result) clause first: </p>
<p> Example: I + would + play + football (result) + if + I + were + a + man (condition) </p>
<p> Second conditional, be careful! </p>
<p> 1. After 'would' we always require the infinitive form of the main verb. </p>
<p> 2. The clause with the modal verb is always the result. </p>
<p> 3. Notice in the negative the past simple form applied to the auxiliary 'do' which is followed by the infinitive of the main verb. </p>
<p> 4. In the question form, we have a verb-subject inversion. </p>
<p> Use of different modal verbs with the second conditional </p>
<p> We use different modal verbs in the second conditional to change the meaning of the result. </p>
<p> If I won £1,000,000, I would go on holiday (expressing intention) </p>
<p> If I won £1,000,000, I could go on holiday (expressing ability) </p>
<p> If I won £1,000,000, I should go on holiday (expressing obligation) </p>
<p> If I won £1,000,000, I might go on holiday (expressing possibility) </p>
<p> Uses of the second conditional </p>
<p> There are two main uses for the second conditional: </p>
<p> 1. A future event or situation which is unlikely to happen: </p>
<p> 'If I didn't have a job, I would sleep all day.' (Most people need a job!) </p>
<p> 'If she became the president of the USA, she would ban smoking.' (This is very unlikely) </p>
<p> 'If you learnt Chinese, you could make a lot of money as a translator.' (Not many people learn to speak Chinese!) </p>
<p> 2. A present event or situation which is impossible: </p>
<p> 'If I was a dog, I would sleep all day.' (It's impossible to change into a dog!) </p>
<p> 'If he lived on the moon, he would build a big house.' (It's impossible to live on the moon!) </p>
<p> 'If it rained money, we would be rich.' (Impossible!) </p>
<p> Second conditional, be careful again! </p>
<p> We can also use the second conditional to give advice, using this structure: </p>
<p> If I Were you I would infinitive </p>
<p> 'If + I + were + you + I + would + infinitive (It's impossible for one person to 'be' another!) </p>
<p> If I were you, I would learn to drive. </p>
<p> If I were you, I wouldn't do that. </p>
<p> If I were you, I would spend less money. </p>
<p> The second conditional is used to talk about events which are more unlikely than in the first conditional. </p>
<p> Example: </p>
<p> First - If I drive to work, I will buy some groceries (likely) </p>
<p> Second - If I drove to the Antarctic, I would need a lot of gas (unlikely) </p>

<p> Second conditional if, also known as type two conditional, is used for unreal situations in present or future time. The condition statement is unreal at the moment and the dependent is impossible or unlikely to happen. </p>
<p> If I were rich, I would buy a boat. If the weather was nice, we could barbecue. </p>
<p> If I were rich... I am not rich, it is not likely that I will be rich (anytime soon anyway) and buy a boat. I might win the lottery tomorrow? (unreal situation, improbability) </p>
<p> Type 2 Conditional Grammar </p>
<p> If + Subject + Simple Past + Subject 2 + Would / Could + Verb </p>
<p> a. If you listened carefully, you would understand the lecture easily. b. If I were you, I wouldn't drive so fast. c. If Ronald came early, he could help us. d. If it didn't rain, we could play basketball. </p>
<p> Note: </p>
<p> The main clause and if clause can be in reversed order. </p>
<p> If I could jump high enough, I would escape. I would escape if I could jump high enough. </p>
<p> If I had money, I would buy a Ferrari. I would buy a Ferrari If I had money. </p>

<p> The Second Conditional </p>
<p> The second conditional uses the past simple after if, then 'would' and the infinitive: </p>
<p> if + past simple, ...would + infinitive </p>
<p> (We can use 'were' instead of 'was' with 'I' and 'he/she/it'. This is mostly done in formal writing). </p>
<p> It has two uses. </p>
<p> First, we can use it to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true. Maybe I'm imagining some dream for example. </p>
<p> If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.(I probably won't win the lottery) </p>
<p> If I met the Queen of England, I would say hello. </p>
<p> She would travel all over the world if she were rich. </p>
<p> She would pass the exam if she ever studied.(She never studies, so this won't happen) </p>
<p> Second, we can use it to talk about something in the present which is impossible, because it's not true. Is that clear? Have a look at the examples: </p>
<p> If I had his number, I would call him. (I don't have his number now, so it's impossible for me to call him). </p>
<p> If I were you, I wouldn't go out with that man. </p>
<p> How is this different from the first conditional? </p>
<p> This kind of conditional sentence is different from the first conditional because this is a lot more unlikely. </p>
<p> For example (second conditional): If I had enough money I would buy a house with twenty bedrooms and a swimming pool (I'm probably not going to have this much money, it's just a dream, not very real) </p>
<p> But (first conditional): If I have enough money, I'll buy some new shoes (It's much more likely that I'll have enough money to buy some shoes) </p>

<p> SECOND AND THIRD CONDITIONALS </p>
<p> by Jane Lawson at DailyStep.com </p>
<p> Many English learners say this topic is confusing. But really, it is not difficult if you learn the structure. My last lesson covered Zero and First Conditionals, so today we are going to look at the last 3 types: Second, Third and Mixed Conditionals. </p>
<p> SECOND CONDITIONAL </p>
<p> I live in London so I travel every day on London buses. </p>
<p> I travel every day on London buses because I live in London. (note: this is the REAL present situation) </p>
<p> If I didn’t live in London, I would not travel every day on London buses. I would not travel every day on London buses if I did not live in London. </p>
<p> (note: this is the UNREAL present situation) </p>
<p> We use this Second Conditional structure to talk about unreal or very improbable situations in the present or future, in other words, for the hypothetical present or future. The structure is: </p>
<p> The mistake that I hear the most often with conditionals is this: </p>
<p> THIRD CONDITIONAL </p>
<p> I moved to London and I met him. (note: this is the REAL past situation) </p>
<p> If I had not moved to London, I would not have met him. I would not have met him if I had not moved to London. </p>
<p> (note: this is the UNREAL past situation) </p>
<p> We use this Third Conditional structure to talk about unreal situations in the past, in other words, for the hypothetical past. The structure is: </p>
<p> If I had been listening to the radio at that time, </p>
<p> Had I been listening to the radio at that time, </p>
<p> I would have heard the news. </p>
<p> One of the problems that English learners face with conditionals in conversation, both speaking and listening, is the way they are pronounced. Listen to these sentences for both second and third conditional again: </p>
<p> 1. If I won the lottery, I’d be rich. </p>
<p> 2. If I were you, I’d take the job. </p>
<p> 3. If they were serious about helping, they’d be trying to find a solution. </p>
<p> 4. If I hadn’t moved to London, I wouldn't have met him. </p>
<p> 5. If he’d crossed the road two minutes earlier, he’d have been hit by a bus. </p>
<p> 6. If I’d been listening to the radio at that time, I’d have heard the news. </p>
<p> As you can hear, we do not say WOULD clearly and we rarely say HAD clearly. We use quick, short pronunciation forms instead. So unless you practise and listen carefully, you might miss conditionals in conversation. If you can use these quick pronunciation forms (also called contractions) in conversation and in spoken English Exams, your English will sound much more natural. </p>
<p> Finally, let's look at MIXED CONDITIONALS </p>
<p> If I had not created the DailyStep English website, you would not be listening to this lesson. (note: this refers to how the unreal past affects the unreal present.) </p>
<p> So Mixed Conditionals are nothing new - they are just a mixture of Second and Third Conditionals. We use them to talk about unreal past and unreal present together. Take a look at these examples: </p>
<p> So, now you know these structures, there are a just a couple of rules to remember: </p>
<p> 1. If the main clause comes before the conditional clause, there is NO COMMA between the clauses. </p>
<p> So, now try to make some conditional sentences about your own life. Here are a few questions you could try to answer: </p>
<p> 1. What would you like to do if you could choose any job in the world? </p>
<p> 2. If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money? </p>
<p> 3. How would you have felt if you had met Nelson Mandela? 4. If you were on holiday, what would you be doing now? </p>

<p> English Grammar: First & Second Conditional Review & Exercises (Future Real/Future Unreal/Present Unreal) </p>
<p> English Level: Intermediate </p>
<p> Language Focus: A review of the future real (first conditional) and present and future unreal conditional (second conditional). Includes practice exercises. </p>
<p> Review: The First Conditional (Future Real) </p>
<p> The first conditional is also called the future real conditional. It is used to talk about real possibilities in the future. </p>
<p> Form: [ If + subject + present simple ] , (then) [ subject + will + verb ] </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If I finish my work, I will go home. </p>
<p> If she needs help, then I will help her. </p>
<p> If it rains tonight, I will stay home. </p>
<p> All these examples describe real possibilities in the future. The speaker thinks they can happen. </p>
<p> For example: You are watching a football game on TV. Your team is playing well. You want them to win. Is it possible that they will win? Yes, it’s very possible. It’s a real possibility for the future. So, we can say, </p>
<p> If my team wins, I will be happy. </p>
<p> It’s also possible that they will lose. </p>
<p> If my team loses, I will be angry. </p>
<p> That’s basically it: we use the first conditional for real possibilities in the future. Easy, isn’t it? </p>
<p> Review: The Second Conditional </p>
<p> The second conditional is used in two ways, but the grammatical form is the same for both. </p>
<p> Form: [ If + subject + past tense ] , (then) [ subject + would/could/might + verb ] </p>
<p> Let’s look at how we use it. </p>
<p> The Second Conditional for Future Unreal Events </p>
<p> The second conditional can also be called the future unreal conditional. It is used to talk about impossible or unlikely future events. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> If we had an earthquake tomorrow, I would be surprised. (the speaker doesn’t think this will happen) </p>
<p> If someone jumped out of this window, they could die. (the speaker doesn’t think someone would do this) </p>
<p> If the Internet stopped working, then people would go outside. (this speaker doesn’t think it will stop) </p>
<p> These are all events in the future that are impossible or very unlikely (there’s a low chance they will happen). When we use the second conditional to describe future events, we are saying that we don’t think the event will happen. </p>
<p> Let’s look at sentence #1. Now, if you live in Japan or a place with many earthquakes, it would be more possible for there to be an earthquake. If you thought it was a real possibility, you would say, </p>
<p> If we have an earthquake tomorrow, I will be scared. (First conditional — The speaker thinks this could happen.) </p>
<p> Now, if you live in Toronto, there is almost no chance of an earthquake. Here, it is not a real future possibility. Someone in Toronto would say, </p>
<p> If we had an earthquake tomorrow, I would be surprised. (Second conditional – the speaker thinks it’s not possible.) </p>
<p> Sometimes it’s obvious if something is a real possibility or not. At other times, it can depend on our mood or attitude. Here’s another example. </p>
<p> Lisa buys lottery tickets every week. She thinks she will win one day. She says, </p>
<p> If I win the lottery, I will buy a house. </p>
<p> John hardly every buys lottery tickets. He knows it’s almost impossible to win. He says, </p>
<p> If I won the lottery, I would buy a house. </p>
<p> Because he’s using the second conditional, we know that John doesn’t think it’s a real possibility. </p>
<p> In summary, it can depend on mood, but usually it’s fairly clear if something is a real possibility for the future or not. Before I explain the next way we use the second conditional, let’s try some exercises to see if you understand. </p>
<p> Important Note: The Condition and Result Clause Can be Switched </p>
<p> The condition clause is the part of the sentence that starts with IF. For example, “If I pass the test, …“. The result clause explains what will happen if this condition is true. For example, “I will celebrate.” </p>
<p> If I pass the test, I will celebrate. </p>
<p> [ condition ] + [ result ] </p>
<p> In any conditional sentence, the result can also come before the condition. The grammar rules for each clause stay the same. When this happens, we don’t use a comma. </p>
<p> I will celebrate if I pass the test. (no comma) </p>
<p> [ result ] + [ condition ] </p>
<p> There is no difference in meaning between these two sentences. </p>
<p> Exercise #1 – Future Real or Future Unreal Conditionals </p>
<p> First, practice identifying the first and second conditional forms. All you have to do is write correct verb. </p>
<p> If you invite her, she (come) to the meeting. </p>
<p> If it (snow) 60 centimetres, we wouldn’t be able to leave our house. </p>
<p> If you ask Peter, he (not/refuse). You should ask him. </p>
<p> She (not/marry) Lou if he asked her. </p>
<p> I would be very surprised if the new company (succeed). </p>
<p> Alan is busy. If he (have) time tonight, he would exercise. He’ll be too busy though. </p>
<p> The passengers (not/be) happy if their flight is delayed. </p>
<p> Check Answers </p>
<p> Exercise #2 – Future Real or Future Unreal Conditionals </p>
<p> Look at the situations and decide if the action in the condition is a real possibility for the speaker or not. If it’s not a real possibility, use the second conditional. Otherwise, use the first. </p>
<p> There are dark clouds in the sky. If it (rain), we (get) wet. Let’s go inside. </p>
<p> John is driving his car. Traffic is worse than he expected. If he (not/arrive) home on time, his dinner (be) cold. </p>
<p> Viviane is at the pet store. Her boy loves dogs and doesn’t like cats. If she (buy) a cat, her son (start) crying. So, she is going to buy a cute dog. </p>
<p> Tara is tired. If she (go) to bed soon, she (not/be) tired tomorrow. However, she is going to stay up and watch a movie. </p>
<p> Jason is hungry. He sees a slice of pizza in the refrigerator. He says to his sister, “Are you going to eat that slice of pizza? If you (not/want) it, I (eat) it.” </p>
<p> Check Answers </p>
<p> Now, it’s time to talk about the second way that we use the second conditional. </p>
<p> The Second Conditional for Present Unreal Events (Counter-factual) </p>
<p> Form: [ If + subject + past tense ] , (then) [ subject + would/could/might + verb ] </p>
<p> (The form is the same.) </p>
<p> We use this conditional, the present unreal conditional, to imagine things that are the opposite of reality. We use it to think about the opposite of the current situation or fact. </p>
<p> First, let’s look at some (present real) facts or truths. </p>
<p> Playing football is fun. </p>
<p> The earth is not flat. </p>
<p> I cannot sing well. </p>
<p> Now, let’s imagine if the opposite of the above facts were true, and what effects that could have. </p>
<p> If playing football were not fun, people would not play it. </p>
<p> If the earth were flat, people might fall off of it. </p>
<p> If I could sing well, I would sing karaoke more. </p>
<p> In other words, the opposite of these statements is always true. It’s called the unreal conditional because you are imagining an unreal (fictional) situation. If someone says, “If I were tall, I would play basketball“, then we know that they are not tall. If someone says, “If I had a million dollars, I would buy a boat.”, this means they do not have a million dollars. They are dreaming or imagining a situation that is the opposite of the truth. </p>
<p> Grammar note: Many people (including me) don’t use ‘was’ in conditionals. Instead, we use ‘were’. For example, If I were you, I wouldn’t do that. You can also use was, but some people might say it’s poor grammar. </p>
<p> Let me give you some facts. Then I want you to make conditional sentences by imaging the opposite situation. </p>
<p> Exercise #3 – The Present Unreal Conditional </p>
<p> (Note: To make it simple, please use ‘would’ instead of ‘might’ in these exercises. ‘Can’ can be changed to ‘could’.) </p>
<p> Junk food is bad for your health. If it (be) healthy, people (eat) more of it. </p>
<p> You only have two arms. If you (have) three arms, you (can/carry) more things. </p>
<p> John dislikes his job. If he (like) his job, he (not/mind) waking up every morning. </p>
<p> Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If we (not/make) his mistakes, we (not/learn) anything. </p>
<p> Tara lives in London. If she (not/live) in London, she (not/have) to pay such high rent. </p>
<p> Check Answers </p>
<p> Review of the Future Real, Future Unreal, and Present Unreal </p>
<p> We have learned the following: </p>
<p> 1. The First Conditional (the Future Real) is used to talk about real possibilities in the future. </p>
<p> Lisa and John love each other. If they get married, they will buy a house. (They love each other. There is a real chance they will get married). </p>
<p> 2. The Second Conditional is used for two situations: </p>
<p> a) Impossible or unlikely situations in the future. </p>
<p> Lisa and John hate each other. If they got married, they would fight a lot. (They don’t like each other, so they probably won’t get married). </p>
<p> b) Imagining situations that are the opposite of the present situation. </p>
<p> Lisa and John love each other. If they didn’t love each other, they wouldn’t spend time together. (Fact: They do spend time together) </p>
<p> Do you understand? The next exercise will be more challenging. </p>
<p> Exercise #4 – First or Second Conditional? </p>
<p> Read the statements below. Then make a conditional sentence based on it. </p>
<p> I’m so busy. That’s why I don’t exercise. If I (not/be) busy, I (exercise). </p>
<p> Sadly, the environment is being destroyed. If this (continue), more and more animal species (disappear). </p>
<p> I don’t play sports. However, it’s only because I’m not in shape. If I (be) in shape, I (play) sports. </p>
<p> I can’t do my job because my boss doesn’t explain things properly. If he (explain) things properly, I (be) able to do my job. </p>
<p> Mohammed has applied to study abroad in Canada. If he (accept), he (study) in Vancouver. </p>
<p> Check Answers </p>
<p> I can’t stop smoking. The problem is, I feel nervous all the time. If I (not/feel) nervous all the time, I (can/stop) smoking. </p>
<p> It’s the middle of summer. It’s very hot. If it (snow) tomorrow, I (not/believe) it. </p>
<p> You are not me. You don’t know how I feel. If you (be) me, you (know) how I feel. </p>
<p> Your English will probably continue to improve. If it further (improve), you (feel) more confident. </p>
<p> I’m so tired because I play video games every night. If I (not/play) video games so much, I (not/feel) so terrible every day. </p>
<p> Check Answers </p>
<p> Exercise #5 – Making Present Unreal Questions </p>
<p> We haven’t reviewed this, but try to take the below words and form a question in the second conditional (present unreal). </p>
<p> Note: be sure to add proper punctuation (e.g. commas, question marks)! </p>
<p> (if / you / be the leader of your country / what / you / do) = </p>
<p> (what / you / do / if / you / have more free time) = </p>
<p> (if / you / can / go / anywhere in the world / where / you / travel) = </p>
<p> (if / today / be / your last day on earth / what / you / do) = </p>
<p> (you / wear / glasses / if / you / cannot / see / well ) = </p>
<p> Check Answers </p>
<p> That’s the end of the lesson. I hope this has been useful. If you find any mistakes, or you have a question, please leave a comment below. </p>

<p> Thanks again! (I believe) I have fixed the mistakes. </p>
<p> I have completed the exercise #5 just as the same as the correct answers show but every time I check my answers, I see ‘You have made 5 mistake(s)’. </p>

<p> Many earlier language-teaching methods included elements that can be effective in teaching grammar to adult ESL students, yet the methods in their “pure” versions have been found to be inadequate in addressing these students’ needs. The advantages as well as the limitations of some popular methods are summarized in the chart below. For further information on these and other approaches to second-language instruction, refer to Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching, by Jack C. Richards and Theodore S. Rodgers. </p>
<p> Approach/Method </p>
<p> Advantages </p>
<p> Limitations </p>
<p> Grammar-translation Method (nineteenth–mid- twentieth centuries) </p>
<p> Explicit teaching of grammar rules; attention paid to language forms </p>
<p> Absence of communicative practice, which is an immediate need for new immigrants </p>
<p> Reliance on translation, which is impractical in classes having students with many different first languages </p>
<p> Focus on reading and translating texts; some adult students can’t read in their first language </p>
<p> Direct Method (first part of twentieth century) </p>
<p> Grammar is taught Lessons begin with dialog or a story in the target language Use of visuals (actions, pictures, objects) to convey meaning </p>
<p> Inductive presentation is unsuitable for some adult students, who may benefit from overt explanations of rules Minimal reading and writing, which is needed by immigrant students with work or academic goals </p>
<p> Audiolingual Method (ALM) (1950s–1970s) </p>
<p> Emphasis on oral production Teacher models pronunciation Use of drills to reinforce grammatical patterns </p>
<p> Rote exercises reduce cognitive engagement Activities are designed to prevent learner errors, which reduces the need for students to negotiate meaning </p>
<p> Cognitive Approach (1970s) </p>
<p> Grammar must be taught, either inductively or deductively </p>
<p> Emphasis on analyzing structure at the expense of communicative practice </p>
<p> Pronunciation is de-emphasized </p>
<p> Natural Approach (1980s) </p>
<p> Language is presented in a “natural” sequence: listening, speaking, reading, writing </p>
<p> Use of a communicative syllabus </p>
<p> Grammar is not overtly taught, yet many adult learners need and want grammar instruction </p>
<p> Focus on input (listening) can delay output (speaking) that adults need immediately </p>
<p> Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) (1970s–today) </p>
<p> Communication is the goal of instruction Emphasis on meaningful interaction Course syllabus includes language functions Use of authentic texts and contexts </p>
<p> Focus on communication can result in ignoring grammar Emphasis on fluency at the expense of accuracy can result in many students never attaining correct grammar </p>

<p> There are many online tools that can be used to convert a PDF file to an editable Microsoft Word document, but the end result is usually far from good, especially if you have tables or even just two columns in the document. Pdf2doc.com provides a powerful alternative with a user friendly interface. Just drag and drop your files to the greenish square that says "Drop Your Files Here" and wait for them to upload. Once they are uploaded and converted, which usually takes seconds for a PDF file with a few pages, a download link will appear. Download your document and edit away! </p>

<p> Most learners and teachers of English have difficulty pronouncing certain words or may not know at all how to pronounce some of them, especially names of people, places, brands etc. YouGlish finds videos of native speakers saying any word or phrase you type from Youtube videos. You can even choose the accent of your preference. </p>
<p> Sunday, October 14, 2018 </p>
<p> Lingro is an online tool that enables you to turn any website into reading practice with an easy-to-use interface. What you do is simply: </p>
<p> Go to your favorite newspaper's website (or any website that has text in it) </p>
<p> Find a news article you want to read </p>
<p> Copy the link and paste it into the bar at the top of Lingro's homepage. </p>
<p> Choose your dictionary (Many language pairs are available.) </p>
<p> Click the arrow. </p>
<p> Now all the words on that page are clickable dictionary entries. Simply click on anything you want to look up/translate. </p>

<p> You can do this activity after introducing and doing some practice on the modal 'should'. </p>
<p> Ask students to take a piece of paper and write a problem they have. It's best if it is a real problem, but they can obviously make something up if they don't want to talk about their problems in class. </p>
<p> Ask each student to write a nickname. </p>
<p> Collect the pieces of paper in a box, mix them up a little, and give them back to the students making sure that nobody gets their own paper back. </p>
<p> Ask students to write some advice for the problem they receive. </p>
<p> When they are finished writing their advice, ask students to read it out for the whole class. </p>
<p> Saturday, March 4, 2017 </p>
<p> This activity aims to help learners practice modals of deduction. (Have a look at this post to learn more about these modals.) </p>
<p> Students work in groups of up to 6. (If you have fewer than 6 in each group, just don't use all the photos.) </p>
<p> Each student gets one of these photos. (I asked them to choose one of the photos without showing them what was in the photo.) </p>
<p> They try to guess what these inventions are and try to justify their deductions. (e.g. This must be something for working people because it is attached to a tie.) </p>
<p> The group members also share their opinions about the same photo, if any. </p>
<p> All the group members take turns doing the same until they have discussed all the photos. </p>

<p> THE TYPES OF CONDITIONAL SENTENCES </p>
<p> * The conditional sentences are sometimes confusing for learners of English. Watch out: 1) Which type of the conditional sentences is used? 2) Where is the if-clause (e.g. at the beginning or at the end of the conditional sentence)? There are three types of the if-clauses. 1- The Zero Conditional: (if + present simple, ... present simple) * When we talk about things that are generally or always true, we can use: - If/When/Unless plus a present form PLUS present simple or imperative.examples: - If he gets there before me, ask him to wait. - When you fly budget airline, you have to pay for your drinks and snacks. - Unless you need more space, a small car is big enough for one person. * Notice that 'unless' means the same as 'if not'. * We can make a zero conditional sentence with two present simple verbs (one in the 'if clause' and one in the 'main clause'): If + present simple, .... present simple. examples: If people eat too much, they get fat. People die if they don't eat. 2- The First Conditional: (if + present simple, ... will + infinitive) * We use the First Conditional to talk about future events that are likely to happen.example: - If it rains, I won't go to the park. * The 'if' clause can be used with different present forms.examples: - If I see her, I'll tell her. - If he's feeling better, he'll come. - If they haven’t heard the good news yet, I'll tell them. * The "future clause" can contain 'going to' or the future perfect as well as 'will'. examples: - If I see him, I'm going to tell him exactly how angry I am. - If we don't get the contract, we'll have wasted a lot of time and money. * The "future clause" can also contain other modal verbs such as 'can' and 'must'. examples: - If you go to New York, you must have the cheesecake in Lindy's. - If he comes, you can get a lift home with him. * First vs. Zero Conditional: -The first conditional describes a particular situation, whereas the zero conditional describes what happens in general. -For example (zero conditional): if you sit in the sun, you get burned (here I'm talking about every time a person sits in the sun - the burning is a natural consequence of the sitting) -But (first conditional): if you sit in the sun, you'll get burned (here I'm talking about what will happen today, another day might be different) 3- The Second Conditional: (if + past simple, ... would + infinitive) * we can use it to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true. Maybe I'm imagining some dream for example. - If I had millions dollars, I'd give a lot to charity. Note that after I / he/ she /it we often use the subjunctive form 'were' and not 'was'. (Some people think that 'were' is the only 'correct' form but other people think 'was' is equally ‘correct’.) example: - If she were happy in her job, she wouldn't be looking for another one. we can use it to talk about something in the present which is impossible, because it's not true. Is that clear? Have a look at the examples: - If I had his number, I would call him. (I don't have his number now, so it's impossible for me to call him). * Note the form 'If I were you' which is often used to give advice.example: - If I were you, I wouldn't go out with that man. * Note that the main clause can contain 'would' 'could' or 'might. - If I had the chance to do it again, I would do it differently. - If we met up for lunch, we could go to that new restaurant. - If I spoke to him directly, I might be able to persuade him. * Also note that sometimes the 'if clause' is implied rather than spoken. - What would I do without you? ("if you weren't here") - Where would I get one at this time of night? ("if I wanted one") - He wouldn't agree. ("if I asked him") * First vs. Second Conditional: - How is this different from the first conditional? -This kind of conditional sentence is different from the first conditional because this is a lot more unlikely. - For example (second conditional): If I had enough money I would buy a house with twenty bedrooms and a swimming pool (I'm probably not going to have this much money, it's just a dream, not very real) - But (first conditional): If I have enough money, I'll buy some new clothes (It's much more likely that I'll have enough money to buy some clothes). 4- The Third Conditional (if + past perfect, ... would + have + past participle) * We can use the Third Conditional to talk about 'impossible' conditions, impossible because they are in the past and we cannot change what has happened.examples: - If I had gone to bed early, I would have caught the train. - If we had taken a taxi, we wouldn't have missed the plane - She wouldn't have been tired if she had gone to bed earlier * Notice that the main clause can contain 'would', 'could' or 'might. If I had seen him at the meeting, I would have asked him. (But he wasn't there so I didn't.) examples: - If I had seen him at the meeting, I could have asked him. ( But he wasn't there so it wasn't possible.) - If I had seen him at the meeting, I might have asked him. (But I'm not sure. Perhaps if the opportunity had arisen.) - If I had paid more attention in class, I would have understood the lesson. * Also notice that sometimes the 'if clause' is implied rather than spoken.examples: - I'd have done it. ("if you had asked me but you didn't.") - I wouldn't have said that. ("if I'd been there.") - He wouldn't have let him get away with that. ("if he had tried that with me.") Thanks for reading !! </p>

<p> There is often very little difference between the future tenses. It often depends where you live (in Britain or the USA) and when you use the sentence (in spoken or written communication). • In newspapers we often use the will-future, when the going to-future is used in oral communication. - Newspaper: The headmaster will close the old gym. - Oral: The headmaster is going to close the old gym. - We can substitute the going to-future with the Present Progressive when using an expression of time. - She is going to see Frank at the airport at 8.30. - She is seeing Frank at the airport at 8.30. </p>
<p> * There are several different ways in English that you can talk about the future. </p>
<p> 1- will-future (will + infinitive). * Usage: Prediction, assumption; spontaneous action; action happens without the speaker’s intention -Example: He will carry this bag for her. </p>
<p> 2- going to-future (to be (am, are, is) + going to + infinitive). * Usage: The auxiliary verb going to is used in talking about intentions. (An intention is… </p>
<p> The verb to be is used in a number of different ways in English. Here are the main uses of the verb to be for reference, self-study and in-class use. </p>
<p> To be - Main Verb - Role </p>
<p> To be is used as a main verb to indicate the role or position that one has at work, family, or other organization. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> Jennifer is my sister. Frank is a doctor. Alan was a guest at our house last week. </p>
<p> To be - Main Verb with Adjective </p>
<p> To be is also used as a main verb together with adjectives to express qualities about someone. It's possible to use only adjectives with Be, or adjectives which modify other nouns. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> She is a beautiful woman. Jack was a handsome man. She is interesting. They are ugly. </p>
<p> To be - Main Verb - Location </p>
<p> To be is used as a main verb to indicate location. </p>
<p> Examples: </p>
<p> They are at lunch. Our house is in the countryside. Alice is in the backyard. </p>
<p> In all the perfect tenses the verb "have" is used as an auxiliary verb. In all the simple tenses, the verb "have" can be used as the main verb </p>
<p> When the verb "have" is used as the main verb, it is usually used only in the simple form (static verbs). </p>
<p> The verb "have" can be used in the progressive tense, only in the present and future. </p>
<p> The verb have can not be used in the past progressive tenses. </p>
<p> Positive Sentences - Main Verb - Verb "have" Subject Main Verb "Have" Continue the Sentence I have /had/will have a car. We have /had/will have a lot of homework. You have/had/will have a nice house. The cars have/had/will have new tires. Natalie has/had/will have a great time in the States. Her father has/had/will have a very good job. </p>
<p> PAST PROGRESSIVE TENSE ----> What is the past progressive tense? </p>
<p> The past progressive tense describes an action in progress around a specific time in the past. Here are two examples: </p>
<p> Q: What were you doing at 10:00 this morning? A: I was getting ready for school (at 10:00 this morning). </p>
<p> Q: What were you doing when I called you? A: I was walking the dog (when you called me). </p>
<p> Note that in all the sentences, a particular time is referenced. In the first example, both the question and the answer mention 10:00 am. In the second example, when you called me refers to a specific time which both speakers understand. (Perhaps, for example, the phone call was placed on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00. Both speakers know this, so the time is specific.) </p>
<p> It's also important to note that we don't use the past progressive tense for repeated actions in the past. The simple past tense is used for any repeated actions that happened in the past. </p>
<p> Causative verbs express an action which is caused to happen. In other words, when I have something done for me I cause it to happen. In other words, I do not actually do anything, but ask someone else to do it for me. This is the sense of causative verbs. </p>
<p> *The English verbs (let, make, have, get, and help) are called causative verbs because they cause something else to happen. Here are some specific examples of how causative verbs work in English sentences. How to use causative verbs in English </p>
<p> *LET = permit something to happen Grammatical structure: • LET + PERSON/THING + VERB (base form) Examples: • I don’t let my kids watch violent movies. • Mary’s father won’t let her adopt a puppy because he’s allergic to dogs. • Our boss doesn’t let us eat lunch at our desks; we have to eat in the cafeteria. • Oops! I wasn’t paying attention while cooking, and I let the food burn. • Don’t let the advertising expenses surpass $1000. Remember: The past tense of let is also let; there is no change! Note: The ver… </p>
<p> The explanations should help clarify the meaning and use of vocabulary related to travel Travel The word 'travel' is used to talk about going from one place to another. It can be a verb, a noun or an adjective : • Verb : Paul travels a lot in his job. • Noun : Travel nowadays is faster than before. • Adjective : There is a travel agency beside the bank. </p>
<p> Trip The word trip is used to talk about a short journey somewhere for a purpose, business or pleasure. • For our wedding anniversary, we went on a trip to Venice. • My boss is often away on business trips. • During our holiday we took a boat trip to the islands. </p>
<p> Journey A journey is the distance covered when travelling from one place to another. 'Journey' can refer to a long distance or a short regular one. • The journey was long and tiring. It took us 5 hours to get there. • Did you have a good journey? Yes, it was quite pleasant. • How long is your journey to work? Just about 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Descent means going downwards, a downward slope, or ancestry. Decent means civilized, good, or adequate. Dissent means to argue or a difference of opinion. </p>
<p> Descent, Decent, and Dissent There is often confusion over the words descent, decent, and dissent. </p>
<p> 1-Descent The noun descent has a few meanings: *The action of descending (i.e., going downwards). exp: The Boeing 737 started its descent from 20,000 feet. </p>
<p> *A downhill incline. exp: It features a long, steep descent that is ideal for advanced skiers. </p>
<p> *Family origin. exp: She is from Indian descent. </p>
<p> 2-Decent The adjective decent means civilized, good or adequate. (It rhymes with recent.) </p>
<p> Examples: Ninety-eight percent of the adults in this country are decent, hardworking citizens. That's a decent plate of food. </p>
<p> 3-Dissent Dissent can be a noun meaning difference of opinion or a verb meaning to disagree. </p>
<p> Examples: The referee has given him a red card for dissent. Acceptance of dissent is the fundamental requirement of a free society. I will dissent if you … </p>
<p> Today's lesson isn't only about grammar and vocabulary but also about morals and leadership . So I advice you to read it carefully . It permits you to understand your grammar points and to have some rich notions of life ..... </p>
<p> « THERE IS A STORY ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE NAMED EVERYBODY, SOMEBODY, ANYBODY AND NOBODY. THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT JOB TO BE DONE AND EVERYBODY WAS ASKED TO DO IT. EVERYBODY WAS SURE SOMEBODY WOULD DO IT. ANYBODY COULD HAVE DONE IT, BUT NOBODY DID IT. SOMEBODY GOT ANGRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT WAS EVERYBODY'S JOB. EVERYBODY THOUGHT ANYBODY WOULD DO IT BUT NOBODY REALIZED THAT EVERYBODY WOULDN'T DO IT. IT ENDED UP THAT EVERYBODY BLAMED SOMEBODY WHEN NOBODY DID WHAT ANYBODY COULD HAVE DONE. » </p>
<p> Did you follow that? The moral of the story, of course, is that nothing happened because no one took a leadership role in the important job to be done. Tasks are accomplished when somebody (not the Somebody in our story) takes… </p>

<p> 12 Travel Phrasal Verbs in English </p>
<p> Help other students to improve English skills </p>
<p> Travelling is a year round activity as people now go on holidays more than once a year. The following are phrasal verbs that are related to travel or, as you may name them, travel phrasal verbs. I have set out some key phrasal verbs that we use in a typical holiday trip. </p>
<p> SET OFF </p>
<p> When we begin a journey anywhere of a short or long duration we have to start from some place either our home or our office perhaps. </p>
<p> So we normally advise our friends or family that our holiday is about to start or we will set off shortly. </p>
<p> Example: John was going to Italy for a week. He told his family that he was due to set off at 4 pm for the airport and asked if someone could give him a lift. </p>
<p> SET OUT </p>
<p> Similar to set off we can also use this to describe the beginning of a journey. It sometimes refers to a shorter journey than a holiday, perhaps a trek or a walk. </p>
<p> Example: Michael is gone for a trek. He set out about an hour ago. </p>
<p> HEAD FOR </p>
<p> to start moving towards a place (town, city, etc) </p>
<p> Example: We had decided to head for Edinburgh. </p>
<p> CHECK IN/CHECK OUT </p>
<p> When we arrive at our destination, a hotel or apartment on Airbnb (perhaps) we usually have a time when we can check in. </p>
<p> And when we leave our hotel or apartment at the end of our vacation we are given a time to leave or check out. </p>
<p> Example: When I arrived in Barcelona I made my way (travelled to) to my hotel and checked in at about 2.30 pm. </p>
<p> On my day of departure I had to check out before 12 noon. It suited me fine as my flight was due to leave at 3 pm. </p>

<p> 12 Travel Phrasal Verbs in English </p>
<p> HOP ON/HOP OFF </p>
<p> I’m sure you are familiar with these 2 travel phrasal verbs. </p>
<p> Nowadays most of the cities offer visitors “the red bus” option to get a tour of the city. This red bus is sometime a replica of (a copy of) the old London buses. </p>
<p> These buses offer the option to hop on or off as you please at different locations around or across the city. You buy the ticket and you can get on (hop on) or get off (hop off) the bus at any location. </p>
<p> Example: We hopped on the train and went back to the hostel. </p>
<p> GET AROUND </p>
<p> Travelling is very enjoyable at any time. However, it is made easier due to the advances in transport options. We can travel by car, train, plane or even ship! </p>
<p> When setting out our plans for our holidays it is important to know how we will travel from one destination to another. Our friends may ask us what type of transport will we use. </p>
<p> How are you getting around? = How will you travel? </p>
<p> Example: David was travelling to 5 cities in 10 days. His friend wanted to know how he intended getting around. He had arranged to hire a car for that purpose. </p>
<p> SEE SOMEBODY OFF </p>
<p> When somebody is leaving for an extended time it is normal for family members to travel with that person to the point of departure (airport or train station) to wish them well and to wave goodbye. This we refer to as seeing somebody off. </p>
<p> Example: Mary was leaving for an extended working holiday in Australia. Her parents were anxious to go to the airport to see her off. She was going to be away for approximately 6 months. </p>

<p> 12 Travel Phrasal Verbs </p>
<p> GET BACK </p>
<p> When we go on a holiday or a business trip we usually have to come back at sometime. It is also normal for our colleagues family and friends to ask us when are we due to return when talking about our holiday. </p>
<p> Example: Declan was going on holiday to the USA and his boss wanted to know when he was due to get back to work. </p>
<p> So we can ask When are you getting back? or When do you get back to the office/home? or When are you due back? </p>
<p> GET GOING </p>
<p> When it is time to depart or to leave we often use the phrase “get going”. </p>
<p> We often use it together with the words “it’s about time…” because usually we are in a hurry or in a rush. </p>
<p> Example: Igor was late packing his bag and needed to get to the airport as quickly as possible. He told his wife it was “about time he got going”. He had to leave immediately otherwise he might have missed his flight. </p>
<p> BREAK DOWN </p>
<p> to stop working (a machine, a vehicle) </p>
<p> Example: Our car broke down on the way to Nice, so we phoned breakdown recovery service. </p>
<p> START OFF </p>
<p> to begin a journey at a particular place </p>
<p> Example: We started off in Heidelberg, which is this old-fashioned, nice town in Western Germany. </p>
<p> PUT SOMEONE UP </p>
<p> to give (someone) temporary accommodation </p>
<p> Example: My friends put me up for three nights. </p>

<p> The first conditional is a really useful English grammar structure for talking about future possibilities. </p>
<p> If you watch this video, you'll see lots of first conditional examples. Hey - we just used a first conditional there! It's such a useful structure! </p>
<p> First conditionals have two clauses: the condition and possible result. We'll show you how to form them, make negatives and questions, punctuate them and reverse the order. You'll learn about a common mistake and the different modal verbs you can use. </p>
<p> And very importantly, you'll see lots of examples of the first conditional in action in a funny spy story. </p>

<p> Summary: Conditional Sentences and Mixed Conditionals </p>
<p> Elicitation: Zero Conditional – We use the zero conditional to talk about things which are always or generally true, or things which always happen as a result of something else. – Example: If I’m late, my boss gets angry. </p>
<p> Elicitation: Second Conditional – We use the second conditional to talk about present or future hypothetical situations and their present or future consequences. – Example: If I were rich, I’d buy a new car. </p>
<p> Elicitation: First Conditional – We use the first conditional to talk about possible present or future situations and their future consequences. – Example: If my holiday request gets approved, I’ll go to Thailand. </p>
<p> Elicitation: Third Conditional – We use the third conditional to talk about past hypothetical situations and their past consequences. – Example: If I had taken a taxi, I wouldn’t have missed my flight. </p>
<p> Elicitation: Mixed Third + Second Conditional – If clause (third conditional about the past) + result clause (second conditional about the present or future) – We use this to talk about past hypothetical situations and their present or future consequences. – Example: If I hadn’t missed my plane, I wouldn’t be in this situation! </p>
<p> Elicitation: Mixed Second + Third Conditional – If clause (second conditional about something which is always true) + result clause (third conditional about the past) – We use this to talk about hypothetical situations which are always true and their past consequences. – Example: If I weren’t so careless, I wouldn’t have lost my wallet. </p>
<p> Forms: Generic Form: – If clause + result clause, or – Result clause + if clause </p>
<p> Zero Conditional – If + any present tense, + any present tense. – Most common form: If + present simple, + present simple. </p>

<p> Mixed Second & Third Conditional – Second conditional (always true) + third conditional (past) – If + past simple / past continuous, + present perfect / present continuous (would) </p>
<p> Other Information: – Using “unless” to replace “if”. – Using future time clauses to replace “if” in first and zero conditionals. – Using imperatives in the result clause. – Using modal verbs in either clause. </p>
<p> Imperatives & Modal Verbs - First & Zero Conditionals: – Elicitation from students. – Any first or zero conditional sentence with an imperative or a modal verb in the result clause is both a first and zero conditional sentence. – Example: If you go on holiday, don’t forget your wallet. (Imperative) – Example: If you go on holiday, you should remember to bring your wallet. (Modal verb) – Both these sentences are both first and zero conditionals. </p>
<p> Comparison using example sentence: – Zero conditional: If I eat too much, I get sick. – First conditional: If I eat too much, I will get sick. – Second conditional: If I ate too much, I would get sick. – Third conditional: If I had eaten too much, I would have gotten sick. – Mixed third and second conditional: If I had eaten too much, I would be sick right now/later. – Mixed second and third conditional: If I always ate too much, I would have gotten sick a long time ago. </p>

<p> TRANSCRIPT </p>
<p> Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's video I'm going to talk about something I love, and that is travel. So, if you like travelling too, if you're planning on going on a vacation, or if you know somebody who's travelling, this video will be very, very helpful to you. In this video I'm going to teach you some very important verbs. They're all phrasal verbs, and I'll explain what a phrasal verb is in a moment. So, these are all verbs that we use when we're talking about travel. Okay. </p>
<p> So, to get started, I wanted to tell you a little bit about phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb? One of the difficulties students have with English are verbs where you have a verb and a preposition. So, when you see a verb and a preposition together, that's a phrasal verb. Now, you might be thinking: "What's a preposition?" Good question. I'm going to give you an example. We have here four words, each of these is a phrasal verb. They all have the verb "get": "get in", "get up", "get on", "get over", and there's many more, "get away". There's tons of them. Each of these actually can have multiple meanings, too. So, one of the most difficult parts about English is learning phrasal verbs, because this, the blue part is the preposition, it can change the meaning of the verb. Okay? So, prepositions are words like: "on", "off", "up", "down", "toward", "over", "away", these types of words are prepositions. So, you'll notice with phrasal verbs, they're very, very common in conversation. They're... You can write them down, too, but in general, when people talk they often use phrasal verbs. Okay? So, they're very, very important, especially when you're talking about going on a trip with your friends or family. </p>
<p> So let's look at some of the common phrasal verbs we use when we're talking about trips. The first verb I want to teach you: "Drop off". Okay? So: "drop" is the verb, "off" is the preposition, together: "drop off" is a phrasal verb. What does this mean: "drop off"? When you "drop someone off" it means you're taking them to a place and then you leave them there. So, for example, maybe your friend needs to go to the airport, so you drive them to the airport and you drop them off at the airport. This means you take them there and you leave them in that place. Okay? So they don't come home with you; they stay there. So, for example, I have a friend named Frank, and when Frank goes travelling: "We drop Frank off at the airport." So, we drive Frank to the airport, he has all his luggage, his suitcases, and then we say to Frank: "Goodbye, Frank, you know, have a nice trip." We drop Frank off at the airport. You can also use "drop off" in a lot of other situations. For example, when you were a child maybe your parents, your mom or your dad, or maybe your grandparents dropped you off at school. This means that they took you to school, and then once you got to school, they would say goodbye to you and they would leave. So: "drop off" means you take someone to a place, and then you leave them there. You'll also notice... So, I have here the verb and the preposition. "Frank" is a name of a person and it's in the middle of "drop" and "off". Okay? So, these two are not together. We drop somebody off at the airport. Okay? So, sometimes with phrasal verbs... For some phrasal verbs you actually separate them, and you can put the names of somebody between them; for other ones you can't do that. For this one: "drop off", you put the name between the two... Between the verb and the preposition. </p>
<p> So, now let's look at another example of a common phrasal verb. "See off". Okay? So, again, we have "off" in both of these. "See off" is when... It's similar to "drop off", but it's a little bit different. Sometimes your family or your friends are going away for a long time, maybe they're going on a vacation or a trip, so you want to "see them off". It means you want to say goodbye to them at the airport, at the train station, maybe at their house. So, it's that goodbye you say before somebody goes off on a vacation. Okay? So, for example: "We see Frank off." Frank is going to Australia, so we go to the airport because we want to say goodbye to Frank, so: "We see Frank off" is another way to say: "We say goodbye to Frank when he goes on his trip." </p>

<p> What would you do if you had a million dollars? Where would you go if you could travel anywhere? </p>
<p> The answer to these questions - the 2nd Conditional. We use these "if" statements to talk about hypothetical situations. These sentence are frequently used in English, so it's important that we use them correctly. </p>

<doc id="file15566523" filename="what-if-how-to-use-the-conditional-in-english" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.eurocentres.com/blog/what-if-how-to-use-the-conditional-in-english">
<p> What If? How to Use the Conditional in English </p>
<p> We’re not always completely certain about our plans for the future, are we? </p>
<p> There’s always a lot of “what ifs”, “maybe’s” and “perhaps” in life! </p>
<p> And to express this in English, we use the conditional form – read on to find out more about the different types of this! </p>
<p> Zero conditional </p>
<p> This is a form of the conditional that actually doesn’t have any uncertainty to it – you use this when there is a condition for something, which is based on an absolute fact. </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<p> “If you don't drink enough water, you get thirsty.” </p>
<p> To put this together, you use the present simple tense to describe both the condition and the fact, with the word “if” at the start. You can also use “if” in between the two statements: </p>
<p> “Water turns into ice if you freeze it.” </p>
<p> First Conditional </p>
<p> What if you are expressing something where there is a very real possibility of it taking place? </p>
<p> This may be something that will probably happen in the near future – for example, if you have made some plans for later in the day, which may depend on a particular condition to happen. </p>
<p> Let’s take a look at an example: </p>
<p> “If I complete all my work today, I will go for a hike in the hills.” </p>
<p> The condition part of the sentence is still described using the present simple tense, but the result is expressed as something that could happen in future, by using “will” followed by the base form of the verb. </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<p> “If she passes her driving test, her father will buy her a new car.” </p>
<p> You can also use other words instead of “will”, including “shall”, “can” or “may”, to give slightly different meanings. </p>
<p> Second Conditional </p>
<p> Like the first conditional, you use this form when you are describing something that could happen in the future. But unlike the first form, this one is used when it’s not at all likely for the condition to be fulfilled! </p>
<p> Let’s take a look at an example: </p>
<p> “If I won the lottery, I would take all my friends on a huge holiday.” </p>
<p> Even though we are still talking about a possible future event, in this case, we use the past simple to describe the condition, and the word “would” to describe the result. </p>
<p> Third Conditional </p>
<p> Like the second conditional form, this one is also about describing something that is not possible to happen. </p>
<p> But the difference here is that you are describing something that could have happened in the past, while the second conditional described something that could take place in the future. </p>
<p> For example: </p>
<p> “If I had a bought a ticket that day, I would have won a prize.” </p>
<p> You use the past perfect tense to describe the condition in this form, and “would have” followed by the past participle to describe the result. </p>
<p> Sometimes you can also use “could have” or “should have” instead. </p>
<p> Your turn </p>
<p> Conditionals can seem a little complicated, but with some regular practice, you’ll soon get the hang of using them! Keep practicing them by reading and writing different examples as often as you can – try to come up with one example of each form of the conditional! </p>

will + infinitive

First vs. Zero Conditional

We use the present simple tense to talk about the
possible future condition. We use WILL + base verb to
talk about the possible future result. The important
thing about the first conditional is that there is a real
possibility that the condition will happen.
a) She'll be late if the train is delayed.
b) She'll miss the bus if she doesn't leave soon.
c) If I see her, I'll tell her.
Sometimes, we use shall, can, or may instead of will:
d) If you are good today, you can watch TV tonight.
e) If you finish your report tonight, you will be able to
hand it in tomorrow.

WHEN/AS SOON AS/UNLESS

The first conditional describes a particular situation,
whereas the zero conditional describes what
happens in general.
Zero conditional:
If you sit in the sun, you get burned. (here I'm talking
about every time a person sits in the sun - the burning
is a natural consequence of the sitting)
First conditional:
If you sit in the sun, you'll get burned. (here I'm talking
about what will happen today, another day might be
different)
10

WHEN

It is possible to use other words instead of if in first
conditional sentences:
WHY USE IT?

MAIN CLAUSE

It's used to talk about things which might happen in
the future. Of course, we can't know what will happen
in the future, but this describes possible things, which
could easily come true.
a) If it rains, I won't go to the park.
b) If I study today, I'll go to the party tonight.
c) If I have enough money, I'll buy some new shoes.

<p> Zero and First Conditionals </p>
<p> We use conditionals to describe the result of something that might happen in the present or in the future. </p>
<p> They usually involve the use of ‘if’ statements. An if-clause expresses a condition, while the main clause expresses the result. Here’s a typical structure of all conditional sentences: </p>
<p> The Zero Conditional </p>
<p> Zero conditionals are used to talk about facts, such as scientific facts, or when the result of the condition is always true. </p>
<p> If you heat ice, it melts. </p>
<p> [If + Present Simple, ….. + Present Simple] </p>
<p> The Present Simple is used in both clauses of the statement. </p>
<p> Conditional sentences can be used with other terms instead of ‘if’ such as ‘when’. </p>
<p> The use of ‘when’ also adds certainty to something happening. </p>
<p> When the monsoon arrives, it floods the streets. </p>
<p> [When + Present Simple, ….+ Present Simple] </p>
<p> The First Conditional </p>
<p> Unlike the zero conditional that are generally or almost always true, the first conditional could be associated with possible situations or a possibility of something that is about to happen in the future. </p>
<p> This could be based on an event that is changing at present or could depend on other events that might happen in the future. </p>
<p> In this case, ‘will’ is used in the second clause of the statement. </p>
<p> Example 1: </p>
<p> If my mother comes home tonight, I will take her out to dinner </p>
<p> Or </p>
<p> If my other comes home tonight, I’ll take her out to dinner. </p>
<p> [If + Present Simple, ….. + will + infinitive] </p>
<p> In the above two conditional types, it is not important whether ‘if’ is placed in the first clause of the statement or the second clause. They mean the same thing and can be swapped in usage. </p>
<p> If I go the market, I buy my groceries. </p>
<p> I buy my groceries if I go to the market. </p>
<p> OR </p>
<p> When I see my personal tutor, I discuss my problems with him. </p>
<p> I discuss my problems with my personal tutor when I see him. </p>
<p> Let’s compare these two types of conditional sentences: </p>

<p> How To Use Zero Conditional And First Conditional Clauses In English: Quiz + Audio Lesson </p>
<p> Hello, I'm Jane at DailyStep English. </p>
<p> This free quiz and audio lesson will help you learn how to use First and Zero Conditional Clauses correctly. Even advanced learners sometimes make mistakes to check your understanding here. If you are new to DailyStep English - welcome! You can sign up here for 5 Free Audio Lessons and to be on my mailing list. </p>
<p> Conditional sentences have a main clause and a conditional clause. There are five types of conditional sentences in English. Today we are going to look in detail at two of these types: Zero Conditional and First Conditional. </p>
<p> ZERO CONDITIONAL </p>
<p> We use this for scientific facts and for general truths, in other words, for things which are always true. The structure is: </p>
<p> Conditional clauses often start with the conjunction IF, but conditionals can also start with other conjunctions, such as AS LONG AS or UNLESS. Here are some examples: </p>
<p> This last conjunction, UNLESS means ‘IF… NOT’ so it has a negative meaning. </p>
<p> In Zero Conditionals only, we can also use WHEN as a conjunction. So we can say: </p>
<p> When it is warm, I go for a walk every day. When you heat ice, it melts. </p>
<p> So, what is the difference between these conjunctions? </p>
<p> PROVIDED, PROVIDED THAT and PROVIDING are more formal. They are often used in Business, Academic and Legal English. </p>
<p> AS LONG AS and SO LONG AS are more emphatic. So they emphasise the condition, and these sentences sound stronger. </p>
<p> WHEN and IF are more general. </p>
<p> Now, make your own sentences like these, and make sure they are true to your own life as this will help you to remember them better. You can learn to speak, write and understand conditional sentences in DailyStep Audio Lessons, from Levels 3 to 5. In my next blog on DailyStep English, I will cover SECOND and THIRD CONDITIONALS. </p>

<p> Zero conditional (if) </p>
<p> Introduction </p>
<p> We use the zero conditional to describe the result of an action when the result is always or usually the same, for example: </p>
<p> general facts or truths </p>
<p> habits or routines </p>
<p> to give instructions or make suggestions </p>
<p> Examples </p>
<p> If you add salt to water, it boils at a higher temperature. </p>
<p> I listen to music when I travel by train. </p>
<p> If you go to London, use public transport instead of taxis. </p>
<p> Form </p>
<p> The zero conditional has two clauses: the conditional clause and the main clause. Conditional clause This clause describes the action or condition that makes the main clause true. We can use "when" or "if": </p>
<p> "when": it will happen "When I go on holiday ..." (I will have a holiday – I am sure.) </p>
<p> "if": it might happen "If I go on holiday ..." (I might have a holiday – I'm not sure.) </p>
<p> We can use any form of present tense in English in the conditional clause, for example: </p>
<p> present simple "When I go on holiday, I go somewhere warm." </p>
<p> present continuous "If I’m reading a book, I wear glasses." </p>
<p> present perfect "When I’ve finished work, I go to the gym." </p>
<p> Main clause This clause describes the result of the conditional clause. We use the present simple and the imperative: </p>
<p> present simple: </p>
<p> for a general fact, habit or routine "If I take the train, I buy a newspaper." We can use adverbs to describe how usual the result is: "If I take the train, I often buy a newspaper. </p>
<p> imperative: </p>
<p> for suggestions or instructions "If you have time, come to my house." "When you get to the main road, turn right." </p>
<p> Order The order of the clauses does not matter: the meaning is the same. </p>
<p> If we put the conditional clause before the main clause, we use a comma to separate the clauses: "When" / "If" + present tense, present simple "When Sarah goes to London, she doesn’t take her car." </p>
<p> We don't use a comma if we put the main clause before the conditional clause: present simple + "when" / "if" + present tense "Sarah doesn’t take her car when she goes to London." </p>
<p> Practice </p>
<p> Complete the sentences with the correct form of the verb in brackets: </p>
<p> When David is working, he to music. (listen) </p>
<p> I usually order Chinese food if I home late. (get) </p>
<p> James and Peter shopping when they are on holiday. (not like) </p>
<p> If I early for work, the trains are less crowded. (leave) </p>

<p> "when": succederà "When I go on holiday ..." (Andrò in vacanza - sono sicuro.) </p>
<p> "if": potrebbe succedere "If I go on holiday ..." (Potrei andare in vacanza - non sono sicuro.) </p>
<p> Possiamo usare qualsiasi forma di tempo presente in inglese nella subordinata condizionale, per esempio: </p>
<p> present simple "When I go on holiday, I go somewhere warm." </p>
<p> present continuous "If I’m reading a book, I wear glasses." </p>
<p> present perfect "When I’ve finished work, I go to the gym." </p>
<p> Proposizione principale Questa frase descrive il risultato della subordinata condizionale. Usiamo il present simple e l'imperativo: </p>
<p> present simple: </p>
<p> per un fatto generale, un'abitudine o una routine "If I take the train, I buy a newspaper." Possiamo usare avverbi per descrivere quanto è comune il risultato: "If I take the train, I often buy a newspaper. </p>
<p> imperativo: </p>
<p> per suggerimenti o istruzioni "If you have time, come to my house." "When you get to the main road, turn right." </p>
<p> Se mettiamo la subordinata condizionale prima della proposizione principale, usiamo una virgola per separare le frasi: "When" / "If" + present tense, present simple "When Sarah goes to London, she doesn’t take her car." </p>
<p> Non usiamo la virgola se mettiamo la proposizione principale prima della subordinata condizionale: present simple + "when" / "if" + present tense "Sarah doesn’t take her car when she goes to London." </p>

<p> Zero and First Conditional Exercises and Examples with Video </p>
<p> Zero and First Conditional Exercises and Examples with Video </p>
<p> How do you know when to use zero conditionals or first conditionals in English? Are you even sure what zero and first conditional sentences are? Here is an explanation, video along with a zero and first conditional exercise to help you. </p>
<p> Examples of Zero Conditional Sentences </p>
<p> Zero conditional sentences are used to make imperative statements and statements of fact, such as: </p>
<p> If the temperature is below o Celsius, water freezes. </p>
<p> If it rains, we’ll get wet. </p>
<p> If today is Friday, tomorrow is Saturday. </p>
<p> If you don’t have money, you can’t buy anything. </p>
<p> Examples of First Conditional Sentences </p>
<p> First conditional sentences are used to talk about real or probable situations, for instance: </p>
<p> If I go out for dinner, I will order a cheeseburger. </p>
<p> If we don’t have money, we can borrow some. </p>
<p> If it rains, I won’t go to the baseball game. </p>
<p> If I eat anymore cheeseburgers, I’m going to be sick. </p>
<p> If I get sick, I won’t go to the movie tonight. </p>
<p> Still not sure? Don’t worry! We can help you understand with this week’s video and exercise. Learning how to form these more complex sentences will help you express more complicated ideas in English. </p>
<p> Zero or First Conditional Video: </p>
<p> Zero and First Conditional Exercises </p>
<p> Complete the conditional sentences below in comments, and we will respond. Remember to add a modal verb if the sentence is first conditional. </p>
<p> Example: If we (to go) ___ to the grocery store, I _______ (to buy) milk. = If we go to the grocery store, I will buy milk. </p>
<p> 1. If you go to the grocery store, ___ (to buy) me some vodka. </p>
<p> 2. If I talk to your dad, I ______ (ask) him to call you. </p>
<p> 3. If plants don’t have water, sunlight and soil, they ____ (to die). </p>
<p> 4. If I leave work early, we _____ (to go) to the movies. </p>
<p> 5. If you have the time, ___ (to call) your mother. </p>
<p> Now try writing a zero conditional and a first conditional sentence of your own. </p>
<p> 4. If I leave work early, we can go to the movies. (first conditional) </p>
<p> 5. If you have the time, call your mother. (zero conditional) </p>
<p> (first conditional) If it rains, you’ll better take an umbrella. </p>
<p> (zero conditional) When you come home, close the window. </p>
<p> LOIEnglish </p>
<p> YM nice work. You have some problems with number five. If it rains you’ll better take an umbrella. ‘YOU HAD’ is a false modal verb. It cannot be used with ‘WILL’ The correction is: If it rains you HAD BETTER take an umbrella. </p>
<p> Luiz </p>
<p> If you write a clause starting with when, wouldn’t it be a “time” clause? Of course, you use the same verb tense sequence, but you can’t say it is a conditional, can you? </p>
<p> iara </p>
<p> 1. If you go to the grocery store, You will buy me some vodka. 2. If I talk to your dad, I will ask him to call you. 3.If plants Don’t have water, sunlight and soil, they will die. 4.If I leave work early, we will go to the movies. 5.If you have the time, you will call you mother. </p>
