<p> Fastest Roast Turkey </p>
<p> Here is a turkey for when time and oven space are at a premium. The bird is butchered before cooking, its backbone removed (a technique called spatchcocking) and its legs separated, increasing the amount of surface area exposed to the oven's heat and decreasing the amount of cooking time dramatically. The overall height of the turkey also comes down, so two turkeys may fit in the oven, or one turkey and a baking pan filled with dressing. As with a whole bird, you should tent the meat with foil when it has finished cooking, and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes before serving. </p>
<p> Note: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation. It should not be considered a substitute for a professional nutritionist’s advice. </p>
<p> Preparation </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place the turkey on a cutting board with its breast side down, and using a very sharp knife or cleaver, cut out the bird's backbone. </p>
<p> Turn the turkey over and use your knife or cleaver to remove the legs and thighs. Press down on the turkey breasts to flatten the carcass. </p>
<p> Place the turkey parts in one large roasting pan. Tuck between them onion, celery pieces, and, if using, herbs, and shower with salt and pepper. Dot turkey pieces with pats of butter. </p>
<p> Place pan in a 450 degree oven for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 325 degrees and baste with accumulated juices. </p>
<p> Start to check the temperature of the breast and the thigh meat roughly 15 minutes later, and remove them from the oven when they have reached 165 degrees. As with a whole bird, you should tent the meat with foil and allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes. </p>

<p> Welcome to USA TODAY NETWORK’S EUROPEAN UNION EXPERIENCE </p>
<p> Zeppoli’s Sicilian Barbecues: An Italian summer tradition in Collingswood </p>
<p> Jenn Hall Special to the Cherry Hill Courier-Post </p>
<p> Updated 4:15 AM EST Dec 11, 2019 </p>
<p> Family and friends of chef Joey Baldino enjoy a special Sicilian style meal prepared at Zeppoli in Collingswood, N.J. </p>
<p> Joe Lamberti/Courier Post </p>
<p> In Sicily, come summertime, the most memorable meals are taken al fresco amid fields and groves that offer up their bounty. By day, an aggressive sun presses down and nourishes the crops, white hot until dusk’s reprieve. The slender leaves that adorn olive branches frame a tumble of mountains in the distance. </p>
<p> Viewed from afar, the landscape is all green earth and blue sky and the rugged geometry that defines this Italian island. Look closer, however, and the season’s jewel tones pop: yellow and green citrus early on, lipstick-red tomatoes and violet plums later. </p>
<p> In South Jersey, of course, we lack groves heavy with olives. </p>
<p> Yet Chef Joey Baldino has been crafting a cuisine in Sicily’s image since opening Zeppoli in 2011, just like in the Sicilian countryside, where he once spent close to half a year studying at the revered Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school. It was a supplement to formal training at The French Culinary Institute, and an experience that shaped his vision for the restaurant. </p>

<p> Joe Lamberti/Courier Post </p>
<p> Spanning 13 Mondays, the barbecues held in Zeppoli’s rear courtyard are an homage to the island that his father’s family once called home. “If you were in Sicily, this is how you would eat,” Baldino says. “A lot of food, family style. It’s a party.” </p>
<p> Attendance at this particular party, however, requires luck. This year, the series sold out in seven minutes — though it helps to know someone, or to know their grandmother, for that matter. </p>
<p> On an August evening, extended family on the chef’s mother’s side gather between an arbor thick with concord vines and the kitchen garden. The Diciccos are the part of Baldino’s family from Calabria — the part whose heritage informed the original Palizzi Social Club in South Philly 100 years back — but they find ample echoes of Southern Italy here. </p>
<p> “I wouldn’t do what I do if it wasn’t for my family,” the chef muses as he pulls a pair of brined chickens off a fire-hot spit, ash floating like summer snow. “All of this is for them.” </p>
<p> By that, he means his work at Zeppoli and also at his recent revival of the social club, to much fanfare in local and national press. The latter evokes his maternal roots and South Philly upbringing, always in and out of the Italian Market, always in and out of the club packed with elders. </p>
<p> As for Zeppoli? That’s a story about his travels, about a connection to his father Antony’s family forged through food. </p>
<p> “If you were in Sicily, this is how you would eat,” Zeppoli chef Joey Baldino says. “A lot of food, family style. It’s a party.” </p>
<p> “The club is more like Grandpop’s place. It’s more of an Italian-American spot, where you would see old guys smoke cigars. This place is more like Grandmom’s spot. It’s more composed dishes, a little bit more of a delicate atmosphere,” Baldino says. “They’re two totally different places for me. I love them both equally and try to split my time into both, but this is my first and will always be a special place.” </p>
<p> It’s a concise vision. Across two restaurants, two states and two continents, everything Baldino does is about honoring tradition. </p>

<p> Respect for tradition </p>
<p> As the Dicicco family sips lemonade perfumed with orange blossom water and star anise, Chef Baldino works a rotisserie grill, stoking flame. He is quick to smile as his cousins pass by, yet fully consumed by his work. </p>
<p> The meal that is about to unfold takes three days to prepare. </p>
<p> “The chicken gets brined. The pig gets cured. Things take a long time. I go to the fish market in the morning and pick out the fish for this myself,” Baldino explains. Samuel and Sons serves up a gorgeous spread, saline candy for a passionate chef. Then there’s the Italian Market, where longtime vendors like Claudio’s Specialty Foods and Giordano’s Fruit & Produce bring Italy’s bounty to his fingertips. </p>

<p> “People have been making certain things for hundreds of years,” Baldino says. Caciocavallo cheese. Ricotta. “If I want a really good ricotta cheese, I’m going to go to the cheesemaker, Mancuso, who’s been making his ricotta for centuries. His great-grandfather taught him.” </p>
<p> Respect for tradition has defined Baldino’s career, allowing him to connect with a culinary history that is his birthright. Sicilian cuisine evokes the island’s history as a crossroads, Greek grilling techniques married to Arab and North African flavors, French and Spanish influences intersecting native ingredients. As a result, the food differs markedly from that in other Italian regions, rich with citrus, seafood and fragrant wild herbs. </p>
<p> Most evocative for Baldino is the wild fennel that perfumes the Sicilian countryside. As the grill sends oak-tinged smoke skyward, he recalls its prevalence when he studied under Fabrizia Lanza, Anna Tasca Lanza’s daughter and culinary heir. “The very first day we got off the plane, she made me go into the field and pick wild fennel. That was my very first experience there. My hands smelled like fennel the whole day.” </p>

<p> Worn copies of the women’s cookbooks have pride of place in Zeppoli’s basement library, akin to bibles for the chef. “I was trained in a French school, but for me, it all came together when I was in Sicily. That’s what this restaurant is about. It’s about educating the customers about the island, about the people that live there, about my culture and about the food.” </p>
<p> Breads and salads </p>
<p> Appropriate to Sicily’s history, the five-course dinner (not counting dessert) begins with bread and an ingredient most often associated with Iberia: a baccala (salt cod) salad with vibrant pops of capers, garlic and celery. (Among a wave of influencers — Arab, Greek, French and mainland Italian among them — the Spanish ruled Sicily for several centuries.) It is served with flatbread-thin pane di musica, named for the method of its preparation. </p>
<p> “It’s so thin that the guys who play the piano could see through it,” Baldino explains. </p>

<p> Joe Lamberti/Courier Post </p>
<p> Such stories are brought to the table by a five-year veteran of Zeppoli’s waitstaff, Rachel Costello. She and Baldino work in a practiced dance that comes only through ample time spent together on the restaurant floor. </p>
<p> Costello will soon be leaving, committing full time to her other career as a ninth-grade literature teacher in West Philly. One can tell that these evenings under the stars will be missed. </p>
<p> “Joe is a really down-to-earth guy, and I think that’s what you see in his food: simple dishes, basic ingredients. There’s nothing hidden,” Costello says. “There’s something about a chef that can do the best with what’s around them.” </p>

<p> Joe Lamberti/Courier Post </p>
<p> There’s little time to wax poetic, however. More dishes need shepherding. </p>
<p> A quartet of salads is stunning by virtue of their careful simplicity. Broccoli is charred dark and dressed with a touch of anchovy, Abruzzi olive oil and pecorino pepato, the sharp cheese flecked with black peppercorns. Grilled octopus is paired with Sicilian olives, lemon, and salsa verde with parsley and capers. Melon is wrapped in prosciutto and served with plump figs. </p>
<p> The crowd favorite is the caciocavallo. The young, sheep’s milk cheese is baked al forno (in the oven) and drizzled over grilled semolina with blistered cherry tomatoes in red, orange and yellow. In Sicily, they hang the bulb-shaped cheese over fire to cook. As it grows soft, a hole is punctured in the bottom and it oozes onto the bread. </p>
<p> “Joe is a really down-to-earth guy, and I think that’s what you see in his food: simple dishes, basic ingredients. There’s nothing hidden,” Zeppoli server Rachel Costello says. “There’s something about a chef that can do the best with what’s around them.” </p>
<p> Costello delivers the dish to the table deeming it “the best grilled cheese you’ve ever had in your life.” This is appropriate. Cheesemaking has been a part of Sicilian culture since ancient times, with caciocavallo mentioned by Hippocrates in the fifth century BC. </p>
<p> A pasta course is placed on the table for a special Sicilian style barbecue at Zeppoli in Collingswood, N.J. </p>
<p> Joe Lamberti/Courier Post </p>
<p> Spiedini, pasta and mains </p>
<p> As the salad course is cleared, on come the spiedini: swordfish, scallops and head-on shrimp grilled over fire. Drawing on Greek influences, spiedini means skewered. “Anything on skewers, that’s real Sicilian,” Baldino says. “You see it on the street when you’re over there.” </p>
<p> This alone could serve as a fine coda to the meal. Yet pasta arrives next. Deeply Sicilian, cucuzza unites penne and zucchini in a dish rich with handfuls of Zeppoli’s basil, pecorino pepato and golden egg yolks. </p>
<p> Then there’s “macaroni and crabs,” which is 100 percent Philly, if by way of Italy. “We cook it for three hours in red tomato sauce with basil and fresh blue crabs from Jersey. Every barbecue in Philly, that’s what we have.” </p>
<p> His family falls silent, winding spaghetti around their forks. More than most, perhaps, they understand the story of the meal. </p>

<p> Joe Lamberti/Courier Post </p>
<p> “We eat out a lot. We enjoy our food. And relative or not, he knows how to cook,” says James Dicicco. A cousin, he sees the barbecue as an elaborate version of the Sunday gatherings that take place in his own home. Recipes have been passed down between generations. Sauces simmer and carry intergenerational memories. </p>
<p> Seated at the head of the table, James’ father Mike, cousin to Baldino’s mother Regina, emphasizes just how important that is. “He keeps the tradition up, and I’m so proud of him that he does, because it’s the kind of thing that gets lost.” </p>
<p> His wife Susan concurs: “It’s all about being together with the family and eating,” she says, noting that Joey’s mom, one of Baldino’s primary influences, was in her wedding. “He has magic. He really does.” </p>
<p> This reminiscence is interrupted only by the entrees: the chickens, which smell faintly of sage, lemon and garlic; suckling pig raised in Lancaster County and roasted under coals for five hours; lamb chops marinated overnight in garlic, parsley, lemon, olive oil and a touch of rosemary and anchovy — an echo of the sea. </p>
<p> As people eat, an acoustic duo plays “Arrivederci Roma,” nostalgic and sweet. They play “Speak Softly, Love” and “That’s Amore.” Every so often, the Diciccos clap and burst into song. </p>
<p> “It’s a light meal,” the chef jokes, pleased as the pork cracklings evoke cheers. Watching his family recreate a scene that has played out in iterations over his lifetime, the chef seems fully in his element. </p>
<p> “I’m not trying to recreate the wheel. I want people to enjoy, to sing. This is what it’s about. This is what life’s about.” He gazes across the courtyard. “I just want to keep the tradition going. It’s in my blood. It’s what I love to do.” </p>

<p> Sweet Desserts and Fresh Fruit </p>
<p> A proper Sicilian feast concludes with fresh fruit. </p>
<p> With desserts pushed aside, including Zeppoli’s namesake fried pastry, this final course is delivered by the chef himself, who is met with applause. It’s piled high with grapes and apricots, with lychees, ground cherries and mamoncillo — also known as Spanish lime, though its origins are Latin American. To eat it, one peels away leathery, green skin and sucks sherbet-orange pulp from a large stone, the flavor like lime kissed by lychee. </p>
<p> It’s all too much, yet as with the rest of the meal, it’s hard to resist. </p>
<p> “I’m not trying to recreate the wheel. I want people to enjoy, to sing. This is what it’s about. This is what life’s about.” Joey Baldino gazes across the courtyard. “I just want to keep the tradition going. It’s in my blood. It’s what I love to do.” </p>
<p> Without anyone much noticing, night has overtaken the patio and the warm lights strung in the arbor gently Illuminate the scene. Overhead, stars shimmer, but no one looks up, deep in conversation and sipping house anisette. Echoing the exhale after an indulgent meal, a gentle breeze blows cool across the courtyard, welcome amid a string of humid days. </p>
<p> “There it is!” someone proclaims. It could be a snapshot from the Sicilian countryside: voices threaded, platters in various states of disarray and a group of kindred spirits delivered fully into the present tense. The chef’s work here is complete. </p>

<p> An impassioned Italian Scot sharing how to cook authentically, and travel with enthusiasm. </p>
<p> 10 Traditional and Authentic Italian Recipes — Passed Down Within my Family — (Cucina Povera) </p>
<p> I’d like to introduce you to 10 traditional and authentic Italian cucina povera recipes which have been passed down within my family. </p>
<p> As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. </p>
<p> What is Cucina Povera? </p>
<p> These are “cucina povera” style recipes, which essentially means “peasant food” (literally “poor cooking” or “poor kitchen”). </p>
<p> Since I shared a load of English and Scottish recipes when I was in those respective countries, I thought it would be nice to do the same with Italian recipes, given that I’m currently in Italy right now. I came to speak on a round table at the Turin Epicurean yearly event featuring everything from food to fashion. More to come on that soon! </p>
<p> Cucina Povera dishes are mostly always made using super simple recipes, containing a minimal of ingredients. Usually, the products and seasonal and locally grown. As you would probably guess, those ingredients must be the best quality. There’s nothing to hide the lack of flavor otherwise. </p>
<p> Cucina povera recipes are the antitheses of American “Italian” chain restaurant’s dishes. If you enjoy this type of menu, that’s totally fine, just know that there is essentially nothing on it that is truly Italian. </p>
<p> Traditional Italian food is not smothered in sauces, tons of cheese and/or “lots of herbs and spices”. Those are American concoctions. Authentic Italian dishes are mostly light, include lots of vegetables, very little cheese (even on pizza) and are very healthy/nutritious. </p>
<p> Most “Italian” recipes I see aren’t even remotely Italian </p>
<p> I get very upset seeing many bloggers sharing “Italian” recipes when they have made up a recipe including tomatoes and oregano on their own and call it “Italian”. People in the US also tend to think that Italian food is heavy and fattening. </p>
<p> It’s very frustrating as I’m trying to share and inform readers what REAL Italian-style food looks and tastes like. Cucina povera recipes fall under the classification of the Mediterranean diet which is extremely healthy and nutritious! </p>
<p> Since you may have never heard of or seen these dishes before, I’m adding a comment left by a reader below each photo. It may entice you to try something really new! </p>
<p> I hope you enjoy my family’s recipes: a true taste of Italy. (Click on the dish title for the full recipe.) </p>

<p> […] a restaurant I wanted to go to because their logo is, “Obsessively Authentic Italian.” If you know me, you know why I wanted to eat here! Mum and I were not disappointed; so yes, it’s Nonna […] </p>
<p> […] is simply, cooked corn meal, and it has always been a very popular dish in Italy. It’s really a “peasant” dish, and I make it the way my mother taught me, which is how her mother taught her, which I’m sure […] </p>
<p> Your recipes are straightforward and easy to follow. Kudos! They bring memories of my grandma. She made wonderful (fattening) chocolate cookies with walnuts in them for special occaaions .They were made with LARD. Lost her recipes in a house fire. If you or anyone has this please share. Blessings! </p>
<p> Hi Debbie! Thank you and I am so sorry to hear of the loss of your grandma’s recipes! That is something truly irreplaceable. I will ask on my Facebook page to see if anyone has a recipe that sounds similar. Can you give me any other info to go on? Were they an Italian cookie? American? Remember the shape they were made in? These would be helpful. Let me know! Christina </p>
<p> You must let me know if these are the cookies your grandma made because a friend just posted this recipe TODAY! The are Sicilian Chocolate and Clove Cookies (change out the butter for lard). Hope these are the ones you’re looking for, Debbie! CC </p>
<p> Debbie, did this Cookie have pepper in it. My mom made Italian chocolate pepper cookies with walnuts in them. The whole cookie was then glazed. Hope you find the recipe. </p>
<p> My husband and I currently have an Italian exchange student with us for the school year. He has been a real trooper and tried dozens of American dishes but I want to provide a little taste fo home for him too. He has raved over the dishes I have made and I love having a reference for authentic Italian recipes! </p>
<p> How lovely, Debbi! That’s so kind of you to make him food from home as well as your own dishes! Thank you so much for the note, it is soooo appreciated! CC </p>
<p> I love your recipes . I agree with so many others , recipes on the various cooking sites are just American- Italian dishes., Nothing to do with real Italian food. I enjoy your site so much because my mothers parents were from Italy. When they came to the united states and had their children they never passed down any Italian traditions, customs, recipes or language. Sometimes I feel the only way I know I am Italian is because I had my dna tested. I am exactly 50%. So my 50% thanks you so much for your recipes. </p>
<p> You have no idea how much your note means to me Sharyn. I am trying my hardest to share these authentic Italian recipes in hopes that people will give this type of food a chance, and it honestly seems like a useless endeavor. All the sites that use jars of awful sauces and bottles of “Italian dressing” and “Italian seasoning” which don’t even exist in Italy, are the ones that people want most. I want to tell them, “It’s just as easy to use REAL ingredients and less of them!” I’m so sorry that your parents and grandparents didn’t pass on their traditions in all aspects of life. As an immigrant, I feel it’s important to assimilate (speak the language of the country you move to, obey the laws and respect the new culture), but at home, I also think it’s important to pass on the ethnic traditions or, as you describe, they will be lost forever. </p>
<p> Thank you so much for your comments and I do hope you’re able to bring some “Italianità” into your life. Do you know what part of Italy your grandparents were from? </p>
<p> HI Christina, I completely agree with you when you say that many food bloggers offer Italian recipes in their own way when in reality they have not the slightest idea what Italian cuisine is. I’ve seen and read too many fake Italian recipes. I am Italian, and I cannot accept that the typical Italian recipes that are part of our history, our culture and tradition are so abused. I confess that the blood boils in my veins. So far you are the only food blogger who offers real Italian recipes. Well done, keep it up! </p>
<p> Thank you, Salvo! I appreciate your comment, however, there are many other authentic Italian food bloggers. One of my favorites is Frank at http://www.memoriediangelina.com. You will love his site, too! Grazie mille! CC </p>
<p> […] told him that I was trying to bring recipes like cucina povera to the US, and he was very happy to hear it! I’ve added a link for a video about Chef […] </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing the recipes passed down from your Italian parents. I just love Italian food. The dried zucchini with potatoes and pancetta looks great. I’m not a great cook myself, but I would love to find something like this in a restaurant. </p>
<p> When I was little my Mother always minestra with dandelions we picked ourselves. Then she would make polenta and fry it in a black frying pan, and it was great to dunk in greens. </p>
<p> you left out what in our family we referred to as “re zut” which I found later in life was rizzuto – spelling?? apparently it is a northern italy thing – our friends from Naples didn’t know what we were talking about. This was a staple with stewed chicken, dumplings etc. </p>
<p> Oh goodness, this is not even the tip of the iceberg, Marcia! This isn’t meant to be a comprehensive list, only a few recipes that I have on my site. I’ve never heard of that dish, but then again there will be hundreds and thousands of regional dishes across Italy like this. Sounds almost like “risotto”? </p>
<p> Love keeping up with your travel adventures and the wonderful recipes you share. My Mom, who turned 91 in April this year, comes from Rome. She met my Dad towards the end of World War ll, they married in August 1945 and she has been living in Cape Town, South Africa, since then. My late husband was Dutch so as you can well imagine keeping everyone happy at the dinner table was quite a challenge. All turned out fine. </p>
<p> Thanks so much for your note, Pat! What a wonderfully international family, I love it!! I can imagine you have quite the repertoire when it comes to the dinner menu. Hope you enjoyed some of these Italian recipes, too! :) </p>
<p> This is such a great collection of easy dishes. Such a great reminder that really delicious and healthy food doesn’t need to be complicated or time consuming! </p>
<p> What a lovely collection of old time recipes! Most of which I knew, but the dried zucchini is a new one for me. How I wish I knew about that a few years back when I was growing my own and didn’t know what to do with the incredible bounty… couldn’t give it away fast enough to keep up with the production! </p>
<p> Thank you, Frank! Oh yes, that’s such a great way to use a bounty of zucchini! Tastes so different when it’s rehydrated, too! Lovely treat in the winter! </p>
<p> You have the best Italian recipes! I am looking forward to new recipes after your Turin trip. So excited to hear about it. </p>
<p> I love so many of these, and know I will love all those I have yet to try! I am most excited about the homemade pancetta! This will be happening REALLY soon in our home! </p>
<p> I have always thought of Italian dishes as fattening Christina. Now I know they are not at all like the Italian meals served here and in the USA. I travelled in Greece and the food there is not like what we get in our Greek restaurants in Canada so I should have know this. I look forward everyday to reading about your food and travel adventures… </p>
<p> Thank you for saying this, Lindsay. It truly is sad to see the representation of most Italian food in the US, especially, and I’m glad you know now what it is supposed to be like! </p>
<p> All of these dishes look and sound amazing! I really love that dried courgette, pancetta and potato dish though, it’s sounds absolutely divine! </p>
<p> All of your recipes look delicious; however, your dried zucchini recipe really caught my attention. … drying zucchini is new to me. This is definitely something I look forward to trying this summer! </p>
<p> What delicious looking recipes – ALL of them. Christina, I am so with you on the authentic and using the best ingredients. Looking forward so much to hearing about your culinary trip to Turin – love seeing the ambience there on your social media. </p>

<p> Italian Chopped Salad </p>
<p> Tastes just like it came from a restaurant! Our Lightened-Up Italian Vinaigrette makes this delicious salad lighter in fat and calories than take-out. </p>
<p> ½ cup (125 mL) diced, cooked chicken </p>
<p> 1 tbsp (15 mL) crumbled blue cheese </p>
<p> Optional toppings: crumbled bacon or real bacon bits, sliced green onions </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Combine all the dressing ingredients in the Measure, Mix & Pour®. Mix until blended. </p>
<p> Spiralize the cucumber with the fettuccine blade on the Veggie Spiralizer. Place the noodles on a paper towel to pat dry. Reserve ½ cup (125 mL) of the cucumber noodles for the salad; reserve remaining for another use. </p>
<p> Assemble the salad layers in the Make & Take Mason Jar. Put the cucumber noodles at the bottom, then layer with tomatoes, pasta, avocado, and lettuce. When layering, occasionally tap the jar to settle the layers and allow for more room for filling. Top with chicken and optional ingredients. </p>
<p> Add 2 tbsp (30 mL) of salad dressing to the lid of the Make & Take Mason Jar; reserve the remaining dressing for another use. When you're ready to serve, add the cheese and dressing to the jar and shake to combine. </p>

<p> 1 servings </p>
<p> Nutrients per serving: </p>
<p> Cook's Tips: </p>
<p> Cooked chicken should be eaten within 3–4 days. If you're storing the salad in the jar for a couple of days, add your chicken the day you plan to eat it. To minimize browning of the avocado, squeeze a little lemon juice over it before layering. It’s best to eat salads with avocado within 1–2 days. Instead of ditalini pasta, you can use cooked quinoa or another small shaped pasta. </p>

<p> Fun with Food </p>
<p> 13 Unusual Food Traditions from Around the World </p>
<p> Posted by Paula Cilia on September 29, 2014 </p>
<p> When it comes to manners around the world each culture has adopted their own traditions and etiquette. Better not get caught rubbing your chopsticks or eating with a fork. Before you set out on a worldwide tour brush up on bizarre food trends with these 13 examples. </p>
<p> 1 of 13 </p>
<p> Thailand </p>
<p> <p>In Thailand, custom has labelled putting food to your mouth using a fork to be rude. A fork can only be used to help food onto a spoon and should not be used for your meal.</p> </p>
<p> 2 of 13 </p>
<p> Slurping Noodles </p>
<p> <p>For all you loud eaters out there Japan will welcome you with open arms. Slurping your noodles is not only acceptable in Japan but also welcome. Not only does it suggest a person can eat hot foods quicker but the Japanese believe it makes food taste better.</p> </p>
<p> 3 of 13 </p>
<p> Leaving Food On Your Plate </p>
<p> <p>Leaving an empty plate doesn&rsquo;t always mean good things! In China an empty plate means that the guest was not served enough food. In India and Japan leaving a clean plate lets the hosts know you&rsquo;ve enjoyed their meal.</p> </p>
<p> 4 of 13 </p>
<p> Eating With Your Hands </p>
<p> <p>Always use your right hand when eating Ethiopian food! Eating traditional cuisine requires scooping up the food onto flat bread with your hands&mdash;no utensils necessary!</p> </p>
<p> 5 of 13 </p>
<p> Chicago Hot Dogs </p>
<p> <p>It is unheard of to put anything but mustard on a Chicago dog; you will be exiled if you go against tradition! End of story!</p> </p>
<p> 6 of 13 </p>
<p> Chop Sticks </p>
<p> <p>Proper chopstick etiquette is major in China so much so there could be a rulebook! Never ever rest your chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice or wave chopsticks at another person.</p> </p>
<p> 7 of 13 </p>
<p> Grated Cheese </p>
<p> <p>It was blasphemous back in the day to ask anyone to top a seafood dish with grated Parmesan ask any Italian!&nbsp;The act of mixing seafood and cheese was unheard of. They obviously didn&rsquo;t get the memo that cheese is meant for everything!</p> </p>
<p> 8 of 13 </p>
<p> Pouring Drinks </p>
<p> <p>In Korean culture it is customary to never pour your own drink and wait or request someone else pour it for you.&nbsp;</p> </p>
<p> 9 of 13 </p>
<p> Pass The Gas </p>
<p> To all the gassy folks out there you’re gift is definitely worth something in some Inuit cultures. The act of flatulating is said to be a sign of appreciation after a good meal. </p>
<p> 10 of 13 </p>
<p> Salt and Pepper </p>
<p> <p>In Portugal asking for salt and pepper in a restaurant is a huge offence to the chef and his cooking abilities.</p> </p>
<p> 11 of 13 </p>
<p> Right Hand, Wrong Hand </p>
<p> In parts of the Middle East and India the right and left hands have specific jobs. The right hand is for picking up food and other things while the left is known to be responsible for “other” less edible things. When eating amongst a group in these cultures the right hand must always be used. </p>
<p> 12 of 13 </p>
<p> Sushi Grade </p>
<p> We’re all guilty of this; rubbing chopsticks together to rid of splinters. When in a sushi restaurant this is highly offensive and suggests that they are using low-end chopsticks. Rule of thumb: don’t rub your chopsticks together before eating! </p>
<p> 13 of 13 </p>
<p> Fork and Knife </p>
<p> <p>In Brazil eating with your hands is not acceptable and a fork and knife are a must. You must always use utensils even when eating a sandwich!</p><p><em>Paula Cilia is a Toronto-based freelance writer and lover of all things food and food related!&nbsp;</em></p> </p>

<doc id="file14874014" filename="2066-cut-resistant-gloves" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/2066-cut-resistant-gloves">
<p> Cut-Resistant Gloves </p>
<p> Published August 2019 </p>
<p> How we tested </p>
<p> If you’ve spent any time at all in the kitchen, there’s a good chance that at some point you’ve cut yourself while breaking down a chicken, skinned a knuckle grating cheese, or sliced a fingernail (or worse) using a mandoline. A sharp blade doesn’t discriminate; injuries are possible even for the most careful or experienced cooks. Made from high-tech engineered fabrics that are stronger than an equal weight of stainless steel, cut-resistant gloves promise to help protect your hands against accidental cuts, providing extra insurance against damage. </p>
<p> That said, there are limits to their powers. As the manufacturers of these gloves are all quick to declare, their products are cut-resistant but not cut-proof, meaning that they can’t entirely eliminate the possibility of you cutting yourself. In short, using a cut-resistant glove does not give you license to adopt reckless or unsafe practices in the kitchen. They’re also not puncture-resistant, so they’re not great for tasks where your hand might slip and cause you to jab yourself, as you might when shucking oysters. </p>
<p> Still, we liked the idea of having a bit more security when using sharp tools. It had been a while since we last reviewed these products, and we wanted to know if our favorite, the Microplane Cut Resistant Glove, held up to the competition. So we bought six models priced from about $5 to about $25 per glove, including our previous winner, and put them to the test, wearing them as we halved, pitted, and sliced avocados; grated soft cheese and carrots; and peeled potatoes and sliced them on a mandoline. Most models came as individual gloves rather than pairs, and were ambidextrous, so we could use them on our dominant or nondominant hand as the situation required; one model came as a pair, with dedicated right- and left-handed gloves. </p>
<p> Cut-Resistance Levels Don’t Matter </p>
<p> Cut-resistant gloves come in different levels of cut resistance, which are evaluated in the United States by an independent organization called the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The gloves in our lineup had ANSI cut scores that ranged from A3 (takes a weight of 1,000 grams or less to cut material with 20 millimeters of blade travel) to A7 (takes a weight of 4,000 grams or less). We tested these cut scores informally by stuffing Slim Jim Beef Jerky Sticks in the fingers of each glove and using fresh razor blades to cut across them with increasing levels of force; each glove held up to the cut score it claimed. </p>
<p> In the end, though, the cut-resistance level itself didn’t make a difference for the tasks we performed. We’re pleased to report that all of the gloves did a good job of keeping our fingers safe from harm. After cutting, grating, peeling, and slicing nearly 50 pounds of food, our hands were still intact, with not so much as a scratch on them. </p>
<p> Design and Fit Are Key </p>
<p> The gloves, however, were a different story. By the end of testing, some of them had holes in the fingers, or fibers that had been tugged loose when they caught on a blade. There was no correlation between damage and cut score or even thickness; thick and thin gloves were equally likely to get holes or snag, and both more and less cut-resistant gloves saw holes, too. </p>
<p> What determined the damage? The design of the glove, for starters. The gloves that tore were those that had excess fabric that extended too far beyond the users’ fingers and got stuck on grater or mandoline blades. While unattractive to look at, these loose threads and holes didn’t actually detract from the protection the gloves provided, since our fingers were safe below them. We were also relieved to find that any holes that were generated did not get significantly larger when we washed the gloves 10 times; the holes stayed about the same size from start to finish. </p>
<p> That said, the overly long gloves were also simply less pleasant to use. All that baggy, excess fabric got in the way not only of the blade, but of our hands themselves, limiting our dexterity and making it harder to get a secure grip on smaller or more slippery objects, like carrots or avocados. So, too, did gloves that were thicker; testers generally preferred gloves that were made with fabric that was 1.0 millimeter or less in thickness, and our winner was the thinnest, with fabric 0.8 mm thick. </p>
<p> As for fit, we preferred gloves that came in different sizes, as these accommodated different hand sizes and shapes better. Almost all manufacturers provide guides to help you find the size that is most likely to fit your hands, usually by providing palm and/or finger measurements. Our previous winner is only available in one size, so while it was great for people with smaller hands, those with larger hands were out of luck. </p>
<p> Ultimately, the best glove is the one that fits your hand the most closely. While hand sizes and shapes vary significantly from person to person, our favorite glove did the best job of accommodating different hands in all the various sizes that were offered. </p>
<p> Cleaning the Gloves </p>
<p> One last point: we also preferred gloves that were machine-washable. In part, this was because the machine did a better job of getting rid of the stains that marked every glove after we grated carrots or peeled potatoes. But also, we liked machine-washable gloves due to concerns about food safety—these gloves come into direct contact with any food we might process, so we prefer to be able to clean them more thoroughly. One glove fit most users’ hands nicely, but was covered in a rubbery substance that prohibited it from going in the washing machine, a deal breaker for most users. </p>
<p> Our Winning Cut-Resistant Glove is the Mercer Culinary MercerGuard Cut Glove </p>
<p> Our favorite cut-resistant glove is the Mercer Culinary MercerGuard Cut Glove. The thinnest glove we tested, it allows for superior dexterity and grip while still protecting our hands from harm—even after we used it to peel, grate, and mandoline an additional 20 pounds of cheese, fruit, and vegetables. It comes in lots of sizes, and did the best job of fitting different hands, though the bigger sizes run small, so medium- and large-handed testers might want to size up. And it’s machine-washable, so while it did stain somewhat over the course of testing, most of the marks faded after a few wash cycles. </p>
<p> Methodology </p>
<p> We tested six cut-resistant gloves priced from about $5 to about $25, using them on our dominant and nondominant hands as we halved, pitted, and sliced avocados; grated soft cheese and carrots; and peeled potatoes and then sliced them on a mandoline. Users with different hand sizes tried on gloves in the appropriate size category to assess fit, and we washed each of the gloves by hand or in the washing machine 10 times. Finally, for durability testing, we used the winner while peeling, grating, and using a mandoline to process an additional 20 pounds of food. </p>
<p> Rating Criteria </p>
<p> Dexterity: We evaluated how easy it was to move and grip foods with the gloves on </p>
<p> Protection: We assessed how well each glove protected our hands from harm </p>
<p> Design and Fit: We noted whether the glove came in different sizes, and evaluated how well gloves of different sizes (when offered) fit users with the appropriate hand sizes </p>
<p> Ease of Cleanup: We rated how easy it was to clean the gloves </p>

<p> The Results </p>
<p> Winner </p>
<p> Recommended </p>
<p> Design Trifecta 360 Knife Block </p>
<p> Admittedly expensive, this handsome block certainly seemed to live up to its billing as “the last knife block you ever have to buy.” The heaviest model in our testing, this block was ultrastable, and its durable bamboo exterior was a breeze to clean. Well-placed medium-strength magnets made it easy to attach all our knives, and a rotating base gave us quick access to them. One tiny quibble: The blade of our 12-inch slicing knife stuck out a little. </p>

<p> Buy Now </p>
<p> Recommended </p>
<p> Schmidt Brothers Downtown Block </p>
<p> This roomy block completely sheathed our entire winning knife set using just one of its two sides—and quite securely, thanks to long, medium-strength magnet bars. Heavy, with a grippy base, this block was very stable. An acrylic guard made this model extra-safe but also made it a little trickier to insert knives and to clean; the wood block itself showed some minor cosmetic scratching during use. </p>

<p> Buy Now </p>
<p> Schmidt Brothers Midtown Block </p>
<p> This smaller version of the Downtown Block secured all our knives nicely, though the blade of the slicing knife stuck out a bit. With a base lined with grippy material, this block was very stable. An acrylic guard afforded extra protection against contact with blades but made it a little harder to insert knives and to clean; the wood itself got a little scratched during use. </p>

<p> Buy Now </p>
<p> Recommended with Reservations </p>
<p> Swissmar Bamboo Magnetic Knife Block </p>
<p> This small, scratch-resistant model had a stable, rubber-lined base and could hold all our knives, though the blade of the 12-inch slicing knife stuck out a bit. But inch-long gaps between its small magnets made coverage uneven and forced us to find the magnetic hot spots in order to secure the knives. Its acrylic guard made it safer to use but harder to insert knives and to clean. </p>
<p> $49.93* </p>
<p> Not Recommended </p>
<p> Messermeister Walnut Magnet Block </p>
<p> This handsome block was done in by its shape—a tippy, top-heavy quarter-circle that wasn’t tall or broad enough to keep the blades of three knives from poking out. It lacked a nonslip base, and its extra-strong magnets made it unnerving to attach or remove our heavy cleaver. Finally, it got a bit scratched after extensive use. </p>
<p> $129.95* </p>
<p> Epicurean Standing Knife Rack 12" </p>
<p> This magnetic block sheathed all our knives completely, though with a bit of crowding. But it was hard to insert each knife without hitting the block’s decorative slats on way down, and because the block was light and narrow, it wobbled when bumped. Worse, we couldn’t take it apart, so splatters that hit the interior were there to stay. Additionally, the outside stained easily, and when we wiped it down, the unit smelled like wet dog. </p>
<p> $99.95* </p>
<p> Kapoosh Rondelle Knife Block </p>
<p> This model stabilized knives with a mass of stiff, spaghetti-like bristles that shed and nicked easily after extensive use, covering our knives with plastic debris. While all our knives fit securely, several of the blades stuck out, making this unit feel less safe overall. Finally, though the bristles could be removed and cleaned in the dishwasher, their nooks and crannies made this block hard to wash by hand. </p>
<p> $24.99* </p>
<p> Kuhn Rikon Vision Knife Block, Clear </p>
<p> This plastic block required us to aim each knife into the folds of an accordion-pleated insert that was removable for easy cleaning but got nicked easily with repeated use. Because we could only insert the knives vertically, longer knife blades stuck out; a cleaver was too wide to fit. The lightest model in our lineup, this block was dangerously top-heavy when loaded with knives. </p>

<p> Feast of the Seven Fishes: A rich tradition preserved in South Jersey </p>

<p> Grilled sardines with a salsa verde from chef Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood. </p>
<p> JOE LAMBERTI/COURIER POST-USA TODAY NETWORK NJ </p>
<p> On the night before Christmas, an array of seafood begins appearing on some dinner tables as a symbolic way to ring in the sacred holiday. </p>
<p> The tradition of abstaining from meat and eating fish before a holiday began centuries ago as a Roman Catholic practice in many parts of Italy, where the type and number of fish and the preparation vary by region. </p>
<p> However, the specifically named Feast of the Seven Fishes is an Italian-American tradition begun by Italian immigrants who left their mother country seeking jobs and prosperity in the U.S., according to culinary historians and chefs. </p>

<p> Very often on the bountiful menu are the traditional cod (baccala), whether fresh or rehydrated salted and dried cod; smelts; sardines; shrimp; octopus; clams; mussels, or others. The number should be at least seven — seven kinds of seafood in soups, appetizers and entrees or one or more seafood types prepared in seven different recipe dishes. </p>
<p> And not just Italian-American families but other lovers of seafood can enjoy the feast whether served at a restaurant or made at home. </p>
<p> SautŽed shrimp with garlic and parsley from chef Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood. </p>
<p> JOE LAMBERTI/COURIER POST-USA TODAY NETWORK NJ </p>
<p> At home for the holidays </p>
<p> Usually Chef Joey Baldino can be found cooking dinners with fresh ingredients at his intimate Italian restaurant Zeppoli on Collings Avenue in Collingswood or at the private Palizzi Social Club in South Philadelphia, but not on Christmas Eve. </p>
<p> Zeppoli, a BYOB with a southern Italian and Sicilian-style menu, will be closed that night because the seven-time semi-finalist of the James Beard culinary competition will share his Dec. 24 feast with his Italian family and friends at a cousin's home in South Philadelphia. </p>
<p> There, Baldino said they freshly prepare and devour a traditional "La Vigilia di Natale" (Christmas Eve) dinner, with seven or even more seafood dishes like fresh grilled sardines with salsa verde; whole, unpeeled shrimp flash-sauteed in sizzling olive oil with drippings and all poured over white cannellini beans, and cioppino, a seafood stew with broth. </p>
<p> Chef and owner Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood. </p>
<p> JOE LAMBERTI/COURIER POST-USA TODAY NETWORK NJ </p>
<p> "For me, I think the Seven Fishes custom is a sacred tradition that is best observed at home with family and friends," the 41-year-old Baldino said at Zeppoli before cleaning and cooking the shrimp and beans dish that also is a regular menu choice at Zeppoli, along with a seafood stew. Baldino's family comes from both Sicily and Calabria, and both regions influence his menus. </p>
<p> "My Aunt Mary always did all the cooking for 20 people and now my cousin Al, her son, does it since she passed on. I bring the fresh fish," he explains, adding he developed his love of cooking from his Calabrian aunt. </p>
<p> "For us, the baccala that night is salt and dried cod that we cook after soaking it for two days," the chief said. </p>
<p> Baldino said the immigrant tradition began more than 100 years ago when many Italians arrived in America although exactly where, when or which families started it remains a mystery. </p>
<p> And the number seven's importance also is up for discussion although that number— repeated in the Bible hundreds of times—may refer to one or more of the following: the seven sacraments, such as baptism and marriage; the seven virtues; the seven days of creation, or even the seven deadly sins. </p>
<p> 'Dinner at the Club' tells the story of the Palizzi Social Club by James Beard nominee Joey Baldino and co-author/food writer Adam Erace. </p>
<p> Running Press </p>
<p> Baldino devotes a section to the feast in his newly published, first cookbook, "Dinner at the Club: 100 Years of Stories and Recipes from South Philly's Palizzi Social Club," where he is the president. Co-authoring the book is food and travel writer Adam Erace, also of South Philly, who served for 10 years as restaurant critic for the Courier-Post. </p>
<p> Baldino is making an exception this year by agreeing to cook a special Seven Fishes feast in New York City but not on Christmas Eve. </p>
<p> Earlier: Zeppoli’s Sicilian Barbecues: An Italian summer tradition in Collingswood </p>
<p> The James Beard Foundation has invited Baldino and two chefs of a New York City restaurant to prepare the annual dinner at the Beard House in Manhattan on Dec. 17 to showcase global holiday cuisine . </p>
<p> "This year, we’ve invited seven-time Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic semi-finalist Joseph Baldino of Zeppoli and Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli of the lauded West Village hot spot Don Angie for their innovative, irresistible and sustainable take on this sacred Italian feast," the foundation said in a released statement. </p>
<p> Its programming director, Izabela Wojcik, said the Beard House has a long and rich history of celebrating the regionality of America’s cuisine and the chefs and restaurants behind that story. </p>
<p> "One of our favorite themes within that context is to showcase global holidays and traditions that connect diners to that regionality but that also speak to heritage and community. And of course December means the Italian-American Christmas tradition of the Feast of the Seven Fishes," she said, calling Baldino "such a talent.". </p>

<p> Seven Fishes for everyone </p>
<p> "You don't need to be Italian to throw a Seven Fishes dinner. Our neighborhood has become more diverse than ever and a lot of newcomers have adopted the tradition and made it their own," Baldino writes in his book. </p>
<p> Owner-chef Alberto Delbello of Il Portico Ristorante Italiano in Burlington City could not agree more. </p>
<p> "The seven-fish dinner is no longer just an Italian-American tradition but has become an American tradition to be enjoyed by anyone." he said. "And you can substitute tilapia or other more popular types of fish here for traditional ones like cod, or you can offer some meat choices as well because America is not all Italian." </p>
<p> His restaurant is among those offering the elaborate dinner at his price of $50 or higher at some restaurants. </p>
<p> One of the entrees on Delbello's menu of Roman-Jewish cuisine will be fettuccine with assorted seafood in a light tomato sauce. There will be six main entrees offered with one chicken dish for those who cannot or prefer not to eat seafood. </p>
<p> On Dec. 24, minestra di pesce, fish-based soup, is a must entree in Rome, Italy, where Delbello was born. He also owned restaurants there and around the world, often serving celebrities. His feast soup at Il Portico will be lobster bisque and the baccala in dishes is never the salt-dried type popular in southern Italy but always fresh as in Rome. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, DiPaolo's Italian Ristorante in Penns Grove also will offer meat entrees of beef, ham and pork along with seven fish dishes, including crab cakes and octopus served buffet-style. </p>
<p> Nunzio's in Collingswood and La Girasole in Atlantic City also are among those restaurants offering the Christmas Eve feast. Reservations are recommended at all the restaurant feasts. </p>
<p> Pannetone, a sweet bread with raisins and other dried fruits, is one of the traditional desserts of La Vigilia. It is house-made at Nunzio's, where feast dinners begin as early as 1:30 p.m. </p>

<p> 'Keep the Italian custom going' </p>
<p> John Alexander of Edgewater Park is half Italian and a regular customer at Il Portico, but on Christmas Eve he hosts his own seven fishes dinner at home. </p>
<p> "My Ulissi family from Abruzzo ate baccala and smelts when i was little. I picked it up again myself over 30 years ago after reading about it in food magazines. It is expensive with tricky recipes and hard to do, especially since fish can’t easily be cooked ahead," he said, "but I like to have friends and all the family over from older members to the children and keep the Italian dinner custom going.". </p>
<p> "My dinner revolves around shrimp (cold cocktail usually but hot, too, on cannellini bean bruschetta), scallops, clams and pasta, and baked flounder or monkfish." </p>
<p> For smaller, traditional dishes, he features fried oysters, fried calamari, lobster/scallop fritters and smelts but also adds eel sushi he learned to prepare from the Japanese restaurant Sagami in Collingswood. </p>
<p> "I make baccala from dried cod and red sauce with bread every year because it's the old tradition — and every year only one or two people eat it," he continued, alluding to the very salty taste that appeals to few of his guests. </p>
<p> "The next morning I have Champagne and caviar for breakfast, bagels and lox and latkes with apple sauce — the perfect birthday brunch to celebrate the birth of little Jewish boy Jesus!." </p>

<p> On the Stay-at-home chef, I'm showing you how to make easy baked pork chops. My family absolutely loves pork chops in the past. I've shown you how to make the perfect thick cut pork chop as well as showing you how to make a smoked pork chops. Today, I'm showing you how to make this easy baked boneless pork chop that is perfect for a week night dinner. We're gonna start with four pork chops and I like mine to be on the thicker side so you want them about one inch thick and then we're gonna take some extra virgin olive oil. Rub it onto both sides of each pork chop. Then we're gonna put together a simple rub that will provide the seasoning for our meat. It starts with two teaspoons of salt pork needs a lot of salt and you'll also need a teaspoon of black pepper, a teaspoon of onion powder and a teaspoon of smoked paprika. I'm gonna give this a quick stir pork has so much flavor on its own that you wanna make sure you keep your seasonings really simple so you can let the flavor of the meat shine through. We're gonna take this and sprinkle it on to our chops and then you'll also wanna make sure that you rub it in. You'll get a nice Red coloring to it and then flip it over rub some in on the other side as well. Next, you'll need a nine by 13 baking pan and you wanna spray that with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray, you'll lay your pork chops directly into this. Pan. That's really it if you wanted to you could add in some veggies like Green beans just toss them in a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper and surround the pork chops with them but I'm just gonna leave mine plane today. Next, we're gonna bake this in a 400 degree oven for 1520 minutes or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of a hundred and 40 - five degrees Fahrenheit. If you wanna add a little bit of Browning and caramelization to the top, you can place it under Setting for just a couple of minutes to give it a little bit of a reverse sear or you can throw it into a hot cast iron skillet with a little bit more olive oil and get that sear on it as well and then you're ready to eat. </p>

<p> Warning </p>
<p> Rituals and reasons many and varied </p>
<p> Friday January 13, 2012 Written by Published in Features </p>
<p> The reasons for haircutting ceremonies and its history in the Cook Islands vary from island to island and family to family. </p>
<p> One thing that is for sure is that the ceremony brings extended families and communities together in honour of ancestors past and futures yet to be written. </p>
<p> Puna Rakanui, emcee at the recent haircutting ceremony of five-year-old Atiu warrior Ezekiel Tuatea Tatuava-Enjoy, says that he has been part of numerous haircutting ceremonies and each was organised for different reasons. </p>
<p> For my family the first and second born sons had a haircutting ceremony and so did a brother that was adopted, says Rakanui. </p>
<p> Everyone has their own reasons for having a haircutting ceremony but for our family it was a way of marking an occasion. </p>
<p> Rakanui says that he believes on Mangaia, adopted sons were made to grow their hair. </p>
<p> This we call paruangai where parents adopt a child from the day they were born and from that day they grow that child and his hair and a day is chosen for that childs haircutting ceremony to mark the occasion of his adoption. </p>
<p> Rakanui also believes that the tradition of haircutting began shortly after the arrival of missionaries to the islands. </p>
<p> I believe that haircutting ceremonies began because when the missionaries arrived it was part of their dress men wore their hair short and so the locals had to cut their hair short, says Rakanui. </p>
<p> Plus when they began schools they made the boys keep their hair short because hair is where the dirt sits! </p>
<p> The traditions and purpose of haircutting in the Cook Islands have been researched and finding documented in such compilations as Haircutting Ceremony of the Cook Islands by G.Jowitt and Jennifer Wendt. </p>
<p> In 1983, T.M Loomis of the University of Adelaide researched the Cook Islands haircutting rituals as practised in New Zealand and published his findings in The Journal of the Polynesian Society. </p>
<p> He discovered the origins and practises surrounding haircutting were not clear cut. </p>
<p> He wrote, Whether or not the haircutting ritual is traditional is a subject of debate among Cook Islanders, particularly orators and elders. </p>
<p> While researching haircutting, Cook Islands Library and Museum curator Jean Mason has discovered many fascinating stories and accounts of the importance of hair. </p>
<p> She has discovered that in the past or before the arrival of missionaries to the islands men grew their hair long in boyhood. </p>
<p> To understand the reason for this is understand the world of the pre-Christian Maori who believed evil spirits roamed the world during the night. There was a belief that growing a boys hair long ensured he survived beyond infancy. To protect their male children parents allowed them to grow their hair long to deceive these evil spirits (who went about at night feeling the heads of the children and taking the souls of the boys, who would otherwise have had short hair). Both sexes were hard to tell apart at night. </p>
<p> Only men who became warriors were permitted to wear their hair in a top-knot. The practicalities of this for a warrior, goes without saying it was crucial to keep hair off the face, thus not hampering vision or movement in times of battle, which could mean the difference between life and death. </p>

<p> Ready Steady Cook episodes and chef's Instagram usernames </p>
<p> More on </p>
<p> Ready Steady Cook is back for 2020 on BBC One this week - here's all you need to know. </p>
<p> In a revamped format featuring Rylan Clark-Neal, Ready Steady Cook's brand new series airs weekdays at 4:30PM on BBC One. </p>
<p> There are twenty episodes in the new series, running Monday-Fridays for four weeks. </p>
<p> Ready Steady Cook's new format </p>
<p> In each episode, two contestants are paired up with a chef, going head to head in the newly designed Ready Steady Cook kitchen. But in this new series, the chefs face two different taste tests and the clock is always ticking! </p>
<p> In the first challenge, each contestant is armed with their bag of ingredients, all bought within a range of prices from £3.50 to £10. They have just 20 minutes to create delicious, surprising and inspiring dishes ready to wow the discerning studio audience. </p>
<p> There are further twists along the way including wildcard ingredients. The revamped second challenge is even faster, as each pair has just ten minutes to create yet more amazing dishes, this time based on audience ingredients cards. </p>
<p> Finally, in Ready Steady tradition, the winner is decided by the audience who have their say on the best dishes by voting with the iconic red tomato and green pepper voting cards. </p>
<p> Ready Steady Cook 2020 chefs </p>
<p> Five professional chefs are taking part in the new series. </p>
<p> Mike Reid, Anna Haugh, Rylan Clark-Neal, Romy Gill, Ellis Barrie, Akis Petretzikis </p>
<p> Mike Reid </p>
<p> Follow Mike on Instagram @mikereidchef With a career spanning 20 years on both sides of the globe, Mike Reid brings a wealth of experience to the RSC kitchen. He first fell in love with cooking while at university, and after choosing to follow his passion full time, found himself under the tutelage of Michel Roux Jr, Gordon Ramsay, and even cooking alongside Heston Blumenthal. </p>
<p> Romy Gill </p>
<p> Romy initially learned to cook from her mother while growing up in India. She moved to the UK for university and decided to make the UK her home. A trip to her local curry house left her longing for the authentic flavours of real Indian food and so she decided to open a restaurant, Romy’s Kitchen in Bristol. </p>
<p> Akis Petretzikis </p>
<p> Akis discovered his true love was cooking whilst training to be an accountant. Within a year of finishing his degree he had gone on to become the first Greek winner of MasterChef, and later became Head Chef at Michel Roux’s Avenue Bistro. Since then he has become a regular name on Greek TV, fronting several of his own cooking shows, and even hosting the Greek version of Ready Steady Cook. With his own line of cookbooks, food products and his own (bilingual) YouTube channel, this is not a chef who shies away from a challenge. </p>
<p> Ellis Barrie </p>
<p> Ellis got his big break in cooking aged just 15, at Fellini’s in Liverpool. After developing his skills in restaurants across Liverpool and Australia, he eventually relocated to his family home in Anglesey, where with his brothers he turned an abandoned chicken shed on an old camp-site into one of the region’s most talked-about restaurants, the Marram Grass. </p>
<p> Anna Haugh </p>
<p> Anna grew up surrounded by a family who loved cooking and while her career has brought her through some of the top restaurants all over the UK and France, she has never lost touch with those Irish roots. After establishing herself at restaurants including London’s Pied à Terre and Paris’ Hotel Lotti, she helped launch Gordon Ramsay’s London House restaurant, acting as its first head chef. It was always her dream, however, to launch her own restaurant, and in 2019 that became a reality with Myrtle in Chelsea. </p>
<p> Ready Steady Cook airs weekdays at 4:30PM on BBC One. </p>
<p> Episodes are available to watch and catch up online via the BBC iPlayer. </p>

<p> Succulent, pan-fried pork chops are high on the list of America's favorite comfort foods. Pan-fried pork chops are a fast meal, which has added to their popularity; they only take about 10 minutes to cook. Unfortunately, like many comfort foods, pork chops that are cooked in this manner are not good for you. One pan-fried pork chop has 391 calories and more than 16 g of fat. As a result, these pork chops should be enjoyed infrequently or for special occasions only. </p>
<p> Heat the oil over high heat in your skillet. </p>
<p> Add the pork chops and cook for five minutes on each side. </p>
<p> Remove the pork chops from the oil, and insert the meat thermometer in the center of a pork chop, away from any bones. The temperature should be 160 degrees F. If the pork chop is under 160 degrees F, return it to the oil and cook it for one more minute. Take the temperature again and repeat the process until the pork chop has completely cooked. </p>
<p> Do not consume undercooked pork chops. Raw pork contains a bacteria called trichinosis that can cause illness or death. </p>

<p> Italian Culture: Facts, Customs & Traditions </p>
<p> Italy is home to more than 62 million individuals as of 2017 and is ranked 23rd in population size when compared with other countries throughout the world. Italian culture is steeped in the arts, family, architecture, music and food. Home of the Roman Empire and a major center of the Renaissance, culture on the Italian peninsula has flourished for centuries. Here is a brief overview of Italian customs and traditions. </p>
<p> Population of Italy </p>
<p> About 96 percent of the population of Italy is Italian, though there are many other ethnicities that live in this country. North African Arab, Italo-Albanian, Albanian, German, Austrian and some other European groups fill out the remainder of the population. Bordering countries of France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia to the north have influenced Italian culture, as have the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily and Sardinia. </p>
<p> Languages of Italy </p>
<p> The official language of the country is Italian. About 93 percent of the Italian population speaks Italian as native language, according to the BBC. There are a number of dialects of the language spoken in the country, including Sardinian, Friulian, Neapolitan, Sicilian, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian and Calabrian. Milanese is also spoken in Milan. Other languages spoken by native Italians include Albanian, Bavarian, Catalan, Cimbrian, Corsican, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Slovenian and Walser. </p>
<p> Family life in Italy </p>
<p> "Family is an extremely important value within the Italian culture," Talia Wagner, a Los Angeles-based marriage and family therapist, told Live Science. Their family solidarity is focused on extended family rather than the West's idea of "the nuclear family" of just a mom, dad and kids, Wagner explained. </p>
<p> Italians have frequent family gatherings and enjoy spending time with those in their family. "Children are reared to remain close to the family upon adulthood and incorporate their future family into the larger network," said Wagner. </p>
<p> Religion in Italy </p>
<p> The major religion in Italy is Roman Catholicism. This is not surprising, as Vatican City, located in the heart of Rome, is the hub of Roman Catholicism and where the Pope resides. Roman Catholics and other Christians make up 80 percent of the population, though only one-third of those are practicing Catholics. The country also has a growing Muslim immigrant community, according to the University of Michigan. Muslim, agnostic and atheist make up the other 20 percent of the population, according to the Central Intelligence Agency. </p>
<p> Art and architecture in Italy </p>
<p> Italy has given rise to a number of architectural styles, including classical Roman, Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical. Italy is home to some of the most famous structures in the world, including the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The concept of a basilica — which was originally used to describe an open public court building and evolved to mean a Catholic pilgrimage site — was born in Italy. The word, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is derived from Latin and meant "royal palace." The word is also from the Greek basilikē, which is the feminine of basilikos which means "royal" or basileus, which means "king." </p>
<p> Italy also is home to many castles, such as the Valle d'Aosta Fort Bard, the Verrès Castle and the Ussel Castle. </p>
<p> Florence, Venice and Rome are home to many museums, but art can be viewed in churches and public buildings. Most notable is the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican, painted by Michelangelo sometime between 1508 and 1512. </p>
<p> Opera has its roots in Italy and many famous operas — including "Aida" and "La Traviata," both by Giuseppe Verdi, and "Pagliacci" by Ruggero Leoncavallo — were written in Italian and are still performed in the native language. More recently, Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti made opera more accessible to the masses as a soloist and as part of the Three Tenors. </p>
<p> Italy is home to a number of world-renowned fashion houses, including Armani, Gucci, Benetton, Versace and Prada. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine </p>
<p> Italian cuisine has influenced food culture around the world and is viewed as a form of art by many. Wine, cheese and pasta are important part of Italian meals. Pasta comes in a wide range of shapes, widths and lengths, including penne, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli and lasagna. </p>
<p> For Italians, food isn't just nourishment, it is life. "Family gatherings are frequent and often centered around food and the extended networks of families," said Wagner. </p>
<p> No one area of Italy eats the same things as the next. Each region has its own spin on "Italian food," according to CNN. For example, most of the foods that Americans view as Italian, such as spaghetti and pizza, come from central Italy. In the North of Italy, fish, potatoes, rice, sausages, pork and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with tomatoes are popular, as are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto. In the South, tomatoes dominate dishes, and they are either served fresh or cooked into sauce. Southern cuisine also includes capers, peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, eggplant and ricotta cheese. </p>
<p> Wine is also a big part of Italian culture, and the country is home to some of the world's most famous vineyards. The oldest traces of Italian wine were recently discovered in a cave near Sicily's southwest coast. "The archaeological implications of this new data are enormous, especially considering that the identification of wine [is] the first and earliest-attested presence of such product in an archaeological context in Sicily," researchers wrote in the study, published online August 2017 in the Microchemical Journal. </p>
<p> Doing business in Italy </p>
<p> Italy's official currency is the euro. Italians are known for their family-centric culture, and there are a number of small and mid-sized businesses. Even many of the larger companies such as Fiat and Benetton are still primarily controlled by single families. "Many families that immigrated from Italy are traditionalists by nature, with the parents holding traditional gender roles. This has become challenging for the younger generations, as gender roles have morphed in the American culture and today stand at odds with the father being the primary breadwinner and the undisputed head of the household and the mother being the primary caretaker of the home and children," said Wagner. </p>
<p> Meetings are typically less formal than in countries such as Germany and Russia, and the familial structure can give way to a bit of chaos and animated exchanges. Italian business people tend to view information from outsiders with a bit of wariness, and prefer verbal exchanges with people that they know well. </p>
<p> Italian holidays </p>
<p> Italians celebrate most Christian holidays. The celebration of the Epiphany, celebrated on January 6, is much like Christmas. Belfana, an old lady who flies on her broomstick, delivers presents and goodies to good children, according to legend. </p>
<p> Pasquetta, on the Monday after Easter, typically involves family picnics to mark the beginning of springtime. </p>
<p> November 1 commemorates Saints Day, a religious holiday during which Italians typically decorate the graves of deceased relatives with flowers. </p>
<p> Many Italian towns and villages celebrate the feast day of their patron saint. September 19, for example, is the feast of San Gennaro, the patron saint of Napoli. </p>
<p> April 25 is the Liberation Day, marking the 1945 liberation ending World War II in Italy in 1945. </p>

<p> A New Way of Cooking </p>
<p> My husband and I are crazy over these pans. You have to take care of them—no slamming them down, etc. You bring the heat up more slowly, which makes cooking slightly more attention-necessary. It has changed how we cook for the better and the food is better too. We are really happy we bought these. </p>
<p> Love it. </p>
<p> I have been searching for yrs for pots and pans I can cook in with out the leaching of toxins into my food. These do take a bit of time to adjust to since you have to warm up slowly but Im getting the hang of it. With adding a very light coating of oil after short warm up I have had no sticking or clean up issues. I have since purchased the 8” versa pot and want to add the bigger one at a future date. </p>

<p> End Cut & Chef Jordan Schor </p>
<p> Cooking is a holistic process of planning, preparing, dining, & sharing food. I place food at the center of humanity, as it nourishes, not only our physical bodies, but also our emotional & spiritual lives. Food is truly a cultural phenomenon that forms our traditions & our relationships with the earth. I genuinely believe the food connects us all - Eric Ripert, Le Bernadin </p>
<p> From the apron strings of his mother, to the kitchens of Boston & Manhattan - Chef Jordan has learned and honed techniques/craft. He cooks from the heart, and serves an all from menu of French, Italian fusion. Dinner at End Cut is a lingering affair. There are only 30 seats, and each table is guided through each course with care of a world known bistro. (End Cut is with not pretentious, not complicated, just simple food with maximum flavor). For me food is about memories, feelings and emotions - that is why End Cut is not just a restaurant, but an experience. </p>
<p> Chef Jordan fell in love cooking at a very young age. Standing at his mother's side, as she cooked family meals, Jordan saw the love infused every meal his mother prepares. Seasonal homegrown produce, homemade sauces and freshly baked breads were on the table every day. "My mother loved to cook and you could feel the love in every bite." I try to continue this in my craft with every dish I serve. </p>
<p> The farm to table movement is nothing new to Chef Jordan. The focus of his mother's kitchen was "the pick of the day" - which he does every day. We would go to the butcher, fish market or farm every day. End Cut continues this tradition on a daily basis. </p>
<p> After spending two decades in the Hudson Valley, Chef Jordan has come to understand the offerings of his community - abundant with fresh, local ingredients. When you acknowledge, as you must, that there is no such thing as perfect food, only the idea of it. The real purpose of striving towards perfection becomes clear - to make people happy. This is what creative cooking is about. </p>
<p> In the end, a great meal is not about the food or the wine. A great meal is an emotional experience. We try to make it an extraordinary one by creating a beautiful environment, with staff who cares about it as they do their home, and care for you as the most important guest in it. Chef Jordan is obsessive about the culinary details and fundamental techniques - that are the foundation of an exciting culinary imagination & a kitchen that delivers the very best products of the earth to table. </p>
<p> No details or element can be less important or more important than another. A great meal is not one that fills you up. A great meal is not one that fills you up. A great meal is a kind of journey that returns you to sources of pleasure you may have forgotten and takes you to places you haven't been. </p>
<p> Charities We Proudly Support </p>
<p> In the midst of uncertain times, we have made the incredibly difficult decision to close End Cut; including take-out and delivery until we can safely resume all operations as suggested by the state and CDC. </p>
<p> We greatly appreciate your support and wish you all good health! Let’s hope this passes soon and we can resume what we love most and that’s serving you the best fine dining experience! Be well! </p>

<p> The culture, customs, and traditions vary from region to region. For example, the traditions of Italians from Sicily, Veneto, and Campania vary greatly from each other. Let us, in this Historyplex article, celebrate the Italian culture, right from its art and architecture to being today’s fashion capital. </p>
<p> Architecture </p>
<p> The Colosseum </p>
<p> The Leaning Tower of Pisa </p>
<p> Italy has given birth to a number of architectural styles, including classical Roman, Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical styles. The architectural style of Italy began with ancient styles of the Etruscans and Greeks, which further progressed into classical Roman during the Renaissance, and then evolved into the Baroque era. </p>
<p> The architecture of ancient Rome adopted the elements of Greek architecture around the 2nd century BCE, thereby giving birth to an altogether different architectural style. The use of vaults and arches in their architecture, combined with their sound knowledge of building materials, enabled the Romans to create some of the greatest masterpieces of the Italian architecture. The Colosseum, along with the aqueducts of Rome, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Baths of Caracalla are excellent examples of this. </p>
<p> The Milan Cathedral </p>
<p> St. Peter’s Basilica </p>
<p> The concept of basilica was invented in Italy during the Early Christian age, with the Old St. Peter’s Church being the first notable Christian basilica. Byzantine architecture widely spread in Italy with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE. The Byzantines kept the Roman architecture style intact with a slight Eastern twist. Their monuments had a slightly flatter dome, and used more gilded mosaics and icons instead of statues. </p>
<p> The Saint Mark’s Basilica in Venice is a spectacular example of the Byzantine architecture in Italy. The Romanesque movement that occurred from 800 CE to the 1100 CE, produced Italy’s best masterpieces. The Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Basilica of Sant’Ambrogio were built during this period. </p>
<p> The Renaissance in the 15th century is considered the golden period of Italian architecture. Architects like Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Donato Bramante, and Andrea Palladio made great contributions to the Italian architecture. St. Peter’s Basilica is considered to be the greatest achievement of this period. </p>
<p> Other significant monuments built during this period include the Florence Cathedral, Basilica of San Lorenzo, Basilica of Sant’Andrea, Medici Riccardi Palace, and Villa Rotonda. </p>
<p> Italy proudly boasts of 95,000 monumental churches, 40,000 forts and castles, 30,000 historical residences with 4,000 gardens, 36,000 archives and libraries, 20,000 historical cities and towns, 5,600 museums and archaeological sites, and 1,500 convents. </p>
<p> Art </p>

<p> Italy is a sheer paradise for art lovers. Italian art has influenced several major artistic movements and has given birth to the most notable painters and sculptors. Italy is home to some of the most famous art galleries, museums, and exhibitions. Major art capitals in the country include Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Naples, and Turin. Art in Italy was mainly transformed during Roman times. </p>
<p> The Roman art brought three major features in Italian art: the art of portraits, landscape painting, and history presentation. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Roman art tradition continued to exist. The Italian Renaissance is said to be the golden period of art in Italy, which spanned from the 14th to the 17th century. Painters like Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Titian produced some of their most notable work during this period. </p>
<p> Michelangelo’s David </p>
<p> The Fountain of Neptune </p>
<p> Sculptors like Lorenzo Ghiberti, Luca Della Robbia, Donatello, Filippo Brunelleschi, and Andrea del Verrocchio also gave Italy some great masterpieces. The cities that are most renowned for their art include Rome, Florence, Assisi, Venice, Siena, Pisa, and Naples. Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the Capitoline Museums in Rome, the Brera Art Gallery in Milan, and the archaeological sites such as Pompei and Herculaneum, are nothing but a treat for art lovers. </p>
<p> Italy has a rich combination of masterpieces to offer from different areas, from the Ancient Greeks and Romans to the present day. Florence, Venice, and Rome are home to innumerable art galleries, museums, and exhibitions. The museums in Italy attract a lot of tourists. They showcase some of the greatest works of art and culture. The Sforza castle in Milan and the Uffizi Gallery in Florence are two of the most famous museums in Italy. </p>
<p> Music and Dance </p>

<p> Music has played a significant role in the culture of Italy. Piano and violin were invented in Italy, and so were the classical music forms such as symphony, concerto, and sonata. Music in Italy is heavily influenced by its history. The traditional music in Italy differs from region to region. Italy’s folk music styles include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial songs. </p>
<p> The folk songs include ballads, lyrical songs, and seasonal songs depending on upcoming festivals, children’s songs, as well as lullabies. Opera, one of the most renowned music forms, was also invented in Italy in the early 17th century. Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, and Puccini are some of the most famous operas of Italy, and are still performed all over the world. The La Scala opera house in Milan is one of the best opera houses in the world. </p>
<p> Jazz is another music genre that has a strong foothold in Italy―the most famous centers being Milan, Rome, and Sicily. Music in the northern half of the country has Celtic influences, while that in the southern half has Greek and Arabic influences. Sardinia is very well-known for its distinctive style of chanting done through a triple clarinet instrument, which is played using circular breathing. </p>
<p> Traditional Italian Dancers Performing Tarantella </p>

<p> Famous folk dances performed in northern Italy include monferrina, girometta, giga, ruggero, galletta, veneziana, and bergamasca. The ones performed in central Italy are saltarello romagna, saltarello ciociara, lu sardarellu, laccio d’amore, trescone, and tresconeto, whereas the ones performed in Southern Italy are tarantella napoletana, tarantella calabrese, ndrezzata, pizzica, la pecorara, and la vala. </p>
<p> Various weapon dances like Spandonari di San Giorgio, lachera, and Spandonari di San Vicenzo are also performed in Italy. The couple dances in Italy are collectively referred to as saltarello. The flag dances and the monferrina of Italy are also very popular. </p>
<p> Clothing </p>
<p> Italians are very well-known for their dressing style. The dress code in Italy is usually formal and elegant, unlike in North European and North American countries. Italians are known to dress appropriately, according to the occasion. Bathing costumes and revealing tops and shirts are considered unfit for shops, streets, or restaurants, and are usually limited to pools and beaches. Moreover, jeans is also considered inappropriate for churches or restaurants. </p>
<p> Traditional Italian Clothing </p>
<p> Women in Traditional Clothing </p>
<p> Man in Traditional Clothing </p>
<p> The long history of Italy and the country’s various traditions have produced cultural and folk diversity. Therefore, the traditional Italian clothing differs from region to region. The clothing in Northern Italy is mainly inspired from the peasant dresses in the Middle Ages. In the Veneto region, the clothing for women includes embroidered skirts and bodices over lightweight blouses. They are worn with elaborate hats, which have flowers and fruits on them. </p>
<p> They usually wear white shirts with longitudinal wrinkles, and tight bodices that are short, sleeveless, and buttoned. An apron is tied in the front, and handkerchiefs or hats are used as headgear. Footwear is generally made out of wool, and recalled hooves or scarpete. Men’s clothes are simpler as compared to the women, and have embroider and metal buttons and pins on them. Their clothing is characterized by a white shirt, vest open or buttoned, knee breeches, and sometimes a hat. </p>
<p> Most traditional clothing is made from a waterproof type of wool called orbace. South Italy is represented by costumes that are filled with vibrant colors, and have aprons and light shawls. </p>
<p> Fashion </p>
<p> Italian fashion is mainly dominated by Milan, Rome, and Florence, which are among the top 30 fashion capitals of the world. In 2009, Milan was declared as the world fashion capital surpassing New York, Paris, Rome and London. Many of the major Italian fashion brands, such as Valentino, Versace, Prada, Armani, Trussardi, Moschino, Etro, Zegna, and Dolce & Gabbana are currently located in the city. </p>

<p> Other major brands like Gucci, Roberto Cavalli, Patrizia Pepe, Enrico Coveri, and Emilio Pucci presently have their headquarters in Florence. Other major players such as Prada and Chanel have large offices and stores situated in Florence and its outskirts. </p>
<p> Cuisine </p>
<p> Italian Cuisine </p>
<p> Spaghetti </p>
<p> Italian food has its roots in Etruscan, ancient Greek, and ancient Roman cuisines. It is popular all over the world, and has its influence on various cuisines. In Italy, wine, cheese, and pasta form an integral part of the meal. Pasta, is loved and preferred, in the various shapes and lengths that it is available in. This includes penne, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli, and lasagna. </p>
<p> Pasta </p>
<p> Lasagna </p>
<p> Fish, potatoes, sausages, rice, and pork form the main ingredients in the northern part of the country, whereas southern cooking is mainly dominated by tomatoes. Capers, olives, garlic, eggplant, and ricotta cheese are other main ingredients of southern cooking. The Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients like tomatoes, pecorino cheese, fish, and all kinds of meat. The meals usually consist two courses: a side dish and coffee. </p>
<p> Typically, fresh or dried fruit or a little cheese is served as dessert. </p>
<p> Religion </p>
<p> Roman Catholicism is the largest religion in Italy. Vatican City serves as the center of Roman Catholicism all over the world, and is the home of the Pope. The Roman Catholic Church plays a role in the nation’s political affairs due to the Holy See’s location in the Vatican City. Some of the religious Italian traditions, such as creating a nativity scene outside a church, have become worldwide traditions. </p>
<p> Pope Benedict after the Christmas Mass, 2012 </p>
<p> The regular religious practices include weekly church services, observance of religious holidays, and obeying the religious doctrine, as instructed by the Pope. </p>
<p> Italian celebrations too, place a lot of emphasis on the saints and Virgin Mary. Almost 98% of Italians are Roman Catholic. Minorities of Protestant, Waldensian, Eastern Orthodox, and other Christian churches also reside in Italy. The second largest religion followed in Italy is Islam, with 1.4% Muslim population. Italy’s population also includes 75,000 Hindus, 50,000 Buddhists, and 30,000 Jews. </p>
<p> Baptism and Weddings </p>
<p> Italian Wedded Couple </p>
<p> Religion plays a very important role when a child is born into an Italian family. The baby is baptized in a traditional Roman Catholic ceremony, where the parents choose a godmother and godfather for the baby, who are obligated to raise the baby in case the birth parents fail to do so, due to some reason. </p>
<p> In a traditional Italian courtship, the groom needs the permission of the bride’s family before marrying her. Italians too, wear a diamond ring as a symbol of engagement and marriage. The wedding is usually held at a morning mass, which is followed by a day-long feast and a reception. The reception features a traditional Italian meal which includes various drinks, appetizers, three or four courses, side dishes, cheese and fruit, and a variety of desserts. </p>
<p> Interesting Wedding Traditions </p>
<p> » During the reception, in a tradition called la borsa, the bride carries a small satin bag, in which friends and family place cash, in exchange of a dance with her. </p>
<p> » The newlyweds’ first dance is tarantella, a traditional Italian dance. The guests at the wedding form a circle and dance around the couple. It is called the dance of a spider, and involves light movements with passionate hand gestures. </p>
<p> » The groom cuts his tie at the end of the wedding ceremony, which the groomsmen then sell off, usually to pay for the band. </p>
<p> » Another interesting and one of the oldest traditions is to gift candy-coated Jordan almonds wrapped in tulle to the guests, which represent the bittersweet nature of marriage. </p>
<p> » The bride usually wears a green dress on the night before her wedding, as this is supposed to bring the couple abundance and good luck. </p>
<p> Festivals </p>
<p> Italy is a land of festivals, and each festival has a deep-rooted tradition. It hosts various colorful religious rituals, historical pageants, medieval-style tournaments, film festivals, contemporary art events, bizarre traditional spectacles, and much more. Most festivals symbolize historical events, and involve processions of hundreds and thousands of people dressed up in costumes. Venice and Florence remain the topmost destinations, when it comes to attracting visitors during festivals. </p>
<p> Flower Festival in Diano Marina, Italy </p>
<p> The outstanding opening of the Venice Carnival, along with the two-week festival is something that is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Italy. The Festa della Madonna della Salute, also known as la Salute, is celebrated to pay respect to La Salute, a church, which is one of the city’s most popular landmark. The Scoppio del Carro, celebrated in Florence on the Easter Sunday morning, has been in existence for over 500 years now, and is an excellent combination of fireworks, bizarre spectacle, and a religious tradition. </p>
<p> Battle of Oranges in Italy </p>
<p> Participants in Masks during the Venice Carnival </p>
<p> The Festa della Madonna Bruna, celebrated in Matera, is another popular festival, and is an unusual combination of religion and destruction. The festival showcases the loudest and most brightest fireworks in Europe. Also notable are the various flower art festivals that are held in early summer, especially the Almond Blossom Festival at Agrigento in Sicily, where magnificent art works are created using only the flower petals and seeds. </p>
<p> Other popular festivals include Calcio Storico, Orange Battle at Carnevale di Ivrea, Palio, Game of the Bridge, Sagra di’ Pinolo, Festino di Santa Rosalia, Corsa Dei Seri, L’Ardia di San Constantino, Festival Del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, and Fiesta di San Marco. </p>
<p> Family Life </p>
<p> Italians are very family-oriented. In the olden days, the families used to be large, where the couple often had more than six children. However, things have drastically changed in the last 30 years with the country’s transition from an agricultural system into an industrial system. The Italian families are relatively smaller in size, and are made up of only one or two children. People, nowadays, marry later and less frequently, and have fewer children. </p>
<p> Usually, families in the South will have more children than the ones in the North. However, even though the families are smaller now, the members spend a lot of time together, and make sure that they gather for at least one meal every day to talk about the day’s events. Also, the members share a very strong bond, even if they live far from their families, and always join their families on every small and big festival. Children in the families tend to stay with their families longer than those in the Western countries. And even after they are married, they often choose to live closer to the parents of one of the parties. Sometimes, they even choose to live in the same building or house. Older members in the family are highly respected. They usually have the most power, and often make all the decisions in the family. </p>
<p> Languages </p>
<p> Italian is the official language of Italy, and 93% of the Italian population are native Italian speakers. However, there are a number of dialects like Sardinian, Friulian, Neapolitan, Sicilian, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian and Calabrian, spoken throughout the country. Natives also speak Bavarian, Catalan, Cimbrian, Corsican, Croatian, French, Greek, Slovenian, and Walser. </p>
<p> A minor population of the country also speaks German and Albanian. Additionally, Milanese is widely spoken in Milan. In all, there are 34 languages that are spoken in Italy. </p>
<p> Italian is a romance language, which means that, like Spanish, French, and Portuguese, it has been derived from Latin. Due to the regional diversity, one can find various dialects in which Italian is spoken. However, if you visit Italy, you will be surprised to see that in spite of the variety in the accents and dialects, you can easily understand everyone’s Italian, and they can understand yours, since an Italian will rarely speak in his dialect with a foreigner. </p>
<p> Sports </p>
<p> Football, like in many European countries, is popular in Italy too. The Italian national team is one of the best in the world, and has won the World Cup in 1934, 1938, 1982, and 2006. Other sports that are enjoyed in the country include rugby, volleyball, basketball, boxing, and cycling. </p>

<p> Etiquette </p>
<p> When introduced to someone in a formal manner, ‘molto lieto‘, meaning ‘pleased to meet you’ is commonly used. Friends greet each other using ‘buongiorno’ or a simple ‘hello’. It is conventional to say ‘good day’ or ‘good evening’, when entering a shop or a lift, or any brief meeting for that matter. Titles are used to address someone who is elderly. If the title is unknown, they are generally addressed as signore (for men) and signorina (for women). </p>
<p> Being very warm people, they generally treat each other with various terms of endearment. Italians generally kiss on the cheek when meeting a family member or a friend. The ladies usually offer their cheek first. The kiss is usually a light brushing of the cheeks, first on the right one and then on the left. </p>
<p> Lifestyle </p>
<p> Italians are very warm and loving people. They love to relax, celebrate, and spend time with their family and friends. And that always means chit-chatting, talking, and laughing around the table, either at home or at a restaurant. Italians, as mentioned earlier, love their family, and love their food. They never miss a chance to have the best of both worlds. But they also love talking just as much as they love eating. Conversation is considered an art form in Italy. </p>
<p> One can always see Italians of all ages engaged in discussions on a variety of topics, while walking down the streets. </p>
<p> An Italian Street </p>
<p> A Colorful Street in Venice </p>
<p> There is one place that always remains the central meeting point in the Italian culture – the piazza (square). From the biggest of cities to the most rural areas, you will always find people sitting, walking, and strolling near the piazza, irrespective of whether it is big or small. They also act as the main focal points for festivals, celebrations, and political events. </p>
<p> The only time that these piazzas and streets are deserted are the lunch and dinner timings, when the Italians are busy enjoying their lavish meals at home. For a real Italian, lunch is a 1- to 2-hour affair, the reason most of the stores as well as banks shut down during these hours. </p>
<p> A Typical Italian Restaurant </p>
<p> An Italian Scooter Parked in the Patio </p>
<p> Italians believe in enjoying life to the fullest. Anything that is meant to be enjoyed is savored and relished. An old couple walking hand in hand around the block, women gathering around and talking endlessly around the piazza, young boys playing soccer in the streets, and their mothers yelling at them from the window planter to come eat, and Italian scooters parked in patios, are usual scenes in Italy. </p>
<p> Such is the rich culture and heritage of the Italians. There are innumerable reasons to fall in love with this beautiful country, its customs, and the various traditions. Viva Italiano! </p>

<p> One-Pan Baked Apple Pork Chops </p>
<p> This One Pan Baked Apple Pork Chops is a quick and easy dinner perfect for Fall. One pan and comforting flavours your family will love. </p>
<p> Total Time: 30 mins </p>

<p> Made all in one pan, this recipe is guaranteed to be a Sunday dinner recipe the family will request again and again. It is also perfect for a busy weeknight! </p>
<p> The flavor combination in this easy recipe is amazing. Juicy pork chops with fresh apples, herbs and just a hint of Marsala. </p>
<p> Everyone loves a one-pot dinner, right? I know I do, especially when it can be on the table in around 30 minutes, just like this One Pot Chicken Orzo Pasta. </p>
<p> We love easy recipes and this is one is at the top of our list for Sunday Dinner Ideas! </p>
<p> Herbs for Pork Chops </p>
<p> One of the great flavors in this easy Baked Apple Pork Chops dinner is fresh herbs. The herbs of choice for pork chops are sage and thyme. </p>
<p> If you don’t have fresh herbs, you can always use the dried version. We have tested this recipe with fresh and dried herbs and it works really well either way. </p>
<p> I grew up with apple sauce on the side of every pork recipe. One of the things I love about this recipe is that the apples are left in slices. The sweetness really comes out when they bake alongside the pork. </p>
<p> The apples still get super soft but retain their shape at the same time. The sweet apples are enhanced by a little kick of Marsala (a sweet wine). If you don’t have Marsala on hand, a sweet sherry or light port will do the trick. </p>
<p> Best Apples for Baking </p>
<p> These favorite apples for baked apple recipes are perfect because they will not fall apart during the baking process. </p>
<p> How to make Apple Pork Chops </p>
<p> This recipe for Baked Apple Pork Chops is pretty simple as many one-pan meals are. We recommend bone-in pork chops as they have more flavor but if you prefer, go ahead and use boneless. </p>
<p> The seasoned pork chops are first seared to get a little color, then you’ll start adding the other ingredients. Here are the step by step instructions: </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 450F. </p>
<p> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Rub the pork chops with olive oil, followed by the salt, pepper, and sugar making sure it’s evenly dispersed. </p>
<p> Once the skillet is hot, add the pork chops. Sear them on one side for about 2 minutes. Add the sage leaves to the pan and turn the pork chops to sear the other side. </p>
<p> Add the butter to the pan a let it melt and brown a little. Gradually pour in the chicken stock and marsala. Mix well, then add the thyme leaves. Bring the sauce to a boil. </p>
<p> Then add the sliced apple. Turn off the heat and transfer the skillet to the oven. </p>
<p> Bake for around 12-15 minutes. </p>
<p> The sauce should be nice and thick (if not, just remove the pork chops from the pan and simmer the sauce on the stove top until desired thickness). </p>
<p> Apple Sauce for Pork Chops </p>
<p> This dish creates the most amazing caramelized apple sauce. They deserve every bit of that thick ooey gooey caramelized sauce. </p>
<p> Sometimes the sauce may not thicken up as you want. We have a solution for that! </p>
<p> Recipe Tip: If you want a thicker sauce, transfer the pork chops to a warm plate and cover them with foil. Heat the sauce in the skillet for a few minutes until it thickens up. </p>
<p> 1/8 cup fresh thyme leaves (or 2 tablespoons of dried thyme) </p>
<p> 2 apples (sliced) </p>
<p> 🔪 Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 450F. </p>
<p> Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Rub the pork chops with olive oil, followed by the salt, pepper and sugar making sure it’s evenly dispersed. </p>
<p> Once the skillet is hot, add the pork chops. Sear them on one side for about 2 minutes. </p>

<p> Easy Baked Bone In Pork Chops </p>
<p> Pork chops are an American favorite when it comes to dinner. It makes sense because chops are quick, simple and affordable. And aren’t we all a little low on time, energy and money? </p>
<p> These Baked Italian Pork Chops and Potatoes are a fantastic family meal. Sheet pan dinners are great because you just plop everything down onto a pan then bake. This pork chop recipe is so simple because we are using a short cut; instead of mixing a bunch of spices together we use the packaged Italian Dressing mix to flavor this meal. </p>
<p> What Temperature Should Pork Chops Be Cooked To </p>
<p> I tend to prefer my pork on the well done side. But if you want super tender chops then shoot for 145ºF internal temp. </p>
<p> Check out this handy Pork Temperature Breakdown by Pork.org. Basically for pork you want the internal temp to reach 145ºF-160ºF. </p>

<p> Baked Pork Chops </p>
<p> These baked pork chops are slathered in a homemade sauce and then baked very slowly. They are juicy, delicious and very easy to make. </p>
<p> Try and use a thick chop for this. If you are using thin ones you will need to adjust the cooking times a bit. Whatever you decide, you will have to make sure that the pork is completely cooked through before you eat it. </p>
<p> You will have quite a bit of sauce when you are done cooking these. You can make a gravy with it by adding a little flour or cornstarch to thicken it. I use it as is as it is super tasty. </p>
<p> Serve these with mashed potatoes or oven sweet potato fries if you would like. </p>
<p> Here is what you are going to need for these finger-licking-good baked pork chops: </p>
<p> Serves eight 8 pork chops about 1 inch thick 3 TBS yellow mustard 1 TBS mayonnaise 1 TBS honey 1 tsp. garlic powder 1 tsp. ground cumin 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. black pepper 1 tsp. oregano ½ tsp. lemon zest 1 tsp. lemon juice </p>
<p> Heat your oven to 325 degrees. Rinse and pat dry the pork chops and place them in a baking dish. </p>
<p> In a bowl mix the mustard, mayo, honey, garlic powder, cumin, salt, black pepper, oregano, lemon zest and lemon juice. Mix it well. </p>
<p> Generously slather the chops with your sauce on both sides. Cover the baking pan with aluminum foil and bake the chops for an hour and a half. </p>
<p> Remove the pork chops from the oven and uncover them. Increase the oven’s heat to 375 degrees F (180 C) and place the pan unto the oven, uncovered, for another 30 minutes. </p>
<p> Serve with your side of choice. These go beautifully with mashed potatoes. </p>

<p> Beef Braciole </p>
<p> Beef Braciole, stuffed beef rolls slowly simmered in tomato sauce, are Italian comfort food at it’s best. </p>
<p> Beef Braciole is classic Italian comfort food and a great dish to make on a wintery Sunday afternoon. Stuffed beef rolls, simmered slowly in tomato sauce so the flavors from the stuffing infuse the sauce and the meat becomes fork tender, all while filling your house with the sweet smell of Italian Sunday dinner! My father used to serve this at the restaurant with Ricotta Gnocchi on the side, but any pasta you like will do. Just toss the pasta or gnocchi with some of the sauce from the braciole and serve it right along side. Perfection! </p>
<p> This is not a new recipe, I have had Beef Braciole on this site from close to the beginning back in 2000. I am revisiting it here to add a picture and tweak the recipe a bit based on more experience making it. I mention this because I will never forget the first time I saw a big spike in traffic for The Italian Chef. Back then I used to rank pretty high on all of the search engines for certain recipes and Beef Braciole was one of them. One day I noticed a huge spike in traffic, and most of it was people visiting the Braciole recipe from search engines. </p>
<p> “Why are so many people all of a sudden searching for Braciole recipes”, I wondered? So, I put my internet slueth hat on and dug in for some research. After a bit of searching around I figured it out! The night before, the TV show Everybody Loves Raymond aired the episode “Debra Makes Something Good“, which was about Debra making Braciole, everybody loving it and it driving Marie crazy. Seems it sparked a lot of interest in the dish, causing people to Google queries like “What is braciole”. </p>
<p> I always got a kick out of that, and for a few years after I would occasionally see a (much smaller) bump in traffic to the recipe and would check to see if that episode played in syndication somewhere, and that usually was the case. It would be great if the writer’s of This is Us could do a Tortellini alla Panna episode… </p>
<p> Beef Braciole Recipe </p>
<p> Description </p>
<p> Beef Braciole, stuffed beef rolls slowly simmered in tomato sauce, are Italian comfort food at it’s best. </p>
<p> Scale 1x2x3x </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 1 lb boneless beef round, cut into 4 thin slices approximately 1/3 inch thick </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Place each slice of beef between 2 sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat pounder until 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle with salt & pepper. Lay a slice of prosciutto on each one. </p>
<p> Mix together the the pignoli beans, pecorino romano cheese, garlic and parsley and sprinkle evenly on top of the beef slices with prosciutto. Roll up the slices, tucking in the ends and tie with kitchen string. </p>
<p> Heat the olive oil in a large sauce pan over medium heat. Dredge the braciole in flour shaking off any excess, then place in the pan. Cook until browned on all sides, about 15 minutes. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and keep to the side. </p>
<p> If needed add some more olive oil to the pan then add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring until tender but not browned, about 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Add the red wine and cook, stirring up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. </p>
<p> Crush the tomatoes with your hands and add, with their juices, into the saucepan. Fill one of the tomato cans 1/2 way with water and pour in. Add the bay leaves and season with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Place the braciole back into the sauce, turn heat to low and cook at a simmer until beef is tender 1.5 – 2 hours. </p>
<p> Sprinkle the basil over the rolls, and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer to serving plates, spoon the sauce over the top and serve at once. </p>

<p> This looks really good, I think I would add more seasoning to the sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, and some dried Italian seasonings-but my Mom was only half Italian so I don’t know if it would be authentic or not. I will definitely try this! </p>
<p> My mother in law came from Italy, she taught me many dishes, this was one of them. There’s is many variations. It’s like meatloaf, everyone has a slightly different version, but they’re all good. This is mine; Any thin steak, pound it flat shake parmesan evenly over the meat, followed by Italian seasoning, garlic, onion powder & parsley, spread evenly over meat, sprinkle sparingly crushed red pepper flakes. roll up and tie, place in your spaghetti sauce and let it simmer. </p>
<p> This sounds really good! My question is, could I use tomatoes from my garden instead of canned tomatoes? </p>
<p> Julie, I typically use canned tomatoes for a slow cooked sauce like this, and fresh tomatoes for quicker sauces that need to be fresh and bright. However, you can try your garden tomatoes if you like. Just blanche them quickly in boiling water, to loosen the skin, then peel them and chop them up. Plum tomatoes that do not have a lot of seeds work best for sauces. </p>
<p> New to your site! Made this beef dish a week ago and making it again today with your recipe. We all loved it! Thank you. </p>
<p> Hi Chef, do you know if there’s another braciole recipe made with a type of pork other than prosciutto? My grandmother used to make this and I can’t remember the other meat she used besides beef but I know it wasn’t prosciutto. Also, I think she put hard-boiled eggs in it. Is there a braciole recipe like this that you know of? Thank you </p>
<p> Not sure what the other type of pork would have been. Lot of possibilities. Maybe some other kind of ham besides prosciutto? Some people put hard boiled egg in their braciole. Just not my thing 🙂 </p>
<p> She may have used a salami or supresatt. My mom did it that way and added hard boiled egg and at times raisins and pinolli. Really good. Brings. Sick memories. My family won’t eat it this way but they don’t know what they are missing. </p>
<p> Tweaks made to this one: Made sauce the day before (added 6 cloves of garlic) and pureed it next day too. Used sopressatta instead of proscuitto. Added roasted 10 garlic halves about 15 minutes near the end of the cook time. Next time: Let the whole thing sit overnight before serving up. Somehow the flavors for this were ramped up overnight for the leftoversw. Adding herbs to sauce (oregano, fennel). Double the amount for the filling. </p>
<p> I’m searching this recipe because of the Raymond episode! So funny. Would’ve never guessed that’s how it’s spelled. My Italian grandmother made this and it was part of the Sunday ritual. So sad that she passed before we were old enough to preserve this and many others. I’m going to study this and give it a try. </p>
<p> Jayme…I’m with you on this one…been watching “Everybody Loves Raymond” “bloopers…the one where Deborah makes Braciole has me stumped…she added “currants”…??!! Haven’t seen a recipe ANYWHERE calling for this…oh well, maybe throw a few in the sauce just for fun!! </p>
<p> Sicilians from Palermo make Braciole with raisins in it . I love it in the Braciole. Also bread crumbs in the stuffing. </p>
<p> Just love your recipes..are quite authentic as I have been cooking Italian for years with so many of the recipe specifics you have. I would really like to have a “recipe box” where I can save your recipes..have no possibility to print. And is Phil Torre Italian? Thanks,Janet </p>
<p> Janet, I don’t have that functionality but there are other sites dedicated to it. One is yummly.com. If you click the orange Yum button on any of my recipes, it will send you there and all you have to do is create an account and you can save the recipe in your own recipe box. Yes Torre is an Italian name. I am 100% Sicilian. </p>
<p> Hi Phil,I always loved Braciole in my Sunday sauce, since my kids moved to Texas they got away from most of the italian dinners. Texans really don’t cook much they eat out.Me I cook everyday even now that I live in Texas. It’s very hard to find Italian ingredients here. But I make the best of it. Thanks for having great Italian recipes , I too am Sicilian. Will be making Braciole Sunday. With homemade ravoli.. Thanks again </p>
<p> LOL I just came here because of Everybody Loves Raymond. I had an Italian nana growing up and she never made this. It sounds amazing!! Thanks for the recipe. </p>
<p> I’ve made this recipe a couple of times but haven’t made it in years. Have it going today. I’ve also made the ricotta gnocchi and it’s amazing. </p>
<p> I would like to make this well in advance for a,special occasion and freeze it so I’m not in a last minute panic and can relax and enjoy my evening. Does it freeze well? If so, tips on reheating Would be welcome. </p>
<p> I think if you freeze it BEFORE you cook it, you are good to go. I would then thaw it and cook it according to the directions. </p>
<p> Italian Chef, I made braciole on new years day. It was delicious brother. I used pork which I enjoy more than beef as do the ladies. </p>
<p> Sounds amazing and plan to make this for a supper club. My question is related to the ricotta gnocchi…can they be made ahead and reheat? Possibly the day before or at least the morning of? Or can I make the dough and refrigerate it then let it come to room temp and then slice and boil? </p>
<p> You can make the gnocchi ahead of time and put them in refrigerator for a couple of days or freeze them for longer. You can boil them right out of fridge or freezer. They don’t take long to cook so I wouldn’t recommend boiling then reheating next day. </p>

<p> Beef Braciole (Braciola) </p>
<p> Beef Braciole (Braciola) is a company-worthy, classic, hearty, homestyle southern Italian dish that’s perfect for a winter night or Sunday dinner. Thin slices of beef with a savory filling slowly braise in a wine-infused sauce for a dish you’ll fall in love with! </p>
<p> (Recipe updated and post republished from the original dated 12-24-14.) </p>
<p> What is Beef Braciole (Braciola)? </p>
<p> Beef Braciole (also known as braciola) is a classic Italian dish with many variations. </p>
<p> It can be made with thin, individual slices of beef such as round or as one large roll using flank steak. It can also be made with pork and it always has a savory filling. </p>
<p> The filling for Beef Braciole may be any number of things including cheese, breadcrumbs, fresh herbs, and preserved meats such as prosciutto or salami. Another combination might be spinach, pine nuts and raisins. </p>
<p> No matter what you fill it with, Beef Braciole is a delicious, hearty, Italian home-style dish you will fall in love with! </p>
<p> The inspiration behind this dish: </p>
<p> I adapted this Beef Braciole recipe from one in the “The Sopranos Family Cookbook.” (Affiliate link.) A client, who was a fan of the show, requested I prepare that specific recipe. A couple of tweaks later, it’s been a favorite on my personal chef menu ever since. </p>
<p> How to make Beef Braciole (Braciola): </p>
<p> For this version, you’ll need thinly sliced beef top round, which you can get your butcher to do. Slices of top round can be quite large so you’ll want to cut them in half widthwise. </p>
<p> Pound it out first to tenderize it, then cut in half widthwise to make it the perfect size to accommodate a slice of prosciutto. (Prosciutto is a dry-cured Italian ham. Prosciutto di Parma is imported from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy and can be quite expensive. Less expensive domestic brands are available in most supermarket deli departments.) </p>
<p> Place a piece of prosciutto over the pounded beef. </p>
<p> Top with a combination of Parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, garlic and fresh Italian parsley… </p>
<p> Tuck the sides in to secure the filling, roll into a cylinder and secure with a toothpick. </p>
<p> Brown in olive oil to a lovely deep brown then braise in the wine-infused sauce for a company-worthy dish! </p>
<p> If cooking Beef Braciole on the stovetop, you may not need the flour to thicken the sauce as it’s going to reduce as it simmers. I prefer cooking Beef Braciole in the oven or slow-cooker because those cooking methods don’t require much attention. </p>
<p> If you do need to thicken the sauce, make a slurry with flour and slowly add it to the sauce. Simmer until thickened. Here’s more information from The Kitchn on how to do it: How to Make and Use a Slurry </p>
<p> What to serve with this dish: </p>
<p> Thick, tube-shaped pasta such as penne, ziti or rigatoni </p>

<p> Beef Braciole (Braciola) is a company-worthy, classic, hearty, homestyle southern Italian dish that's perfect for a winter night or Sunday dinner. Thin slices of beef with a savory filling slowly braise in a wine-infused sauce for a dish you'll fall in love with! </p>
<p> Total Time 2 hours 30 minutes </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Cut top-round slices in half widthwise so that you have 12 equal pieces. Place beef between two pieces of plastic wrap. Gently pound to 1/4 to 1/8-inch thickness. </p>
<p> Mince 4 cloves of garlic; slice the remaining 8 cloves. </p>
<p> Combine minced garlic, parsley, cheese, breadcrumbs, salt and black pepper in a small bowl. Place a prosciutto slice over the beef then sprinkle filling evenly over all beef slices. </p>
<p> Roll the beef into a cylinder, tucking in the sides to hold in the filling as you roll. Secure with toothpicks. </p>
<p> Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Place the beef rolls, seam side down in the pot and brown seam side first to seal it. Cook, turning the meat occasionally until each roll is nicely browned on all sides. Transfer to a plate. </p>
<p> Add the wine and the sliced garlic. Bring to a boil, scraping up any browned bits. Add beef broth, tomatoes and Italian seasoning. Place beef rolls back in the pot and bring back to a simmer. </p>
<p> Cover and cook on low heat, turning occasionally until beef is tender and easily pierced with a fork, about 1 1/2 hours. Alternately, cook covered in a 325-degree oven for 1 1/2-2 hours or in a slow cooker for 3-4 hours on high, 5-6 hours on medium or 7-8 hours on low. </p>
<p> To thicken, place pot back on the stove if cooked in the oven. Remove some of the hot cooking liquid to a bowl. Add the flour and stir until smooth to create a slurry. Slowly add it to the hot cooking liquid, bring to a slow simmer and cook until thickened. </p>
<p> Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Remove toothpicks and serve over pasta with additional grated cheese if desired. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> MAKE AHEAD: You can make ahead two ways: </p>
<p> Fill, brown and place in pot with sauce and refrigerate. Proceed with cooking as directed. </p>
<p> Cook, cool and refrigerate. Reheat when needed in the oven, on the stovetop or in a slow cooker. </p>
<p> If cooking on the stovetop, you may not need the flour to thicken the sauce because of how the sauce will reduce. </p>

<p> This was absolutely delicious! I did the same as your recipe stated and everyone here at my house loved it. I served it with penne pasta and a green salad with my homemade Italien dressing. My friend stopped by for a glass of wine before dinner and she was drooling over the way it smelled as it was cooking in the oven. This is definitely on my list to make again and again. Thank you soooo much for sharing it. </p>
<p> Hi, Christa, Thank you so very much! So glad you and yours enjoyed and you made my day! Thanks again and hope you’ll try some of my other beef dishes. </p>
<p> I made this dish yesterday, but I must say I tweaked it some. I used bottom round steak because my local market has it pre-sliced in very thin pieces. I reduced the wine to one cup and added more beef broth to compensate the liquid. I also added more Italian type spices and added fresh sliced Crimini mushrooms to the sauce. Served it with penne pasta and fresh spinach. Everything turned out great and was told by my husband of over 54 years that I can make it again. That is his seal of approval. </p>
<p> Hi, Nancy, Thanks so much and glad you enjoyed! I love the adjustments you made–especially if you don’t want it as “winey.” Thanks again and hope you’ll try some of my other beef recipes. </p>
<p> Look yummy! One of my favorites is Beef Braciole! Nice to see your recipe, easy to follow, will cook this for family this weekend. Thank you! </p>
<p> Hi, I checked out this recipe because it was one of my Nonna’s specialties. The confusion with the name is just about the plural vs the singular of the name. Braciola = 1, braciole = more than one. </p>
<p> Omg this is amazing!!!!! Just made it for my husband who will be home soon and I had to have a test piece! Soooooooo good!!!! </p>
<p> Hello. I make this every year for our Italian family but have never made it in the oven. I also usually add Italian sausage for family members who like it. How long would I put this in the oven for? I’m making 20 portions and think they may not all fit in the slow cooker. Thank you and Happy Holidays! </p>
<p> Hi, Julia, Thanks so much for your question! Love the idea of adding some Italian sausage! 20 portions are most likely going to be too much for a slow cooker. The recipe says 325 for 1 1/2 to 2 hours but with so many portions, I would let it cook at least 2 hours. If you wanted to speed things up a little bit, you could do it at 350 degrees at check it at 1 1/2 hours. Thanks again and so happy this recipe has become a tradition for you! Happy Holidays! </p>
<p> Thanks so much for your question. Any grocery store deli should have prosciutto. It may only be domestic prosciutto which is fine for this recipe. If you want Prosciutto di Parma, delis may have it otherwise you can certainly get it at any Italian market. Thanks again and hope you enjoy! </p>
<p> Thanks so much, Kate! Glad everyone enjoyed and your mom had a great birthday! Thanks again! </p>
<p> I’m making this tomorrow for the first time for my mother’s 80th birthday dinner party. My grandmother used to make this! Can I prep and brown the rolls today and then finish them in the oven tomorrow? Thanks! </p>
<p> Hi, Kate, Thanks so much for your question. You absolutely can brown the rolls a day ahead of time. Hope everyone enjoys! </p>
<p> I saw this recipe referenced on Everyone Loves Raymond, and initially looked up the menus of the 4 Italian restaurants in my home town Christchurch, New Zealand, but no one had it as a meal. Tonight I made it as best as I could minus the wine and Italian seasoning. I used schnitzel as I figured that was a nice thin cut. First time ever using prosciutto. </p>
<p> I reckon I did ok – it is really yummy. My only thought was the the garlic in the middle of the rolls tasted raw. I sure didn’t need 12 cloves (such a wuss). </p>
<p> It’s a recipe I was considering for my next family pot luck, but truthfully it would be too expensive with the cost of the red meat, prosciutto and Parmesan cheese (even though I used budget brands). </p>
<p> The recipe was really easy to follow – thanks for sharing it. </p>
<p> Hi, Judith, Thanks so much for your feedback! I know everyone’s garlic tolerance differs but because of the length of time the dish cooks, the garlic should really mellow out. Thanks again and glad you enjoyed! </p>
<p> Hi Carol, your Braciole recipe looks scrumptious! We love delicious, authentic, southern Italian meals. Can this be made in an instant pot? If so can you include the directions? We recently had the most tender Braciole ever at our local restaurant and it was completely fork tender. Could it have been made with small cut pieces of flank steak? It held its shape in the cooking process but when you ate it, oh my! So so tender and easily came apart. In very broken English, the chef/owner said it was from the loin. So looking forward to trying your recipe! </p>
<p> Hi, Marianne, Thanks so much for your question. I have never made this in an electric pressure cooker although I’m sure you could. I could be wrong, but I’ve always been concerned the pressure could cause the little rolls to come apart. If you do try this in your Instant Pot, please let me know how it worked. Thanks so much! </p>
<p> This turned out beautifully. I found 8 thin slices of top round for a very reasonable price and thought they would be perfect for this dish. I didn’t have prosciutto, so I used finely diced pepperoni instead. I also added toasted pine nuts and finely chopped raisins. The top round was a bit too thin, and the stuffing was coming out, so I had to use a lot of toothpicks to hold everything in place. My braciole looked like it went a few rounds with a porcupine, but in the end, it cooked up quite nicely and the flavor was perfect. I took all the toothpicks out before serving and no one was the wiser. I cooked this entirely on the stove top and the results were perfect. I did find the sauce to be a little too tart and added some milk and sugar to mellow it out. A trick I learned from my Italian grandmother. Very good recipe with good instructions. Thanks for sharing. </p>
<p> Hi, Carey, Thanks so very much and so glad you all enjoyed! Love your tip for balancing out the sauce. I find canned tomatoes can really vary in flavor from brand-to-brand and season-to-season so yes, sometimes a little flavor finagling is in order. Thanks again! </p>
<p> My favorite grocer sells the best meat, and they sell thin cut meat for braciole. I’m going to attempt this tomorrow, and incorporate your recipe and others I’ve found. A little provolone, chopped garlic and onions, some parsley and maybe baby spinach, pine nuts, a few buttered bread crumbs….maybe some roasted red peppers, not sure what else (I tend to include too much). </p>
<p> You’re recipe sounds delicious! Maybe I’ll reign back my inclination to add everything I can think of. I need to find a good sauce for simmering. Thank you! </p>
<p> Thanks so much, Joyce and hope you enjoy! I recently made a braciole recipe for a client that had a bunch of things in it including hard-cooked eggs per their request. However, after cooking and the meat shrinking, half of the filling ended up in the sauce even though I thought I tied it up pretty tightly. I had to strain the sauce and toss most of it out. So, you may want to be careful adding too many other things. Thanks again and hope you enjoy! </p>
<p> My family is from Poland; may have even been on the same ships coming over that your family was as they came from all over Europe. I relied on an Italian friend to tell me how it was pronounced. Who cares? It’s a good dish. </p>
<p> Hi Carol, did you make your own wine-infused sauce? If so, can you add that to the article? Thank you! </p>
<p> Hi, Kristen, I’m not sure what you’re asking. The recipe includes the sauce so yes. Thanks! </p>
<p> Hi Carol – thanks for the detailed instructions. I’m going to attempt to recreate a dish I had at Coda del Pesce (codadelpesce.com). They make a Flounder Braciole that is seriously incredible. Naturally the slow cooking approach won’t adapt to fish. So I’m thinking I’ll make the sauce the same way as you’ve done above, simmering for hours. Then I’ll roll the flounder with the bread crumbs mixture in addition to some pine nuts and golden raisins. Once the sauce is finished I’ll add the flounder rolls and sauce to a casserole dish and bake. A few questions for you: 1) do you think this will work? 2) do you have any suggestions? 3) how long do you think I should bake it for? 4) do you think I should let the sauce completely cool before combining with the fish in a casserole dish? </p>
<p> Hi, Luke, Thanks for your question. I’d avoid the red wine and of course the beef broth and do a simple tomato sauce with San Marzano tomato, some white wine and a little garlic. How long you cook it will depend on the size of the flounder fillet but you want the center of the filling to be at least 145 degrees. Fish is going to toughen if overcooked but because the filling came into contact with a raw protein, it has to be cooked to a safe temperature. Thanks again and the dish at that restaurant sounds delicious! </p>
<p> I love the way meals come out in my crock pot. Can I cook the meat rolls in there with the sauce? I’m making this for a fun gathering of friends and am very excited! It looks and sounds wonderful. </p>
<p> Hi, Jerri, Thanks so much for your question. You absolutely can! I’m a huge slow-cooker fan for things like this and think they’d come out great, too. Thanks again and hope you and your friends enjoy! </p>
<p> Here I am again! For the crock pot I was going to sear the meat rolls on the stove, make a wonderful sauce also on the stove then put rolls in crock pot and pour sauce over. Sound like a good idea? </p>
<p> Hi, Jerri, Sounds like a plan! I would probably wait until the beef is cooked before adding any thickener, however. See how thick the sauce ends up. You can pull some of the liquid out, let it cool a bit, then throw in a little flour, mix well and add it back in. Let it simmer a little bit longer. Hope it all goes well! </p>
<p> Hi, Patricia, You absolutely can! Just cool it down thoroughly and place in a good, airtight container. Should be fine for about three months. Thanks for your question! </p>
<p> Hi Carol! I’m dying to try this recipe– I live where there aren’t many Italian restaurants and have never seen this on a menu. I am VERY confused about the top round, though. I’m supposed to ask a butcher to slice a cut of beef that is only 3/4″ to 1″ thick to start with, into six horizontal pieces? Is that even physically possible or have I mis-read the instructions? And then I divide it to make 12 pieces and then further pound it to fit the size of the prosciutto? I just want to make sure I have my facts straight before I go to the butcher and make a fool of myself 🙂 Thanks! </p>
<p> Hi, Carolyn, Thanks so much for your question and so sorry you’re confused. I get my top round at Kroger where it’s already sliced. You may have a Kroger or Kroger banner store near you. Here’s a photo of a whole top round roast: https://www.certifiedangusbeef.com/recipes/recipedetail.aspx?id=707 </p>
<p> Kroger slices it horizontally into thin 1/4-inch thick slices that are perhaps 6 inches wide and 10 inches long. You would then need to cut those in half widthwise to get a piece that’s approximately 3 x 5 which is closer to the size of a piece of prosciutto. </p>
<p> The Fresh Market near me does not have the meat for this recipe because they don’t have a slicer and as far as I know, Whole Foods doesn’t either. </p>
<p> Hi, Ren’ee, Thanks so much for your great question! I would do three to four hours on high or six to eight hours on low. The pieces are small they might not take the full four hours or the full eight hours. Thanks again and hope you enjoy! </p>
<p> Question for you– I am hosting a bookclub dinner very first week in Dec. 2018, for 10 women. – I’ve been obsessing over what to serve– ugh! I want a nice sit down dinner kind of kicking off Christmas season and your recipe here for Beef Braciole is calling out to me- think this would be a good choice? what should I serve with it- you listed several pasta choices- if I plate it up for each guest– how do you plate each individual persons plate?- pasta- sauce on it and braciole on top or next to it? how many braciole? just want this to look great and have no doubt it will taste great- I plan to make this weekend to sample and get any tweaks out- do you personally prepare oven or stove top- should I double for 10 women? Advice suggestions etc– It probably sounds like I don’t cook- I do but find I am very detailed oriented lately- old age– ha! Any suggestions etc would be great– maybe I do best when someone tells me exactly what to cook and prepare- the full menu and meal– appreciate your help! </p>
<p> Hi, Alice, Thanks so much for getting in touch with me! Well, I think it depends on the women and what they all like. The small rolls may be better suited to a “family-style” meal where everything gets passed. Perhaps you may want to try the other way this dish is made and that’s as one large roll which is then sliced. That way may make a better presentation for individual plating. If you do the individual rolls, I would plan on 2 per person so you would definitely have to double it. </p>
<p> I also recently posted a recipe for Pumpkin Soup with Marsala and Mascarpone that might make a good first course. A simple vegetable, some bread and I think you’re good to go! Thanks again and please let me know how it goes. </p>
<p> Looks good and i want to try but what does this mean: “Combine minced garlic, parsley, cheese, breadcrumbs, salt and black pepper in a small bowl. Place a prosciutto slice over the filling then sprinkle filling evenly over all beef slices.” When do I place a prosciutto slice over the filling? When it’s in the small bowl? Im guessing I 1) place a prosciutto slice over the filling when it’s in the bowl, 2) then invert the small bowl so I have access to the filling (prosciutto on bottom and filling on top), 3) then sprinkle the filling evenly over meat? What do I then do with the prosciutto slice? </p>
<p> Hi, Ned, Good catch! You place the prosciutto slice on the beef, then place filling over the prosciutto and roll. I try very hard, but alas, I’m still only human! Thanks again and I’ve corrected the recipe. </p>
<p> This recipe turned out great! I love it!! Thanks so much. I am definitely making this again and again : ) </p>
<p> Thank you, Beth! I’m in love with this recipe, too! It’s one of my “go-to” recipes for my beef-loving clients. Thanks again, glad you enjoyed and please stay in touch! </p>
<p> My mother-in-law made this and was the best I’ve ever tasted. I will try this and see if it is as good. I’ve never made it because I couldn’t find the recipe. So keep posting, I know you probably have so many good dishes. </p>
<p> If I want to make this with a whole flank steak what would I have to change in the recipe? </p>
<p> Hi, Ruth, Thanks for your question. Really, not that much. I would probably add another type of cheese such as provolone because you’re working with a larger piece of meat and you’ll want that filling to stand out a little more. Hope you enjoy and please let me know how it goes. </p>
<p> Hi, Ruth, Flank steaks run 1 to 1 1/2 pounds. I’ve always found the larger the flank steak, the easier they are to work with. You’ll want to roll it so that the grain runs lengthwise. Then, when you slice it, you’ll be slicing it against the grain. Here’s some more information on using a flank steak from Fine Cooking: http://www.finecooking.com/recipe/braised-beef-braciola-stuffed-with-basil-and-mozzarella </p>
<p> Yum! This dish sounds like a dream, Carol! I really love that it is adapted from the Soprano’s family cookbook. 😀 </p>
<p> Mama Mia is right! This looks mouthwatering and I cannot wait to try it! I pinned it for later! </p>
<p> These pictures have me drooling on my keyboard! I can’t wait to try this out myself. </p>
<p> I so desperately want to eat this right now! This is one of my favorites, but I always think of it as a special date night type of meal as compared to something I can make for myself. I can’t wait to try this recipe out! </p>
<p> This is absolutely stunning! Braciole is a favorite of mine, oh and that sauce looks amazing. I need to make this soon! </p>
<p> This looks absolutely amazing! Stuffed and rolled pinwheel flank steaks are one of my go-to grilling summer dishes, but I’ve never figured out how to bring them inside for the months when our grill is covered with snow. Can’t wait to give this a try! </p>
<p> Thank you, Julie! Yes, this dish is adaptable to a whole flank steak too. Hope you enjoy! </p>
<p> It looks absolutely absolutely delicious. One of our very family favorites. Your meat and sauce look perfect!! Great job. </p>
<p> Your version of beef braciole looks great! This is always such a fun dish for those nights when I’m craving a great Italian dish without the extra carbs from pasta. Love the inspiration from the Sopranos too! </p>
<p> We love a great braciole…. my husbands mother was so good at it that Ive never really tried to make one. But its one of the recipes we never thought to have her write down. Im going to give this one a try and surprise Jeff…. and ps… your photography always makes me hungry! Beautiful! </p>
<p> Thanks, Michele! Making the rolls takes a little bit of doing, but the whole dish is soooo worth it! </p>
<p> This recipe looks fabulous. It’s a little sophisticated, but is still totally Italian comfort food. I’m going to be trying this one out on my family! </p>

<p> Beef info </p>
<p> While veal is traditionally more popular than beef in Italy there are a number of classic Italian beef dishes – think carpaccio and ragù – which more than pull their weight in the country's culinary canon. Whether you're planning on simmering chunks of beef in a sauce or serving slivers of juicy, rare steak as a starter, remember that spending a little more on the best quality beef available is a worthy taste investment. </p>
<p> Browse this varied collection of beef recipes for some meaty inspiration for your next meal. Emanuele Scarello creates a ragù from beef mince in his pasta sauce recipe, while Luigi Sartini's beef lasagne recipe is given a kick of colour with sheets of vibrant spinach pasta. For a simple – but stunning – starter recipe try Giorgio and Gian Pietro Damini's Raw beef with tomatoes and mozzarella. </p>

<p> SCOTCH FILLET STEAK </p>
<p> A FLAVOURSOME CUT WHICH IS SOLD WHOLE OR AS STEAKS AND IS PRIZED FOR ITS MARBLING. THIS CUT IS VERY VERSATILE AND CAN BE USED FOR ROASTS, STIR-FRIES OR SIMPLY ON THE BARBECUE. </p>
<p> THE CUT </p>
<p> The scotch fillet is cut from the whole boneless eye of the rib. The cut has a slightly open grain and some marbling in addition to a strip of fat within the lean that runs through the length of the scotch fillet tapering slightly towards the chuck end. </p>
<p> HOW TO COOK </p>
<p> This steak is succulent, tender and full of flavour and is one of the most popular. The ribbons of fat that run through the meat keep it moist and tender while cooking. When pan frying, pat meat dry before cooking. When meat is wet it does not brown well. If you have thinly sliced your scotch fillet steak for stir-fry, coat with flour or spice mixture to keep moisture in and protect the beef while cooking. Try allowing space around your scotch fillet steaks in the pan as overcrowding can reduce the temperature and slow cooking. Sear over a medium-high heat turning only once. The general rule is to allow less time on the second side. Allow the scotch fillet steak to rest before serving, roughly one minute per 100g to allow juices to settle and fibres to relax for the most tender result. </p>

<p> 16 Behind-the-Scenes Secrets to Celebrity Cooking Shows </p>
<p> Almost every foodie loves a cooking show or two. Maybe you adore competition shows, such as Top Chef or Chopped. Perhaps you have a soft spot for Ina Garden or Gordon Ramsay. Sure, some cooking shows are better than others. But celebrity cooking shows can be entertaining. Plus, they expose you to recipes that can help you cook like a master chef at home. </p>
<p> No matter how many cooking shows you watch, you probably know little about how they’re produced. Curious about the behind-the-scenes secrets you’d pick up on the set of your favorite cooking show? Read on to get the inside scoop. </p>
<p> 1. Many chefs don’t formulate their own recipes </p>
<p> Celebrity chefs aren’t all as creative as you think. | Gordon Ramsay via Instagram </p>
<p> Think you’d never make it as a TV chef if you can’t come up with your own recipes? Think again. Reader’s Digest reports many TV chefs don’t develop their own recipes. The publication explains some don’t have the time. Others “are more focused on being on TV than on cooking.” And still others just don’t have the talent for developing new recipes. As with many other aspects of preparing a dish for TV, most celebrity chefs get plenty of help. </p>
<p> 2. Chefs often cut themselves because sous chefs have better knife skills </p>
<p> Executive chefs have forgotten some knife skills. | Alton Brown via Instagram </p>
<p> ABC News learned on the set of Iron Chef, “the cameras never stop rolling — not even when the Kitchen Stadium chefs have an accident.” According to Alton Brown, the competing chefs have proven likely to injure themselves because sous chefs tend to handle knives better. “You know, [the chefs] become big on TV, and they become sloppy with knife skills,” Brown says. “It’s like, ‘Oops! I’ve cut the dickens out of myself.’ You know, blood all over. … Sous chefs are laughing.” </p>
<p> 3. Cooking competitions are a lot more fair than they seem </p>
<p> Everyone gets equal time, despite what you might see on TV. | Christina Tosi via Instagram </p>
<p> When you watch a contest-style cooking show, you might get the impression that judges didn’t spend enough time with one competitor, or they didn’t taste all of the food another prepared. But Christina Tosi of MasterChef and MasterChef Junior tells Lucky Peach things only seem unfair because so much footage gets cut. In fact, cooking competitions are set up to be as fair as possible. “There is a team of standards-and-practices officials who watch the contestants’ every move. Everyone has the exact same advantages,” Tosi says. </p>
<p> 4. Chefs have stylists to make everything look perfect </p>
<p> Food just doesn’t magically look that perfect. | Jamie Oliver via Instagram </p>
<p> We all get disappointed when we follow a recipe, only to cook a dish that doesn’t look anything like it did on TV. Just know it’s not your fault. Reader’s Digest notes celebrity chefs rely on an arsenal of staff — including art directors, prop stylists, food stylists, and assistants — to make everything look perfect. Plus, they plate everything with the intention of making it look gorgeous. Don’t beat yourself up if your version doesn’t look the same. </p>
<p> 5. It can take hours to get the chefs situated </p>
<p> Producers must make sure contestants understand the rules. | Graham Elliot via Instagram </p>
<p> Tosi also explains on MasterChef, “It can take hours to get the cooks in and situated, introduce the challenge, and read the rules.” The reason why? “Everyone needs to start with the same understanding of what the competition is, and we have to confirm they hear every detail of the challenge.” Thanks to high stress levels, chefs often misunderstand a challenge, stop paying attention as the crew reviews everything, or start cooking before it’s actually go time. </p>
<p> 6. Competitors can get writer’s block — but for cooking </p>
<p> Chefs don’t always have a plan right off the bat. | MasterChef via Instagram </p>
<p> You aren’t the only one who looks at the ingredients in your fridge and can’t figure out what to make. Tosi tells Lucky Peach on MasterChef, plenty of competitors get a version of writer’s block — but for cooking. “Or people will go in a direction they think is a great idea, and they’ll realize halfway through it’s a terrible idea — but it’s also incredible to see how people recover,” she says. “… Never when someone is lost do they not produce something — and sometimes the best thing comes out of that. I think when you give yourself limitations, you actually end up being more creative.” </p>
<p> 7. A single episode can take 14 hours to film </p>
<p> It’s so much more than a 30-minute round. | Kathy Fang via Instagram </p>
<p> Delish spoke to chef and Chopped winner Kathy Fang about what it was like to compete on the Food Network show. Among other things, the publication learned it can take 14 hours or more to film a single episode. Contestants need to arrive at the Chopped set around 5:45 a.m. And if they don’t get eliminated, they’ll continue filming until 8 or 9 p.m. And as for the winner? He or she still has to spend an hour or more doing on-camera interviews about the challenge. </p>
<p> 8. Chefs can help each other — or sabotage one another </p>
<p> Some chefs refuse to share ingredients. | Ted Allen via Instagram </p>
<p> Fang also tells Delish contestants on Chopped can either share ingredients with one another or opt to sabotage each other. All contestants have full access to the kitchen. But the kitchen only has one jar of each spice or seasoning. Fang says if you’re the last contestant to start grabbing ingredients, you might not find what you need in the kitchen. “You could yell and ask, ‘Hey, has anybody seen the cumin?’ Some people might tell you to come and get it; some people might decide to hide it,” she reports. </p>
<p> 9. Cooking shows waste tons of food </p>
<p> A lot of the food is just for the cameras. | Wolfgang Puck via Instagram </p>
<p> Thrillist reports that, according to multiple Reddit users who have worked on cooking shows, your favorite shows waste tons of food. That’s not exactly a practice you should emulate in your kitchen. Because food sits out under studio lights for so long, it’s often not safe to eat once filming wraps up. Plus, dishes often get made several times. And, like any other chef, celebrity chefs make mistakes. They burn food. Or they undercook it. And sometimes they drop an entire tray. (We’ve all done that at home.) Plus, staff in a second kitchen often make multiple versions of the same dish. That way, the finished food is already ready for filming. </p>
<p> 10. Some of the drama on cooking shows is manufactured </p>
<p> Drama is not planned, but when it happens it’s encouraged. | Alton Brown via Instagram </p>
<p> Joe Arvin, who competed on Cutthroat Kitchen, tells Chef’s Roll though there’s not any planned drama on the show, the producers encourage it. “The one thing about reality TV game showing, which is what Cutthroat Kitchen is, is that you have to follow all California law regarding game shows,” Arvin says. “Therefore, we had a lawyer on set to ensure that all rules were being followed, and there was nothing too fake about the contestants.” The rules are “extremely strict in regards to providing a real world versus Hollywood produced experience.” </p>
<p> 11. On many cooking competitions, chefs can’t look up recipes </p>
<p> Chefs are expected to know their recipes. | Elise Mayfield via Instagram </p>
<p> A.V. Club learned on Master Chef, contestants can’t reference recipes when they’re putting a dish together. Contestant Elise Mayfield tells the publication chefs can’t have recipes, even when they’re baking. “No recipes. It’s scary. There are moments when you’re like, ‘Oh my god, it worked!’ I don’t know any other way to explain it other than that it is amazing what the human brain can remember when you’re under pressure.” Mayfield says she memorized recipes for baked items, including cakes and biscuits. </p>
<p> 12. Nobody actually eats the food you see on TV </p>
<p> What you see cooking often is not what’s eaten. | Giada DeLaurentiis via Instagram </p>
<p> Another cooking show secret that comes courtesy of Reddit? Judges on contest-style shows don’t actually eat the food you see cooked and plated. That version gets thrown away. And a different version is cooked specifically for them to take two or three bites (and then throw away). Plus, many dishes you see on TV are actually inedible. They’re often sprayed, painted, and otherwise manipulated with chemicals to make them look more appealing — or to make them last longer under the studio lights. </p>
<p> 13. The staff does all of the prep work ahead of time </p>
<p> A “30-minute meal” on many cooking shows could actually take days and several chefs to prepare. | Mario Batali via Instagram </p>
<p> Ever wonder how celebrity chefs manage to make a complicated dinner in just 30 minutes? Simple. According to Reddit users, somebody else does all of the prep work. Plus, all of that cleaning, chopping, marinating, and prepping gets done ahead of time. In fact, on some shows, a food stylist actually does most of the cooking (not the chef who hosts the show). And when somebody makes a mistake, they reset and start all over again. Think the food actually gets cooked in the amount of time you see on the show? Not a chance. HowStuff Works notes as many as 20 people help prepare each dish for a cooking show. And the Food Network kitchen, for instance, has five separate kitchens. </p>
<p> 14. They aren’t cooking in their real homes or kitchens </p>
<p> No, you’re not seeing all that home cooking done at the celebrity chefs’ homes. | Rachael Ray via Instagram </p>
<p> You might assume a cooking show gives you a look into the kitchen your favorite celebrity chef has at home. But Reader’s Digest reports that’s rarely the truth. The chef is almost always cooking on a set in New York or Los Angeles. And when the show finishes filming for the season, a crew packs up the set. The crew often shoots an entire season of a show in just a few days or weeks. Although it seems like you’re seeing a chef’s kitchen evolve over the course of a season, all you’re seeing is a set that’s strategically decorated and staged. </p>
<p> 15. Cooking competitions are a lot like real kitchen life </p>
<p> The pace and pressure on many cooking shows is like real kitchen work. | Michael Vignola via Instagram </p>
<p> Although contest shows, such as Chopped, might seem pretty different from working in a real kitchen, many chefs say there are several similarities. In both situations, chefs have to work well under pressure and respond to all kinds of unforeseen situations. Michael Vignola, a Chopped contestant, tells Tasting Table, “This show is real. There’s no stop and go. It’s very much like real kitchen life, and you have to just make it happen.” </p>
<p> 16. Many celebrity chefs don’t eat the food they prepare </p>
<p> Some chefs spit out their food between takes. | Giada de Laurentiis via Instagram </p>
<p> Wonder how Giada de Laurentiis stays so thin while cooking rich Italian food? According to Page Six, she doesn’t eat the food she cooks on her show. In fact, she reportedly spits out food after tasting it on camera. De Laurentiis has said she stays thin by eating in moderation. So even when she does eat a few bites of a dish prepared on the show, she probably doesn’t eat the whole dish. </p>

<p> The best chef's knives </p>
<p> Unlike several kitchen tasks, cutting, chopping, slicing and dicing is still mostly done by hand. While many of us have modernised our kitchens with high-tech toasters, smoothie machines and slow cookers, possibly the most ancient device of all, the knife, remains. </p>
<p> "There is no object you own that is anything like your kitchen knife," writes Tim Hayward in Knife: The Cult, Craft and Culture of the Cook's Knife. "Every day you pick it up and use it to create and transform. Eight inches of lethally sharp, 'weapons-grade' metal lying on your kitchen table, possessing the same potential for mayhem as a loaded handgun – and yet it is predominantly used to express your love for your family by making their tea." </p>
<p> Unlike other utensils, knives require time and effort (to master the techniques), and love and care (to ensure they remain in top condition for years). Perhaps it's unsurprising they inspire an almost cult-like following. </p>
<p> The most important knife is the all-purpose, versatile, sturdy, roughly eight-inch chef's knife. While manufacturers flog expensive knife sets, all the experts I spoke to recommend forking out (sorry) on a good chef's knife. Knives you might also want include a carving knife, a paring knife and a bread knife. However, you don't need the several iterations of the same blade you get with a set. </p>
<p> The chef's knife – or cook's knife – can be used for anything from slicing onions, chopping herbs and crushing garlic to mincing meat. The main style we use today is developed from French and German traditions, though, increasingly, Japanese knives – with thinner blade and curved spine – are popular. </p>
<p> Our testing focused on Western-style knives, with some Japanese options thrown in. We asked experts including chefs, manufacturers and enthusiasts; and then reviewed the options within a price range of roughly £30-£150. While it's hard to determine durability from a few weeks' testing (all knives must be properly looked after to remain functional, more of which later), we reviewed them in terms of: weight, comfort of handle, balance, aesthetics, ease of use and more. Sharpness is of course paramount, but all the knives we tested arrive incredibly sharp; treating them well will keep them in top condition. </p>
<p> As Hayward writes: "The day you go out and intentionally drop £50 or more on a knife is the day you declare to the world that you're not just someone who makes dinner, you're now a cook." </p>
<p> Here is our pick of the best chef's knives available to buy, including both Western and Japanese styles. </p>
<p> 1. Wüsthof classic cook's knife, 20cm </p>
<p> Why we like it: It's the best all-rounder; a real workhorse </p>
<p> Wüsthof have been making knives in Solingen, the "City of Blades", since 1814, and their precisely made blades have received plaudits from the likes of Tim Hayward. </p>
<p> While it was quite tough to choose a winner in a high-quality field, this knife stood out for me. The key reasons are sturdiness and balance – it just felt right in my hand. When held by the bolster (the lump in the middle, between the blade and the handle), neither the blade nor the handle felt overly weighty, a sign of a well-balanced knife. </p>
<p> I like the very classic French-German look, with full tang and the three visible rivets. The blade curves up at the end, which makes certain tasks a little easier, particularly quickly mincing herbs. The handle, while not rounded, is incredibly smooth, so none of the edges dig into the palm. And the bolster is nicely curved to fit the middle finger underneath, with thumb placed comfortably on the blade. </p>
<p> The Wüsthof felt heavier in the hand than some others I tried, but not overly so. This gave it a feeling of sturdiness and made me more confident in chopping and slicing vegetables and meat, for which this knife is perfect. The blade, which has a Rockwell rating of 56, and is sturdy enough to crush garlic cloves without fear of snapping. (The Rockwell test measures the hardness of steel, 53 is about as low as it gets for knives, and is soft, relatively speaking; 64 is on the upper end, and is hard but brittle). </p>
<p> Overall, a quality knife that I felt encouraged me to hold it in the correct manner, due to the positioning and smoothness of the bolster and heel, and allowed me to chop, slice, cut and dice my way to a more enjoyable kitchen experience. </p>
<p> 2. Kai Shun classic scalloped santoku knife, 18cm </p>
<p> OK, I'll admit it. Part of why I like this knife so much is aesthetic. The smooth, black, Pakkawood handle, which blends seamlessly into the blade; the heel that juts out at a right angle; the subtle, tiger-like patterning of the Damascus steel (32 layers, apparently); the deep scalloping; the slightly curved blade. It really is a thing of beauty. </p>
<p> But looks alone do not a good knife make. Thankfully, the Kai Shun is very comfortable, balanced and sturdy, due to its full tang. As with most Japanese knives, it's lighter than many of the chef's knives I tried, but it doesn't feel flimsy in any way, perhaps thanks to a Rockwell rating of 64. </p>
<p> I found it remarkably easy to slice soft or hard vegetables and meat incredibly finely, in no small part due to the 15° edge of the blade (Western knives tend to be angled at around 20° on both sides). If you were making a dauphinoise, or something else requiring thinly-cut potatoes, this does the trick with ease. </p>
<p> The lightness means you can get through quite a lot without tiring the wrists or arms out. However, I didn't find cutting in a rocking motion, a method I often use for herbs, to be as effortless as with the Wüsthof. </p>
<p> The scalloping does indeed work, and vegetables stuck a lot less to this blade than some others I tried. The handle, being right-handed, was a joy to hold. It's also an inch shorter than most of the others I tried, making it a little less daunting. It is, however, rather expensive, and Japanese knives tend to be harder to sharpen, because of their angled blade. You can't, for example, run it through a conventional kitchen V-shaped knife sharpener. </p>
<p> 3. Mercer Culinary Genesis 10-inch chef's knife </p>
<p> Mercer claim to supply over 90pc of North American culinary academies with kitchen gadgets, so one would expect their knives to be sturdy, durable, sharp and comfortable – ideal, then, for the budding chef. </p>
<p> If you don't want to spend £50 or more on a chef's knife, I'd highly recommend this Mercer blade. It feels just as sturdy to hold as a pricier model, though it is a tad heavier. It is well balanced, however. The handle is made of Santoprene, a thermoplastic rubber, which I can't fault for its non-slip grip and comfort. The Rockwell rating is 58, and it has a full tang. </p>
<p> In looks, I found it a little more pedestrian than the aesthetically pleasing Japanese or German knives, with its long, relatively straight blade. The heel, however, has a good curve, allowing you to rest your middle finger on it comfortably. Chopping all manner of vegetables and meat was easy, though I didn't find getting precise, thin slices as seamless as with the top two knives in this guide. And veg and herbs did stick quite a lot to the blade. </p>
<p> If you're only looking to spend £50 or so, however, I'd suggest the Mercer Genesis. </p>
<p> 4. TOG Knives santoku knife, 17cm </p>
<p> TOG knives is a British-designed brand with blades are handmade in Seki, the home of Samurai swords in Japan. These beautifully made specialist knives are part of a growing trend for high-quality kitchen tools, along with the likes of Blenheim Forge and Savernake Knives. </p>
<p> TOG have attracted a number of top, Michelin-starred chefs, as much for their sturdiness and sharpness as their beauty. "If you are looking to invest in only one quality knife in your lifetime, you should seriously consider a TOG," says Graham Garrett of the Michelin-starred The West House Restaurant in Kent. Sat Bains is also a fan. </p>
<p> First thing to say is that, upon opening the box, you'll be met with a stunning product. The dark maple handle, etched with traditional patterns, is a sight to behold. It's comfortable to grip, and very well balanced in the hand. </p>
<p> But, most importantly, the knife cuts well. It's got a razor-sharp, all-purpose blade that is equally as useful with meat as with fruit and veg. Chiffonading herbs is easy as can be. </p>
<p> There's no doubt it's a wonderful knife, one that'll last you a long time if treated well. Its superb balance inspired confidence in the user. I found it a little light to my liking, but I know many people who find chef's knives intimidating, so this could be the one for them. It's also rather expensive, but there's no doubting the quality. </p>
<p> 5. F. Dick 1905 fully forged chef's knife, 21.5cm </p>
<p> Another ancient German knife manufacturer, indeed one mentioned by Anthony Bourdain in Kitchen Confidential. I loved the unique design of the handle, with three steel rings providing the rivets. It's a rather heavy knife, which I like, but some might not. It's strong, too, with a Rockwell rating of 56. The blade curves at the end in the German fashion, which is useful for chopping in a rocking motion. The bolster is well position for gripping the handle and blade, though the handle isn't quite as comfortable to hold as the Wüsthof. A good knife, if a little pricey. </p>
<p> 6. Zwilling Pro santoku knife, 18cm </p>
<p> Chef Scott Smith, of Fhior in Edinburgh, is a big fan of Zwilling knives, another company founded in Solingen eons ago. "I find they are well made, well weighted, and you get the impression they really invest in making a quality product," says Smith. </p>
<p> This marriage of Japanese style with German craft certainly makes for a good knife. The blade shape is very much Japanese, but the handle looks Western, with its three visible rivets, and it has a full tang and a Rockwell rating of 57, meaning its less brittle than your classic santoku. The scalloping is pretty effective, too. </p>
<p> I found the blade very fine and sharp, useful for getting precise, wafer-thin slices. It was significantly heavier than the Kai Shun, which lost it a couple of brownie points, and it doesn't look as appealing. But it is significantly cheaper, has a nicely angled heel which I found comfortable to place my middle finger in, and the bolster is smooth and angled perfectly for my thumb to rest in. The handle wasn't as snug as the Kai Shun, however. Performance wise, there were no qualms. A solid Japanese-style knife. </p>
<p> 7. Victorinox Fibrox carving knife, 25cm </p>
<p> Victorinox, who make the famous Swiss Army knives, come recommended by most experts as a good beginner's option. "They are good all-rounders, and easy to sharpen," says chef Richard Bainbridge. Knife manufacturer Laurie Timpson adds: "pound for pound, they're probably the best value knives you'll get." Chef Henry Harris chips in, saying "I always tell young chefs to look at Victorinox." </p>
<p> It's probably a good bet to trust the experts, and you can certainly pick up some very affordable knives from the Swiss brand. I found this knife (nominally a carving knife, but with a blade as wide as a chef's knife and it works just as well), hit and miss. On the one hand, it's very sharp out of the box, and cuts through meat and vegetables very easily. </p>
<p> However, it did feel a little lightweight, like it might snap if putting too much force into your chopping. It's also not as comfortable to hold, probably because it's designed as a carving knife, so you have to hold the handle with your hold hand. The blade was also significantly heavier than the handle. It is by no means a bad knife, (you will be able to cut whatever you need) and it's worth browsing through Victorinox's range. It just doesn't feel as sturdy as the others I tried. </p>
<p> Chef's knife FAQ </p>
<p> Why buy a chef's knife? </p>
<p> A chef's knife is an all-purpose, versatile knife with a blade that usually measures around seven to nine inches. Long blades can be a bit intimidating to newbies (I was certainly a bit daunted at first), but you'll quickly grow accustomed. Of course, cooking is personal, and if you want to do all your chopping and slicing with a small paring knife, that's your prerogative. </p>
<p> A chef's knife, however, will become your most important kitchen utensil. According to Justin Kowbel, co-founder of Borough Kitchen cookshop, you'll use it about 70pc of the time, so it's worth spending a little more for a quality blade. "You can get away with just two knives if you have a good chef's knife," Kowbel says. </p>
<p> Speaking with several chefs in researching this article, it became clear that cooks build a real bond with their knife. Richard Bainbridge, chef owner of Benedicts Restaurant in Norwich, says: "Your knife is your old friend that sticks with you through thick and thin. If you want to cook well, build a relation with your knives." Scott Smith of Fhior in Edinburgh agrees. "Your knife is the most fundamental tool of your craft, you need to look after it the best you can. The oldest knife I have is 13 years old. When you have a knife for that long it becomes an extension of you – you understand the weight, become comfortable with its size and using it becomes second nature," says Smith. </p>
<p> Few chefs are as infatuated by knives as Henry Harris, chef-director of The Hero of Maida, The Coach and Three Cranes. Harris owns around 100, and uses a dozen or so regularly. "A sharp knife, and the right knife for the task at hand, is the chef's most important tool," Harris adds. With a very good nakiri (a Japanese vegetable knife), Harris explains, you can chop onions without spraying juice everywhere, meaning you won't cry – the same can be said for a good, sharp chef's knife. </p>
<p> Chef's knives aren't perfect for everything . You may struggle to carve meat, peel a potato or slice bread – and, for me, a paring knife works better for mincing garlic, for example. But for your overall, everyday chopping, it's a real workhorse. </p>
<p> What are the most important features to look out for? </p>
<p> There are several important features determining a good knife. A sharp, robust blade is paramount. Good-quality steel (most tested are stainless steel, which is easier to look after, but carbon and Damascus steel are having a resurgence) is sharp, durable, easy to clean, strong and flexible. Ceramic knives – sharp but brittle – haven't been included in this test. </p>
<p> "Comfort and balance are absolutely key," says Laurie Timpson, founder of Savernake Knives, which produces handmade knives in Wiltshire. When holding a well-balanced knife properly, with forefinger near the heel, it should feel equally weighted on each side, so neither the blade nor handle is significantly heavier than the other. </p>
<p> A good handle is crucial for comfort. It should be smooth with no jagged edges, but the material shouldn't affect the overall quality. It could be a grippy silicone, a beautiful wood, or Pakkawood – just make sure it sits comfortably in your hand. </p>
<p> Weight should also be considered. You don't want something too heavy. If doing long shifts – cutting for half an hour or more – something too cumbersome will eventually tire you out. "Lightweight knives are easier to move around and less tiring. If you have a sharp knife, it's your muscles rather than the weight of the blade that's doing the cutting. A heavy knife is to be avoided," Timpson explains. </p>
<p> On the other hand, a light and flimsy knife isn't great either. Cheap knives tend to be light – as do very expensive ones (though light and sturdy rather than light and flimsy). Mid-range blades can be a bit heavier, but none of those tested were too weighty. </p>
<p> What material should the knife blade be? </p>
<p> Stainless steel, carbon steel, Damascus steel and ceramic are the most common types of chef's knife blades. Carbon steel and Damascus steel knives are making a comeback, with artisan manufacturers producing beautiful tools, like Blenheim Forge in London or Joel Black in Herefordshire. </p>
<p> Carbon steel looks rustic, and stays sharp for longer than stainless steel. But it rusts quite easily and is difficult to maintain. "Some people like the patterning on the side, it develops a story and a patina that looks rustic," says Timpson. "If you like that sort of stuff, go for it, but I can't see the point." They can also be quite expensive. </p>
<p> Damascus steel, also known as wootz, was a historic method of blending strong brittle steel with soft, malleable, ductile steel, in order to get a perfect blend. "This was fantastic for the time," says Timpson. They are currently popular for their beautiful patterning, and high-end manufacturers make very good ones. "I'd still suggest if you've got a really high-tech blade, made from one homogenous bit of really good quality steel, it will outperform the Damascus," says Timpson, who focuses on stainless steel at his Wiltshire workshop. </p>
<p> Why go for stainless steel? Firstly, it's pretty good at resisting rust and corrosion, unlike carbon steel. Stainless steel is softer, which means it's easier to sharpen – although this can mean they'll lose their edge quicker than carbon steel. They are fairly durable and won't chip or rust easily. As they don't require a protective non-stick coating, it's unlikely the knife will alter the taste of your food. </p>
<p> "Cheap stainless steel is terrible," Timpson explains. "It's not very durable, nasty to get an edge on, and can't be hardened. But if you buy a really good stainless steel these days, in terms of being able to take an edge, hold the edge, get sharp and all of that, a good stainless steel will be identical to good carbon steel." </p>
<p> Does it need to be forged? </p>
<p> Knives can be cast or forged. Casting involves pouring molten metal into a mould and waiting for it to harden; forging indicates a piece of metal is heated until soft then bashed into place. Brands often make a big song and dance about forged knives, but it isn't necessarily an indicator of quality. It can be handmade, with a master craftsman in a cavernous workshop hammering it into shape. "It's a very skilled thing to do," Timpson says. </p>
<p> But many mass-produced, machine-made knives are also forged. Big machines will get a piece of molten metal and stamp it. "Look at a machine-made knife, perhaps a Wüsthof Dreizack Classic," writes Hayward. "It has been forged by giant machines exerting unimaginable force, ground by computer-guided mills precise to a micron in their choreography. This is one of those objects that represents the pinnacle of what human science, design and technology can achieve." </p>
<p> Timpson agrees that mass manufactured forged knives (which make up most of those tested) can be done very well. "I just wouldn't get excited by things being forged just because they say they're forged. It's not the be all and end all," he says. </p>
<p> What's better: a Japanese or Western knife? </p>
<p> There are countless knife traditions around the world, each developed over centuries to cater to a particular culture, cuisine, or aesthetic. Western knives have developed mainly from French and German traditions. French knives tend to have straighter blades, while German-style knives curve along the cutting edge. Increasingly, Japanese-style knives are becoming popular in Western kitchens, but what are the main differences? </p>
<p> While there is plenty of crossover these days (Japanese-style knives are commonly made in Europe, incorporating typically Western features), there are still some defining features. Western knives tend to use a softer steel (measured by the Rockwell scale: 53 is very soft, 64 is hard but brittle). There will also be a full tang, meaning the knife will have a spike coming out of the end of the blade, onto which a handle is attached. Western knives tend to be heavier too. </p>
<p> The advantage of a softer steel is that it's easier to hone and keep in top condition. A good Western knife will range from about 56 to 58 on the Rockwell scale, while a Japanese might go up to 64 (hard and brittle, so they can chip easily). </p>
<p> The most popular Japanese-style knife right now is the santoku, which is relatively all-purpose and thus measures up against a Western chef's knife. Japanese knives have a finer-angled blade (around 15-17º compared with around 20º). They often have a single bevel, which means they are only angled on one side of the blade, enabling very fine slicing – ideal for extremely thin potatoes or onions, for example. This means they tend to be right- or left-handed, whereas Western knives are ambidextrous. Japanese knives tend to be harder to sharpen (not helped by the hardness and brittleness). </p>
<p> While they can be a thing of beauty, and incredibly nice to cook with, Timpson warns against going Japanese for the sake of it, as "Japanese isn't necessarily a synonym for quality. A huge number of them are banged out in a factory in Osaka, which is the Japanese equivalent of Reading. They'll have 1,000 years of Samurai tradition written on the box, but it can be a bag of sh*te." Many of the Japanese knives Timpson receives to sharpen are chipped or have a tip missing, mostly because they're used for Western-style cooking, which they're not necessarily geared towards. </p>
<p> Harris, though a big fan of Japanese knives, agrees they're more high maintenance: "the blades are thinner, they require more care, and you can't sharpen them on a steel, unless you want to mess them up." </p>
<p> How to look after your knife </p>
<p> There are several important aspects to knife maintenance: storage, washing, honing and sharpening, as well as using the right chopping boards. Caring for your knife, according to Timpson, is "absolutely vital". The following advice is for stainless steel knives. </p>
<p> Using a wooden or richlite chopping board is preferable to plastic. Never put in a dishwasher, which amounts to "attacking" the knife, as the salt, hot air and water will ruin the edge, if not the side of the blade; it won't come out as sharp as it went in. Hand wash as soon as you've finished using it (Timpson says, if cutting acidic foods like onions, you'd be ill-advised to even pick up the phone and leave your dirty knife behind, as the acid will begin to corrode the blade). After washing, wipe it dry. </p>
<p> Honing and sharpening are crucial to maintaining efficacy – and they're not the same thing. When chopping through produce onto the board, you're not necessarily blunting the blade but, because you won't cut up and down at a perfect angle, it will misalign slightly. Honing brings it back to shape. You should hone regularly – a professional chef will do so every time they cook. "You're not removing any metal, or damaging the knife, just conditioning it," Timpson explains. </p>
<p> Eventually you'll have to sharpen. Timpson reckons a well looked after knife requires sharpening a couple of times a year, with the best method being a whetstone. There are several good instructional videos online, but "not Gordon Ramsay slashing up and down like an idiot." After sharpening, which removes steel, a leather strop will get rid of the burr (the rough leftover edges). </p>
<p> Storing a knife is very easy – don't keep them in a draw. "That's the biggest mistake people make, even some chefs. It's just criminal, you're going to damage the edge or blunt the knives," Harris laments. Rather than expose your knife to a severe bashing in a draw, keep it in a knife block, a bristle block or – my favourite method – on a knife magnet. </p>
<p> Avoid gimmicks </p>
<p> "Knife making isn't rocket science," Timpson says. "If you can't see the point of something, or a manufacturer is trying to explain it to you using things you don't understand, it's probably bulls***. When they bang on about sharpness – I can sharpen a banana to cut a tomato. It's not about how sharp you can get it initially, it's about how sharp is stays." </p>
<p> Timpson points to other things to be wary of, including steel described using various numbers and letters, or magic knives with holes in them. Dimpled knives (scalloped) however, do tend to stick less to the food than non-dimpled, in my experience. </p>

<p> Best Pan To Cook Steak On Stove </p>
<p> As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Thank you! Read my disclosure for more info. </p>
<p> The weather isn’t cooperating, or you don’t have a grill. But you’re craving that perfectly seared steak dinner. What’s the best way to cook your steak on the stove? Use one of the pans on my list to make a pan-seared steak. </p>
<p> Before you start </p>
<p> Before getting into the different types of pans to use to produce the best results on your stove, it is good to know how you want to season your steak before pan-searing it. The pan will really lock in any flavors you throw in it. You should also avoid Teflon and other artificial non-stick coatings. The high heat needed for cooking the steak may actually break down the coating and contaminate your meat, as well as ruining your skillet. </p>
<p> With that in mind, read on to see some of the best types of pans to use for cooking steak on your stove, as well as some product recommendations and tips for maintaining your pan based on the material. </p>
<p> Stainless Steel or Tri-Ply Cookware </p>
<p> Stainless steel is a great, even heat conductor, ensuring an even cook through your steak. Tri-ply cookware is stainless steel layered with a different material (usually copper or aluminum). It’s great because the added materials conduct heat faster, creating a perfect searing atmosphere in the pan for your steak. These pans are also easy to wash and safe to use at the high temperatures required for cooking a steak thoroughly. </p>
<p> Get a good sear on your steak in a cast iron pan. </p>
<p> Cast Iron Frying Pans </p>
<p> Cast iron pans are another great option. They retain the most heat out of all of these materials, ensuring an evenly caramelized, thoroughly and beautifully browned steak. Another plus is the seasoning process for maintaining cast iron ends up building great aromas and flavors over time. </p>
<p> The added step of adding a layer after cleaning to rebuild the polymerized oil coating, is perfect for steak because it helps with the browning and flavoring process for next time! Cast iron is also compatible with all types of stoves and cooktops, which is an important consideration for your kitchen. </p>
<p> Carbon Steel Skillets </p>
<p> Carbon steel is basically a lighter version of cast iron, offering many of the same cooking benefits. They’re perfect for searing and they’re available in several different levels of thickness. The thicker the better for steaks, since those will hold the most heat for the longest amount of time. </p>
<p> While these need to be regularly seasoned like cast iron, they actually retain less heat than cast iron. They’ll need to be preheated longer than a cast iron skillet. </p>
<p> Copper </p>
<p> Finally, one more great pan material for cooking steak is a copper pan. Make sure these are lined with stainless steel though, not tin. Tin will heat up too fast and isn’t great for cooking at the high temperatures required for searing steak. </p>
<p> Recommendations </p>
<p> Stainless Steel: The All-Clad Weeknight Pan from Amazon is a great steak pan because it’s a frying pan with deep sides. This makes it extremely versatile and a great investment (albeit, expensive) for all types of cooking endeavors. Most importantly, it performs perfectly for steak. </p>
<p> Personally, I recommend the Lodge Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Square Grill. I love cast iron. The heat holding-abilities of cast iron are perfect for steak. And this one gives your steak the grill marks without the grill. </p>

<p> Chefs Share: These Are the Top 10 Cookware Brands Worth Buying in 2019 </p>
<p> Gabrielle is the founder of décor site, Savvy Home, and has been a writer and editor for home décor and lifestyle publications for almost 10 years. </p>
<p> Have you ever walked into a vacation rental kitchen to whip up a delicious meal, only to realize that the cookware is not nearly as good as your own? Or maybe you've visited your friends or parents and gushed over how well their cast-iron pan seared your steak? Pots and pans are certainly not made equal—and the options range from big-box starter kits to incredibly high-end heirloom pieces. </p>
<p> With myriad options out there, finding the best pots and pans for your needs is no easy feat if you have no idea where to begin—that's why we asked three NYC-based chefs to enlighten our pot and pan purchases. "I have a few different pots and pans at home, says chef Laurence Edelman of Left Bank in the West Village. "I use them all constantly and for different things. What they all have in common is that they are built to last throughout generations, heavy, stable and even heat conductors." </p>
<p> Ready to give your pots and pans an upgrade? Check out these cookware brands worth buying, according to the pots and pans NYC chefs use. Plus, top-rated cookware picks according to home cooks. </p>
<p> Zwilling </p>
<p> Zwilling VistaClad Ceramic Non-Stick 10-Piece Cookware Set $650 $400 </p>
<p> Zwilling </p>
<p> "The brand I swear by is Zwilling," says Laurent Tourondel, executive chef and founder of Second, L'Amico, and The Vine in New York City. "I bought a 10-piece cookware set a few years back and have been using the brand ever since. I always look for a thick nonstick coating for scratch resistance and lightweight pieces that are easy to travel with." </p>
<p> Staub </p>
<p> Staub </p>
<p> While Touroundel swears by Zwilling for most of his cookware, he also holds a special place for a second brand: "I prefer Staub for a cast-iron skillet," he adds. "Its products transfer and retain heat easily and have a long lifespan." </p>
<p> Le Creuset </p>
<p> Le Creuset Signature Stainless Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set $850 </p>
<p> Le Creuset </p>
<p> For chef Nic Caicedo, executive chef at Harvey at The Williamsburg Hotel, only one brand matters: Le Creuset. "It's durable, easy to clean, looks great, and can be used with a ceramic, induction, electric or gas range," he says. "In general, I'm looking for a flat bottom, a product that can cook food evenly and perfectly and is easy to clean." </p>
<p> Le Creuset Signature Graphite Grey Round Dutch Oven $340 </p>
<p> "What I have the most of is Le Creuset, and if I had to choose only one pot and one pan, they would undoubtedly be Le Creuset," says Edelman, who shares a love for the classic French brand. "I go for the classics—their beautifully enameled iron pots and pans. I use them for braising meats, making sauces, roasting chickens, or making elaborate rice dishes like paellas. There is nothing that they don't do well, and they transfer seamlessly to the dining table." </p>
<p> Mauviel </p>
<p> Mauviel </p>
<p> Edelman also cooks with Mauviel. "I have two sizes of blue steel Mauviel skillets," he says. "One I use solely for eggs and must have cooked over 10,000 eggs in it. The other, I use for searing fish or meat. These pans allow you to build a patina, and they are essentially non-stick at this point." </p>
<p> All-Clad </p>
<p> All-Clad Tri-Ply Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set $1100 $700 </p>
<p> All-Clad </p>
<p> "For boiling pasta, making quinoa or any other grains, or boiling eggs, I generally use my stainless steel All-Clad pots," adds Edelman. "I have a few different sizes (all pretty small and all with lids), and they work really well. I like them because they are light and easy to move around and wash. Also, the lighter material heats up quickly, getting the water boiling in a timely manner. I really love all my pots and pans—they are as important as knives." </p>
<p> And that's not all. The rest of the internet feels very strongly about their cookware brands too. Below, keep scrolling to see what everyday home cooks are cooking with: </p>
<p> Anolon </p>
<p> This mid-range cookware brand is known for its quality nonstick pots and pans; its anodized cookware set racked up an average of 4 of 5 stars (based on over 400 reviews) on Amazon. They're also ideal pans for dishes that start on the stovetop and finish in the oven. Anolon is manufactured by Meyer, which also makes Circulon, Kitchen Aid, and Rachael Ray-branded kitchen products. </p>
<p> Cook N Home </p>
<p> Internet reviewers dig the non-stick qualities of Cook N Home's ceramic coated cookware. "I was a little leery of the ceramic non-stick, but I'm a believer now," one reviewer writes. Reviewers also liked the cookware's retro green color and the versatility of its interchangeable lids. </p>
<p> Cuisinart </p>
<p> Reviewers of Cuisinart's stainless cookware approve of its quick-heating and even cooking properties. Plus, for stainless steel cookware, Cuisinart is one of the more accessible price points on the market. If you're looking for a set that features just the basics, their seven-piece cookware set "is the perfect set for a small, minimalist kitchen. This has all the right sizes of cookwares..." writes one reviewer. </p>
<p> Farberware </p>
<p> With a near-perfect 4.3 star rating on Amazon, reviewers praise Farberware cookware's long shelf-life (one reviewer wrote she's had her set for 40 years) and are particularly fond of its "Classic" series. </p>
<p> T-fal </p>
<p> T-fal's nonstick pots and pans set boasts more than 4,000 Amazon reviews, making it one of the most-loved on the website. One reviewer is impressed that they're "almost as strong as cast iron, at a fraction of the weight," and that they "have all the advantages of cast iron without the need to first season them, will never rust... require heavy scrubbing, and, apparently, will never scratch or dent." Other pluses: They're a cinch to clean, heat quickly, and evenly. </p>
<p> Chef Nic Cardeiro's Guide to Pots and Pans </p>
<p> Build your own cookware set with these chef-approved essentials: </p>
<p> Braising pan: Great for roasting, braising, sautéing, proofing (like waiting for bread to rise, which is part of the fermentation process). Ideal for braising short ribs or chicken. </p>
<p> Sauté pan: Sautéing is one of the best feelings of cooking, especially when you learn how to properly sauté. I love a good stir-fry with julienned onions, red pepper, carrot, garlic, and broccoli. </p>
<p> Cast-iron skillet: For searing a nice piece of steak, a cast-iron skillet—a naturally nonstick surface—is a workhorse. It's great for searing and or roasting. </p>
<p> Saucepan: A saucepan is made for three things: Sauces, sauces, and sauces! It's also great for heating up liquids like milk or water. </p>
<p> Stockpot: A good stock, chicken, for example, will cook for a good five to six hours, lid on, to retain all flavors and aromas. </p>

<p> The One Mistake Nearly Everyone Makes When Pan Searing a Steak </p>
<p> Don't fuss with the grill just to enjoy a juicy steak when you can cook one on your stovetop. </p>
<p> Cooking a restaurant-worthy steak on the stovetop should not be a daunting task. Read through these blunders, resolve to avoid them, and you can pan-sear a gloriously juicy steak dinner in the middle of the week. </p>
<p> You Don't Choose the Right Cut for the Job </p>
<p> When it comes to steaks, a T-bone may be the universal favorite cut of beef, and these are ideal when grilling outside. The best steaks for pan searing on the stovetop, however, are boneless steaks that are between 1 and 11/2-inches thick. Look for a steak with a good bit of marbling, or fat; along with imparting good flavor, fat helps the steak to remain juicy during the cooking process. Pan searing is also a great method to use on thinner steaks, such as flank or flat-iron, but keep in mind the entire cooking process happens much faster. </p>
<p> You Neglect to Prep </p>
<p> Prepping a steak is three easy steps: set it out, dry it, and salt it. Depending on how long you let the steak sit, prepping might actually take longer than the cook time; even so, you can still have a hot and juicy steak dinner ready in anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 ½ hours. Take your steak out of the refrigerator anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour before cook time. (Some cooks cut this time down to 10-15 minutes before cook time.) Place it on a roasting rack or a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry with more paper towels. Season both sides of the meat with a good dosing of medium grain kosher or sea salt. If you think you have added enough salt, go ahead and salt a little more, as a lot of salt grains will fall off into the pan during cooking. Save the pepper or steak seasoning until you take the steak off the heat, because the extremely hot pan (see the next topic below) will burn these spices before they have a chance to flavor the steak. Some cooks will salt the steak and let it sit out a mere 10 to 15 minutes. Use this time to prepare a side dish or toss a salad to accompany the steak at mealtime. </p>
<p> You Pick the Wrong Skillet </p>
<p> You need to cook your steak in a really hot skillet so reach for one that can withstand high temperatures, such as a heavy weight non-stick or the much-loved classic cast iron skillet. Heat it over high heat for about 10 minutes or until the skillet starts to smoke. The intense heat is key to a creating a nice crust on your steak. </p>
<p> You Forget to Flip and Flavor </p>
<p> Place the steak in the hot skillet and cook on the first side until enough of a crust has formed that the steak no longer sticks to the pan, about 1 minute. Flip and cook on the other side for 1 minute, or until that side does not stick. Some steak aficionados will tell you to flip only once, others advise to flip two or three times, cooking on each side for 1 minute before flipping. Choose your own method but, after about 4 minutes, add some butter (onions, herbs, garlic, etc. can go in now) to the pan. As it melts, tilt the pan so the butter pools on one side, and use a spoon to scoop the butter and drizzle it over the steak. You can flip again and continue to baste, checking internal temp after 5-6 minutes. Cook to your desired degree of doneness. </p>
<p> WATCH: The Southern Gentleman's Pan-Seared Skirt Steak & Chimichurri </p>
<p> You Rush the Finish </p>
<p> Once your steak has reached your preferred temp, transfer it to a platter and season with more kosher or sea salt, pepper and steak seasonings. Let it rest for 5 minutes (if you simply can't resist, it is ok to cut into it at this point), slice against the grain, and serve. </p>

<p> A Chef Says This Is the Best Way to Chop an Onion </p>
<p> Here's a safe and efficient way to dice an onion so you get the most out of the root vegetable. </p>
<p> A lot of recipes call for chopped onion, such as stir-fry, curry, chili, and even taco soup (not to mention it makes a great burger and sandwich topper). You may have never considered that there is a right or wrong way to chopping onions, and technically, there is no one right way—everyone has got their own technique and different methods. For example, maybe you use a vegetable chopper to get the job done, or maybe superior knife skills are your go-to method. If those two don't apply to you though, there's no need to fret, because there is a way to successfully chop an onion that just about anyone can do. We consulted head chef of Hello Fresh, Claudia Sidoti, for insight on how to chop an onion at home safely and with minimal tools. You'll be dicing in no time! </p>
<p> What's the best way to chop an onion? </p>
<p> Here's how Sidoti recommends chopping the root vegetable. </p>
<p> 1. Slice off the stem and the thin part of the root on the opposite end. 2. Cut vertically through the middle of the root all the way to the bulb. 3. Peel the skin off the onion. If necessary, you can peel off the outer layer if you can't seem to get the skin off any other way. 4. Once peeled, take one half and place it on the cutting board. Make vertical cuts, making sure to leave the root intact. 5. Dice your onion using horizontal cuts (about 1/4 inch thick). 6. Repeat with the other half of the onion. </p>
<p> What other tips may be helpful while cutting onions? </p>
<p> Piercing an onion inevitably invites a burn to your eyes, followed by a steady stream of tears. Fortunately, it is totally possible for you to cut an onion without crying. Sidoti suggests chilling the onion in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes before breaking out the knives and starting to dice away. </p>
<p> "This reduces the amount of the acid enzyme released into the air," she explains. She then suggests soaking the onion in water, and, most importantly, she says it's best to chop onions with a sharp knife. </p>
<p> "A sharper knife will cause less damage to cell walls, allowing fewer irritants to be released," Sidoti says. </p>
<p> There you have it, instructions on how to chop an onion—and how do it without sobbing the whole way through. Can't you just smell the onions cooking already? </p>

<p> The Best Way to Cut an Onion </p>
<p> Food & Wine's Kelsey Youngman explains the secret to slicing and dicing onions like a pro. </p>
<p> Cutting onions can be a huge pain. Their round shape makes them susceptible to moving around on the cutting board; the strong, sharp smell reliably makes your eyes water. While we don’t have a foolproof hack to prevent the crying, we do know the absolute best way to cut an onion (and no, it doesn’t involve a Slap Chopper). In this video, Food & Wine’s Associate Food Editor Kelsey Youngman guides viewers step-by-step through three basic onion preparations—dice, sauté slice, and salad slice. Her methods are safe and simple, and also provide uniform results, which ensures even cooking. </p>
<p> Dice </p>
<p> Great for: soups and stews, sofrito or mirepoix, and sauces. </p>
<p> Start by stabilizing the onion on the board. Then take your knife and pinch it at the end before the hilt, and use your other hand to stabilize as you slice the onion in half. Don’t cut it horizontally in half, but rather, from top to bottom, so the root stays intact. Trim off part of the flowering stem on one end and remove the strands from the root on the other. </p>
<p> Next, remove the papers and put the onion near the end of the board. Make horizontal slices first, almost to the root but not quite, and then cut across. Once those scores are made and you cut across the top of the onion, you’ll end up with even diced pieces. </p>
<p> Sauté slice </p>
<p> Use this cut when a recipe calls for thinly sliced onions. You start off the same way as the dice, by cutting the onion in half. However, in this case, you want to remove the entire root. Then use the lines on the onion as a guide and slice along them with your knife, letting it rock on the board so it does the work for you. </p>
<p> Salad slice </p>
<p> Great for: salads, sandwiches, eating raw. </p>
<p> Kelsey says the salad slice, also known as the half moon cut, is great for eating raw because it cuts against the grain of the onion, making it easier to break down in your mouth. Like the sauté slice, you want to cut off the root entirely; unlike the sauté slice, you want to ignore the guiding lines on the onions and slice the opposite way, creating thin half moons. </p>

<p> 15 Minute Easy Boneless Pork Chops </p>
<p> This post may contain affiliate links. Please read the disclosure policy. </p>
<p> 2082shares </p>
<p> These pan-fried Boneless Pork Chops are a juicy and flavorful meal that’ll be on your table in just 15 minutes, with no marinating or breading required. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner! </p>
<p> We make these pork chops when we want a quick meal the entire family will enjoy, picky eaters included! There are never any leftovers, so it’s become one of our go-to boneless pork chop recipes. </p>
<p> Boneless pork chop recipes </p>
<p> Boneless pork chop recipes are great for so many reasons: they’re low carb, budget-friendly and easy to cook! These sautéed pork chops are the skillet version of our popular Baked Boneless Pork Chops and have just 275 calories per 6-oz (170g) serving. </p>
<p> The key is ensuring they turn out juicy and tender instead of dry and chewy. By following the tips in this post, you can forget about dry and tough chops forever. Tender and juicy guaranteed! </p>
<p> How to cook boneless pork chops </p>
<p> Season the pork chops before cooking to tenderize the meat. Then heat your skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pork chops and cook for 7-8 minutes, flipping every minute. </p>
<p> Frequent flipping is the key to tender chops! This technique prevents the exterior of your pork chops from overcooking or burning while the interior gets cooked through. You’ll get more evenly cooked meat with a nice and golden brown crust. </p>
<p> When you’ve done this once or twice, it’ll become second-nature and you can bid farewell to dry pork chops forever! </p>
<p> What can you season pork chops with? </p>
<p> You can season your pork chops simply with salt and ground black pepper, but I add paprika and garlic powder for extra flavor. There’s no need for breadcrumbs or brown sugar, since the flavors stand on their own already. </p>
<p> This 4-ingredient pork chop seasoning lends amazing flavor and happens to be keto, gluten-free and Whole30! I like to use regular paprika, which has a sweet peppery flavor and bright vibrant color, but you can also use smoked paprika if you wish. </p>
<p> How to tell when are pork chops done? </p>
<p> Pork chops are done at an internal temperature of 145°F / 63°C, measured by an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the middle. You can actually remove them from the heat at 140°F / 60°C, as the temperature keeps rising while resting. </p>
<p> The meat may still have some wisps of pink in the center, according to the USDA. In fact, pork that’s turned completely white may already be overcooked! </p>
<p> Tips for tender and juicy boneless pork chops </p>
<p> Thick-cut pork chops that are 1 – 1 ½ inches (2 ½ – 4 cm) thick are the best, as they’re less likely to dry out than thin chops. </p>
<p> Season generously with salt to help tenderize the meat. If you’ve brined your chops, don’t add salt any more. </p>
<p> Avoid overcooking the chops to make sure they don’t dry out. Let them sit for 20 minutes at room temperature before cooking, and remove them from heat as soon as they reach 140°F (60°C). Also let the pork chops rest covered for 3-5 minutes after cooking so the juices can redistribute through the meat. </p>
<p> What goes with boneless pork chops </p>
<p> You can serve pork chops with rice, potatoes or noodles for dinner. Pair with side dishes such as broccoli, green beans, corn and salad. </p>
<p> More pork chop recipes: </p>
<p> If you prefer to bake your pork chops, use the same seasoning and follow our Baked Boneless Pork Chops recipe. </p>
<p> Boneless Pork Chop Recipe </p>
<p> These pan-fried Boneless Pork Chops are a juicy and flavorful meal that’ll be on your table in just 15 minutes, with no marinating or breading required. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner! </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Remove the pork chops from the fridge 20 minutes ahead of time. (This helps them to reach room temperature for even cooking.) </p>
<p> Pat dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Set aside. </p>
<p> In a small bowl, mix garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper. (If your pork chops is brined, you can omit the salt.) </p>
<p> Rub the chops on all sides with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Then rub in the seasoning mixture evenly on all sides. </p>
<p> Place a large cast iron pan on medium-high heat. When hot, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and swirl the pan to coat. </p>
<p> Add the pork chops and fry until the internal temperature reaches 140°F / 60°C**, flipping every minute to prevent overheating. </p>
<p> Cooking time will be about 6-7 minutes in total (about 3-4 minutes PER SIDE) for 1-inch chops 1-inch chops*** (see notes for other thicknesses). Add optional thyme to the pan halfway through. </p>
<p> Remove from heat and transfer the pork chops to a plate. Cover with foil or a plate and let rest for 3-5 minutes to let the juices redistribute through the meat. </p>
<p> Garnish with optional minced parsley before serving. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> * Regular refined olive oil is preferable, as it has a higher smoke point than extra virgin olive oil. </p>
<p> ** Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the middle of the chop. Once it reads 140°F / 60°C, remove from heat, as the temperature will rise to the safe level of 145°F / 63°C while resting. It's ok if the center of your pork chop is slightly pink at this temperature. </p>
<p> Store leftover boneless pork chops in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat on medium-low heat for 5-7 minutes or in the microwave for 3-4 minutes on 50% power. </p>
<p> 11 comments on “15 Minute Easy Boneless Pork Chops” </p>
<p> Awesome chops! Best I’ve made. Used 1 1/2 in. thick, boneless chops. Salt brined them 3 hours. Then followed recipe exactly. So good! </p>

<p> Bring Easter tradition to the table with lamb chop meal </p>
<p> While many families’ Easter celebrations may be simpler this year, there’s no reason you can’t still prepare a meal steeped in tradition. Lamb has been an Easter favorite for centuries, and this no-fuss recipe from the American Lamb Board is sure to provide a flavorful meal. With less time spent in the kitchen, you can put the focus back on enjoying time with family. Pan-fried Lamb Chops 12 lamb chops, about 1½” thick 1½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided 2 tablespoons grapeseed or canola oil ½ cup fresh parsley, finely chopped 2 tablespoons fresh oregano, finely chopped 1-2 medium garlic cloves, minced 1 teaspoon lemon zest ¼ teaspoon Dijon mustard 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil Preheat oven to 400°, and heat a large pan over high heat until very hot. Season lamb chops on both sides with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper. Once the pan is hot, add grapeseed or canola oil. Sear the lamb in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook lamb for 2 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook 1 minute more. Transfer cooked lamb to a rimmed baking sheet. While the lamb is cooking, make a sauce with the remaining ingredients. In a small bowl, combine parsley, oregano, garlic, lemon zest, mustard, ½ teaspoon kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper. Drizzle in extra virgin olive oil, then whisk to combine ingredients. Place 1 teaspoon of sauce on top of each lamb rib chop, then roast in the oven for 2-4 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 130° for medium rare or 150° for medium. Allow lamb to rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. Source: American Lamb Board </p>

<p> Difference Between British, Italian & American Suits | Different Suit Styles & Cuts For Men </p>
<p> We all do things a little differently. </p>
<p> The idea in question for this article? </p>
<p> Suits. </p>
<p> A journey that will teach us a great deal about men’s fashion, as we know it today. </p>
<p> We will be exploring three different times in the history of men’s apparel. </p>
<p> Three important turns of events that saw the rise of three iconic garments: </p>
<p> The British, Italian and American suit. </p>
<p> You might be already aware of the existence of these three styles, maybe know some of the obvious differences. But by the end of this journey, you will not only know a great deal of important details about them (that will help you make more conscious choices when purchasing a new suit) but you will understand what made them the way they are. </p>
<p> Who the creative and visionary minds behind each and every one of them were. And most of all, how close men’s fashion is related to history, society and above all, the people and their particular nature. </p>
<p> So buckle up. Wear your most vintage outfit. And back we go to mid 19-th century Mayfair District, London, in a street called Savile Row. </p>
<p> This is a guest post by Mario Natella. Mario is a student who is currently studying Aerospace Engineering. Mario’s father, Domenico, was an Italian Tailor for many years. </p>
<p> The wisdom he passed down to his son is being depicted through Mario’s writing in this article, and several more to come. I hope his passion and enthusiasm for style will speak volumes to you like it did to me. </p>
<p> The British or English Suit </p>
<p> We are now strolling in the street believed to have given birth to the traditional British suit. A street that signifies the British influence in traditional bespoke men’s tailoring. </p>
<p> Built in the 1700s, and named after Lady Dorothy Savile, the street was meant for the high political class and military elite of those times. </p>
<p> As you can easily imagine, the witty British merchants of luxurious goods saw this very street as a golden opportunity. And in no time, literally everything those wealthy officers and politicians might have needed could be found just around the corner of their majestic dwelling in Savile Row. </p>
<p> Obviously, amongst the luxurious goods of the mid 19th century, we find the finest men’s garments provided by the greatest bespoke tailors. One of them changed the course of men’s fashion irremediably. </p>
<p> He was at number 37, Savile Row. The atelier of Henry Poole, father of the otherwise know as British style. </p>
<p> In the second half of the 1800s, Sir Poole, under the commission of the Prince of Wales, created a tailless smoking jacket made out of the same fabric of a tailcoat. The garment is also referred to as the dinner jacket. The vision of the Prince of Wales, together with the creative mind of a skilled tailor, slowly changed what was considered formal wear amongst an extremely traditional high class. </p>
<p> The dinner jacket, and, of course, the whole new suit style they created, had a set of unique characteristics that persisted through time, were passed from generation to generation arriving in our wardrobes under the label “British style”. This is one the greatest examples of timeless style. </p>
<p> But allow me now go into some details of a traditional British suit. I’ll be sharing with you some of the fundamental details that will allow you to recognize a British cut immediately. </p>
<p> We’re looking at a very structured and highly tailored garment. The structure is emphasized by defined shoulders, which also feature thick shoulder pads. The canvas is stiff, thus giving the jacket a very controlled look as opposed to a lighter canvas that would follow the natural curves of the body. </p>
<p> The fit is tailored to be close to the body, with close fitting sleeves ending with the so-called surgeon’s cuffs and a high armhole. The front of the jacket is adorned with a low type of gorge lines and ticket pockets. </p>
<p> The garment comes in heavy cloth, which makes the jacket very functional in the terrific Royal weather. You can also see it single, or double breasted, with usually two vents. </p>
<p> You need to remember that the jacket was meant for a military elite and noble British class of the mid 19th century. And a structured jacket was the standard of formality at the time. </p>
<p> An element that signified the social status of the person (or family) wearing it and that was closely related to the even older and more traditional uniform. Despite all the innovative elements of the jacket (e.g. no tail, single-breasted etc.), Sir Poole kept one traditional element to its design and created a balanced combination of old (and established) and new (and revolutionary). </p>
<p> The Pants </p>
<p> Obviously, abundance was an element that the wealthy class of Savile Row did not fear at all. And if we had to describe the pant of British suit with one word, that word would be indeed abundance. </p>
<p> We’re looking at a garment cut out of a generous amount of fabric. Two elements are really iconic of the suit: high waist and up to 3 pleats, which – if you are not familiar – is a fold created by doubling fabric on itself and securing it in place. </p>
<p> The Italian Suit </p>
<p> The next journey will bring us in an emerging (although still healing after the second world war) 1945 Rome, in the old fashioned Via Barberini. Yet another influential street. </p>
<p> Yet other creative artists who revolutionized Italian fashion and not only. Just like the rise of the British style, the Italian was also a slow and steady road to worldwide success and appreciation. </p>
<p> It was only in 1952 that that idea grew immensely after the first fashion show (properly said) held at Palazzo Pitti in Florence. </p>
<p> Many names are believed to have had a significant role in the design of the Italian suit, as we know it today. Some remarkable mentions are Ermenegildo Zegna, Nazareno Fonticoli (founder of Brioni) and Armani. </p>
<p> Regardless of the particular tailor or designer, there’s one common element that created the Italian suit: Italians. Here we see how the nature of the people itself leads designers to a completely new concept of formal wear. </p>
<p> Italians were not comfortable in the stiff and structured British cut. A garment that is way too rooted in traditions to leave very little room to accommodate more stylish trends. A suit that is too heavy to be worn comfortably in warmer weather. </p>
<p> The Italian suit evolved in many styles over the years. Nowadays, we identify three major styles in Italy, namely Romano, Napoletano and Milanese. But going into the details of these three would be too big of a diversion and the topic is so detailed that would be itself another article! </p>
<p> For now, imagine yourself in the glorious Palazzo Pitti seeing the Italian suit for the first time back in 1952. Those elements, those details, those lines are still the ones you would see now in a modern Italian suit. </p>
<p> The jacket (giacca in Italian– allow me a little Italian lesson here and there) is made keeping one and one thing only in mind: lightness. </p>
<p> The garment, in fact, looks light, feels light, and wears light. It is short and fits tight and close to the body. The canvas is also very light. The jacket is considerably less structured compared to the British one, and as a result of that, the cloth follows one’s natural curves. The shoulders are lightly padded, and the overall padding is significantly reduced. </p>
<p> The front of the jacket shows a pronounced V-shape, tight at the waist. Fun fact: the V-shape is actually deemed very attractive in a man, a detail that could be the hidden secret to our great (almost effortless) success with women! </p>
<p> The jacket comes single-breasted, and also features high gorge lines, flapless pockets and high buttons (usually two or three – although more exotic variations can be also found). </p>
<p> I Pantaloni – The Pants </p>
<p> To accompany the light and stylish jacket, the heavy British pants in abundant fabric had to be completely redesigned! The sleek silhouette set by the jacket is a constant also in the pants, thus giving a smooth look from head to toes. </p>
<p> We’re looking at pants with a tapered waist, which fit really tight to the hips. It ends with one break, in the most traditional design. Nowadays, no-break type of pants is also common in the Italian style. </p>
<p> The American “Sack” Suit </p>
<p> The story behind the American suit is the living proof of how society and the economic situation within a particular country shape fashion. </p>
<p> We’ll be looking back at New York City in the 1920s. The “roaring twenties”. A time of prosperity that had a massive influence on many aspects of our lives now. The first difference can be immediately spotted here: the target group. </p>
<p> We saw in the history of the British suit that the suit was something of a luxurious good meant for the military elite and high political class. Bespoke tailoring was still the only accepted option since the demand was somewhat contained. </p>
<p> In the 1920s, the target group encompassed a wide target group made of the dominant and wealthy business class. Companies, like Brooks Brothers for example – who are considered among the pioneers of the American suit, had to start reinventing the suit in order to make it suitable for mass production. And we see these elements loud and clear just by having a quick attentive look at the American suit. </p>
<p> The American jacket also goes by the name of “the sack”. Now, common practice associates the name to the look of the jacket itself. Which may or may not be the case, depending on whether you had to jacket custom fitted or just picked it off the rack. </p>
<p> “The sack” actually comes from the French “sacque”, which is a particular construction technique for coats and jackets. The jacket, in fact, is made out of only two straight fabric panels. A technique that would be perfect for large scale production of clothes. </p>
<p> The jacket also comes with almost no padding and a straight silhouette. It is usually single breasted, with two or three buttons. The canvas features no darts, which – in case you’re not familiar – are folds in the canvas layer that give it a more voluminous look. </p>
<p> It also has a single vent in the back, low armholes and flap pockets. The sleeves wear with a loose fit and feature three buttons only. </p>
<p> The American Suit: The Pants </p>
<p> As for the jacket, the way pants look is also heavily influenced by the rapid industrial construction technique. The pants are a full cut, with no pleats which would save a significant amount of fabric in the large scale production. </p>
<p> The End of the Journey </p>
<p> Welcome back to the modern times! </p>
<p> Hopefully, by now you have learned what made the history of men’s wear across the world. When choosing the right suit for you, always keep in mind those differences and pick what suits you best. </p>
<p> On average, Italian suits work best with a slim and athletic person. American suits are for a more tough built, and can look great with very little extra work if you want to have it custom fitted. British suits are still the most formal wear, and can be highly tailored to any body type. </p>
<p> And if you feel none of those styles fits you, your idea of style and your personality, then combine them, revolutionize them, turn them inside out, just like those inspiring artist did before you. And maybe sometime in the future, there will be someone like me writing about your style. </p>

<p> Easy Glazed Pork Chops </p>
<p> This easy method for cooking pork chops in a skillet is hands down the best way to cook pork chops. The results are super juicy and tender pork chops with a flavorful glaze that only takes minutes to make. </p>
<p> Thick-Cut Pork Chops </p>
<p> The most important ingredient in this recipe for easy brown sugar glazed pork chops is… you guessed it, the pork chops! So many people complain that they find pork dry and tough, but if you start with the right pork chops, there’s no reason why you can’t make delicious, juicy and tender chops, along with a very simple glaze in about ten minutes. The key to the chops is the thickness. Chops that are at least one-inch thick will take longer to cook through than thin chops, and that time is needed to properly sear the outside of the meat. If you try to make the recipe with thin pork chops, the interior can easily be over-cooked by the time the outside has browned. So… buy good thick cut pork chops! Having said that, if thin chops are all you have (or what you prefer), reduce the cooking time to 4 to 5 minutes once you’ve put the lid on the pan and then remove the chops and proceed with making the glaze. They may not be quite as brown on the outside, but they should still be moist inside. </p>
<p> Four Ingredient Glaze for Pork Chops </p>
<p> One of the reasons this recipe is so very simple is that the ingredient list is really kept to a minimum. Even so, there’s no compromising on flavor. Seasoning and dredging the chops with flour, salt, freshly ground black pepper and smoked paprika adds great flavor to the chops before we even get started. The spice rub not only seasons the chops properly, but also helps to brown them on the outside as well. You could also use brined pork chops for this recipe if you really want to ensure a flavorful and moist result. You can see how to brine the pork chops here. </p>
<p> The glaze is made of just four ingredients: brown sugar, white wine vinegar, Dijon mustard and soy sauce. That’s it! It’s a simple combo of acid and sugar and it works. You’ll need a good whisk to get the Dijon mustard and brown sugar to completely dissolve in the pan. I like to use my favorite flat whisk for this task. </p>

<p> How to Cook Thick Cut Pork Chops </p>
<p> There are a number of ways to cook pork chops. I believe this method is really the easiest and guarantees moist results. Sear the chops in the pan over medium-high heat. Don’t flip the chops too soon. Give them a solid two minutes on each side. That, incidentally, is longer than you think. Count to 120 before you even think about touching them. Then, pop a lid on the pan and lower the heat to medium-low. This turns the sauté pan into an oven of sorts, helping to trap the steam around the pork chops and letting them cook more evenly without losing their moisture. An alternative would be to transfer the pan to a 375ºF oven, but honestly it will take longer to cook in the oven and that just gives the pork more time to potentially dry out. We’re going with easy in this recipe, so a lid and lower heat works like a charm. </p>

<p> Glazed Pork Chops </p>
<p> Once the pork chops have cooked through and register 145ºF on an instant read thermometer, set them aside and loosely tent with foil. Then make the glaze by simply adding the four ingredients mentioned above and whisking to dissolve. It will only take a minute or two for everything to dissolve and come to a boil. Then, return the chops to the pan and turn them over a few times to coat all sides of the chops with the glaze. Another minute to make sure everything is nice and hot and that’s it!! </p>

<p> Air Fryer Pork Chops </p>
<p> Don’t feel like cooking on the stovetop? Yes, you can convert this recipe to your air fryer, although the chops might not get as brown. (Learn more about how to convert recipes to the air fryer here.) Dredge the chops with the seasoned flour and then spritz all sides of the chops with oil. Air-fry at 400ºF for 10 minutes, flipping them over halfway through the cooking time. While the chops are air-frying, combine the glaze ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve the mustard and brown sugar. Brush the glaze on the chops and air-fry for another 2 minutes, flipping the chops and glazing again halfway through. Et voilà – easy air fryer brown sugar glazed pork chops! </p>

<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Pat the pork chops dry with a clean kitchen towel. Combine the flour, smoked paprika, salt and freshly ground black pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge all sides of the pork chops with the seasoned flour. </p>
<p> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a glug or two of olive oil to the pan and sear the pork chops until evenly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Sear the edges of the pork chops as well. </p>
<p> Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan with a lid. Cook the pork chops over low heat for 6 to 10 minutes until they reach an internal temperature of 145°F with an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the chops. (Timing will depend on the thickness of the pork chops.)Transfer the chops to a plate and cover them loosely with aluminum foil. </p>
<p> Turn the heat under the pan up to medium and add the white wine vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar and Dijon mustard. Whisk the ingredients together and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower the heat and return the pork chops to the pan. Coat both sides of the pork chops with the glaze and cook for another minute. Season with freshly ground black pepper. </p>

<p> Made this tonight with thick boneless center cut pork loin chops. Turned out fabulous! I usually have trouble getting a glaze to “glaze” but this worked perfectly. Definitely a “repeater” in my kitchen. Thanks!! </p>
<p> Hey Blue Jean Chef, I don’t like vinegar at all . So my question is, can you taste it or is it real tangy tasting? Could I just leave it out? </p>
<p> With only four ingredients in the glaze, I wouldn’t leave it out. There is a little tang to the chops, but it won’t taste like vinegar. If you like BBQ sauce, you’ll like this glaze. </p>
<p> Made the pork chops tonight and they really are delicious. Also made the potatoes drizzled with a tiny bit of glaze. Yum! Loved them. </p>
<p> This was the best recipe ever for Pork Chops!! Followed your recipe exactly and they came out perfect. Had oven roasted asparagus and roasted garlic/olive oil Couscous. We drizzled the glaze over all and it was amazing!! </p>
<p> Fixed this for dinner this evening. It was very easy to put together and was delicious. I only did two pork chops but didn’t cut the amounts for the dredge or the glaze. I served it with wild rice and a salad. I’ll be making it again. </p>
<p> I made these last night with thick bone-in pork loin chops. So delicious – and easy! The glaze was wonderful! Will definitely make again. I didn’t have an instant read thermometer though and need to get one. Any suggestions on a good one? </p>
<p> We made this last night. It was DELICIOUS!! Only cooked two large chops but had a full batch of glaze. Great. Would recommend highly. Thank you. </p>
<p> I have a picky husband and he LOVED these. I would never have thought of this combination. Very easy to put together. Thanks. </p>

<p> Bruschetta with Pesto </p>
<p> Share </p>
<p> This easy Bruschetta Recipe is made with pesto, fresh tomatoes, olive oil, goat cheese, a sprinkle of arugula and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, making this the perfect anytime appetizer. </p>
<p> Bruschetta with Pesto </p>
<p> There’s nothing like beginning the perfect Italian dinner with a slice or two of bruschetta. This is another Poor Man’s dish that originated in Naples, and then spread through Italy and of course the world. </p>
<p> For Italians it is very simple and easily made. And is always made when barbecuing. You can always hear someone shouting “don’t forget the Bruschetta”, and that someone is usually me! </p>
<p> After you have finished grilling your Meat, Fish and or Veggies the last to be grilled is the bread. You are going to want to eat it nice and warm with your meal. </p>
<p> Old bread never gets thrown out, just make Bruschetta. Even using a small pan grill. </p>
<p> Of course Italians will argue on the best possible bread for grilling. They tend to think a closed crust is better than a crust with a lot of holes. Personally I will take it with either bread. </p>
<p> In fact I used my pan grill today to make this delicious recipe. Which I do quite often when we have leftover bread hanging around. You can even make make it plain with a rub of garlic, a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, </p>
<p> or even chop up some Fresh Tomatoes to add. But if you want something special then this is the recipe for you. </p>
<p> How to make Bruschetta with Pesto </p>
<p> First thing to do is toast the slices of crusty Italian bread that you need (day old is even better). </p>
<p> In a medium bowl mix together the chopped tomatoes, onions, oregano, basil, salt and olive oil. </p>
<p> Spread a little Pesto on top of the bread, you can make your own or use a good store bought. </p>
<p> Top with some tomato mixture, a few leaves of arugula, some flakes of goat cheese and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar if you wish. </p>
<p> I decided to go with the classic Basil Pesto but if you like something a little stronger than an Arugula Pesto would work too. </p>
<p> Of course you are going to want a cheese with a bit of a kick that is why I chose a goat cheese. It’s tangy and has a slightly sour taste. But so good. </p>
<p> How to store Bruschetta </p>
<p> It should not be stored it should be eaten immediately. Although the tomato and onion mixture can be made a day in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator, until ready to use. </p>
<p> One of the most important things to remember is the proper pronunciation, remember in Italian “SCH” is pronounced “SK” as in “ski or skip”. Therefore it’s Brusketta not Brushetta. 🙂 </p>
<p> So if you are looking for a new way to eat one of the most delicious Italian appetizers I hope you give this Bruschetta with Pesto a try. Buon Appetito! </p>
<p> Bruschetta with Pesto </p>
<p> This easy Bruschetta Recipe is made with pesto, fresh tomatoes, olive oil, goat cheese, a sprinkle of arugula and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. </p>
<p> 30 ribbon slices* of goat cheese </p>
<p> balsamic glaze (as much as desired) </p>
<p> *slice the cheese with a potato peeler or cheese grater. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a medium bowl toss together the chopped tomatoes, onion, oregano, chopped basil, salt and olive oil. Set aside. </p>
<p> On medium / hot, Heat pan grill and keep temperature relatively high, place sliced bread on pan and turn until toasted, remove to a large plate and spread with pesto, top with a heaping tablespoon of tomato mixture, some arugula leaves, two or three ribbons of goat cheese and a drizzle of balsamic glaze if desired. Serve immediately. Enjoy! </p>

<doc id="file14874881" filename="carne-asada-mexican-steak-331500" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.thespruceeats.com/carne-asada-mexican-steak-331500">
<p> On its most basic level, carne asada is a marinated and grilled steak, sliced thin and served on tortillas or used as an ingredient in a wide range of dishes. The basic method is to marinate most any kind of beef in a lime-based marinade. Grill it over a hot fire, preferably charcoal, and then slice into thin strips across the grain. But there is a whole lot more to this grilled beef than that. In Mexico and the American Southwest, you will find that carne asada has become the modern Spanish equivalent of barbecue—in the party sense of the word. </p>
<p> Type of Grill </p>
<p> Traditionally, a large charcoal fire pit is used to prepare carne asada. At home, a charcoal grill works best. Since the meat is cooked over direct heat, you won't need a lid. Mesquite chips in a smoker box on your gas grill will help, but nothing beats the authentic flavor of a real fire. </p>
<p> Cut of Beef </p>
<p> The cut of beef you use should be flavorful, but it doesn't need to be tender. Carne asada is usually made from skirt steak. Alternatives include flank steak, sirloin flap meat, or even trimmed brisket cut into 1-inch thick "steaks" and then again into thin strips. If you are planning a big party and want to have plenty for everyone, plan on up to a pound of meat per person. </p>
<p> Marinade </p>
<p> Marinating is not entirely necessary, but it is recommended because it will add flavor and tenderness to your meat. A good marinade for carne asada will have lime juice, garlic, onion, and black pepper. Other fruit juices work great as well—especially papaya, which is a powerful natural tenderizer. You can add hot peppers to the marinade if you want, but be careful you don't overpower the meat and make it too hot to handle. Don't add salt to your marinade. </p>
<p> Seasoning </p>
<p> When you get ready to grill, you will want to have salt on hand. Use a good coarse salt and add a little cumin, powdered garlic, chili powder, and whatever else you like. Shake it together and keep it on hand. </p>
<p> Grilling Carne Asada </p>
<p> The grill should be very hot before you start cooking. Place the meat on the grill. When the juices start to rise on the surface, sprinkle the meat with the salt. When the salt liquefies on the surface, flip the meat over and repeat. This seasons the meat as it cooks. Carne asada is supposed to be on the salty side, but this doesn't mean that you need to add an excessive amount. This salting is also the reason you don't want to use a marinade with salt and is key to what makes carne asada taste so good. </p>
<p> Traditionally, carne asada is grilled to well done. Most people who didn't grow up eating this dish might find that a little hard to swallow, so many cooks prepare it medium instead. Once you have the meat grilled to perfection you will want to take it straight to a carving board. Cut the meat across the grain with a good sharp knife. The pieces should be thin strips. Keep the meat warm in a heavy pot with a lid (you can also cook this dish in a pressure cooker if you wish). You don't need to add heat, but you want to hold in the heat you have. </p>
<p> Serving Carne Asada </p>
<p> Serve with warm tortillas and whatever fixings you prefer. A good carne asada taco would be topped with salsa, chopped red onion, guacamole, salt, and lime wedges. If you have leftovers, make enchiladas the next day. Enjoy your carne asada with your preferred cold beverage. </p>

<p> Service was attentive and waitress was knowledgable. Carpacchio was good as was the steak and the sea bass. Fries were excellent but the gnocchi was not. Gnocchi was bland and texture was not quite right.... </p>
<p> Unique menu; the highest of standards for food and service; fitting value for the quality, service, and overall experience. We'll be back! </p>
<p> Excellent food and service. Only point that was a bit disappointing was there was a large group near our table for 2. Thankfully they left within half an hour. We could not talk to each other for their noise. </p>
<p> Food is so good! Thank you for over delivering !!! So rare that I’m happy with dinners out ! Thank you ! </p>
<p> Once I found out Carne offers the Japanese Wagyu, I had to set up a birthday date there. It's quite fancy and didn't know what to expect. The amount of food we ordered were just right and we still took some home. Wagyu was perfectly cooked and a must try. Service was good but since it was our first time there, perhaps it could have been more inviting with how we ordered in the menu. It was pretty much straightforward but it could help what to accompany it with or what they would suggest to compliment each dish. Overall it was a great experience and food was excellent including the amount received. Thank you! </p>
<p> Our first visit, lovely ambiance, very attentive service, excellent food choices and superb taste quality. Our waiter was helpful and kind. Complimentary parking was an added bonus. We will tell our friends and be back! Thank you </p>
<p> Truly, this restaurant has never disappointed us. My wife and I recommend Carne to our friends under the pretence that it is our favourite restaurant in the city. We’ve dined at Carne for several different special events and will again, as soon as we can! </p>
<p> Top quality all the way. Appears expensive due to meat prices, but it all balances out. Superb service from Owen on our visit. We will return </p>
<p> We had a very good time in Carne. The steak was awesome! We will definitely come back again! </p>
<p> We always enjoy our time at this place, since it was called 295 even, the people are amazing and the food is even more amazing! I always try something new because I know it will be tasty even if it’s something I wouldn’t usually go for. The staff is so kind and attentive! My husband and I will probably continue to go here for years to come! Thanks for everything! </p>
<p> The restaurant was almost empty which on a Sunday night was surprising. The food was very good however somewhat over priced. Service was quite good however had to ask for a finger bowl for the rack of lamb which was a large serving. Wine was good but again overpriced. Parking was easy. Would recommend reducing the size of the servings and the price simultaneously. Range of wines good. </p>
<p> We were visiting Winnipeg from St. Louis, MO and Dallas, TX to see the Blues play the Jets. We had a wonderful dinner and our server, Meredith, was superb! The oysters were fresh and tasty, the Ribollita soup delicious, the tenderloin cooked to perfection and the pastas wonderful. We highly recommend this well located downtown restaurant. </p>
<p> A little music would have been nice but the food was unbeatable! I will definitely be back! </p>
<p> First time here and was very impressed. We tried quite a few dishes, including steak and pasta and everything was delicious. Next time we will splurge for the Wagyu but our Canadian tenderloin was absolutely perfect as well. Service was prompt and non intrusive. </p>
<p> This may have been the best meal I have ever had. The osso bucco was outstanding. </p>
<p> Service was amazing. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. We ordered the bone in rib steak, which was disappointing for the price range. It was cooked perfectly to a medium rare as per our order. We found it to be tough and chewy unfortunately. The manager suggested we try the Alberta waygu steak which turned out to be phenomenal. Again, cooked perfectly, full of flavour and could cut through it with your fork. Well worth it! The tempura cauliflower was delicious as well as the brussel sprouts (too much glaze for my personal liking but great flavour). Overall, I really enjoyed the food, service and the ambience of the place. Great staff! I’ll definitely return again....with a larger group so I can taste more dishes!🙂 </p>
<p> Always the best dining experience when Dale serves our family!!! Great food, great service! </p>
<p> The food was superb our server Allen was fantastic very knowledgeable, helpful and very professional! I would ask to have him as our waiter whenever we visit again !! </p>
<p> Food was great as usual. Had two young children with us, not made to feel rushed or like they were not welcome, which we appreciated. Excellent service! </p>
<p> For a fine dinning restaurant that specializes in steaks, I found my very pricy Wagu steak less than impressive. It was seasoned and cooked well but not very tender. It was closer to a AA grade of beef. </p>
<p> First time here, was impressed with the food and quality of food and service, I recommended to my friends and would return again </p>
<p> Our server was amazing. She was well versed on the menu and provided excellent recommendations. </p>
<p> Our A5 Wagyu was not as we have had in the past. This piece of steak had tough piece of sinew throughout the one side. It was taken care of however not what’s expected when ordering a $90 steak. </p>
<p> We were place at a table that seemed to have been place in the middle of a room by a doorway just past the mail dining area. There was a lot of traffic of servers and guests due to table placement. </p>
<p> Overall our visit was very good excluding the issue with the Wagyu steak and table placement. </p>
<p> Great menu, extremely well prepared food. Highly recommend the rack of lamb and the octopus salad. </p>
<p> My guest has a gluten allergy and Owen the waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful; the choices and the kitchen were accommodating to modifying things. </p>
<p> This was one of the best meals at a higher end restaurant that I can remember ever having! Usually when I’m paying a lot of a dinner I am left feeling like it wasn’t worth it or unsatisfied but everything was so good, each item has its own unique bold flavour and the service was super good. It was me and my significant other on New Years Eve and we ordered the 16 oz New York steak (they cut it up nicely for us to share), the add on order of scallops (comes with 4), the sides are large and shareable and we got button mushrooms, heirloom carrots and gnocchi with cream sauce. I didn’t find anything on the desert menu particularly intriguing as I don’t eat chocolate but I’m just if you weren’t adverse to it you’d find something. We took our last drinks to the bar after and enjoyed watching the rest of the Jets game on the bar TVs. </p>
<p> We attended dinner early on New Year's Eve. It was extremely busy, but we were seated and attended to very quickly. We received drinks and appetizers very quickly, from our waiter Paul and others. THEN WE SAT....For over 1 hour with excuses about line issues in the kitchen. Finally we received our food, which was more than excellent. One of the mangers approached and even though we said it was not necessary, they covered the total cost of $270.00... As an ex President and CEO, I believe their people covered the problem exceptionally well, with no hesitation or excuses, just an explanation. Will continue to enjoy eating there. </p>
<p> I can’t remember our servers name but me and my partner dine often at carne. We usually have Alan by chance usually when we go and he’s awesome! But everything was so smooth, from the service to the food times! Food and drinks were amazing as always! thumbs up to the staff and kitchen for making a great NYE dinner for me and my partner !! </p>

<p> Ireland Tradition: A Cast Iron Irish Apple Cake </p>
<p> Irish Apple Cake is a traditional dessert in Ireland. Recipes for the moist and tender cast iron cake are as varied as the beautiful people who live in the Emerald Isle. This heritage recipe is a simple and tasty dessert everyone will love. </p>
<p> Like little pots of gold, heritage recipes are treasures like no others. The Irish are known for their simple yet incredibly delicious recipes that have, for generations, passed from mother to daughter in farmhouses all over that beautiful country. </p>
<p> Originally, Irish apple cakes were steamed in pots beside an open fire. And largely made from crab apples, of which are in abundant supply in Ireland. So plentiful, in fact, The Irish Times say the “Irish spend €100 million annually on apples.” </p>
<p> Today, apple cakes are baked in ovens all across the lush, green Irish countryside. </p>
<p> I like to bake this sweet and delicious authentic Irish Apple Cake in a cast-iron skillet. It’s a better conductor of heat, giving the edges that crispy texture we love. Plus, I love to serve warm wedges right from the skillet. Somehow, it just seems to add an additional layer of flavor and coziness. </p>
<p> Apples, especially crab apples, play a significant role in Irish and Celtic mythology. The legendary Avalon, the location where King Arthur was taken to recover from his wounds after fighting Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, is considered a sacred Isle of the apple trees. </p>
<p> Ireland Tradition: A Cast Iron Irish Apple Cake </p>
<p> Irish Apple Cake is a traditional dessert in Ireland. Recipes for the moist and tender cast iron cake are as varied as the beautiful people who live in the Emerald Isle. This heritage recipe is a simple and tasty dessert everyone will love. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line a 10-inch cast iron skillet with parchment paper. Set aside. </p>
<p> In a medium-size bowl, Add the flour and baking powder. Cut in 1 stick, 8 tablespoons of butter, into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Whisk sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the flour and butter mixture. </p>
<p> Make a well in the center of the bowl and add the beaten egg, milk, and vanilla. Mix until a soft dough forms. Almost scone-like. </p>
<p> Spoon and press dough into the bottom of the parchment-lined skillet. Layer thinly sliced apples over the dough. Combine 1 tablespoon of sugar and a dash each of ground cloves and cinnamon. Sprinkle over the apples. </p>
<p> Place the skillet on the middle rack of your oven. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Then, switch the oven to broil. Keep the apple cake in the oven and broil, on the middle rack, 2-3 minutes or until the edges of the cake are golden brown. This step is optional… but I love the added crispness. </p>
<p> Allow the cake to cool slightly, cut into wedges and dust with powdered sugar. Or serve with whipped cream — or ice cream — all of which makes a delightfully delicious topping to this Irish Apple Cake! </p>

<p> I’m making this cake right now and noticed the 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon & 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg are not mentioned in the directions as to when to add them, I do see the dash of cinnamon and cloves to sprinkle of the apples, but that’s it. I’m adding to flour/sugar mixture and thinking I can’t go too far wrong. </p>
<p> I’m making this right now too :). I’ll clarify the directions — thanks for catching that. You DO add the cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture. Enjoy! </p>
<p> this cake sounds so yummy….I Have a set of cast iron pans I use all the time. Can I use cooking spray instead of parchment paper? </p>
<p> Hi Cynthia! Yes you can – I like to use parchment for easy clean up and easy removal of the cake from the pan. But cooking spray should work just fine too! </p>
<p> Made this for dinner guests, everyone loved it. I even posted a picture of my end result on Facebook and now getting requests for the recipe. Thanks for this recipe, I am certain it will become part of my traditional annual St Patrick’s Day dinner from now on, but I won’t wait another year to make this again. </p>
<p> Thank you so much Sandy! Would love to see your photo and so glad you enjoyed it! We love it too ? </p>
<p> Would the texture be changed if I add two sliced apples instead of one? Thank you-cannot wait to make this! </p>
<p> Hi Brenda! Adding an extra apple shouldn’t affect the texture. I’ve not tried two apples before but I do use an extra large apple, which may be the size of two regular ones. It’s so easy — and delicious! Thanks for your question. </p>
<p> Hi, how do I store the left over cake, and do u remove it from the cast iron skillet before it after serving? </p>
<p> Hi Jan! I do remove it from the cast iron skillet for storing. It can be wrapped up and stored on the counter for about a day. Any longer and I’ll refrigerate or freeze. </p>
<p> Can I double this recipe and put it in a larger cast iron skillet? If so how would the cook time change? Thank you!! </p>
<p> Hi Nikki – yes, you can double the recipe. Bake it for the same amount of time. It won’t be done yet but begin checking it in 5 minute increments until a cake tester comes out clean. The baking time will not double. </p>
<p> Smells great- was an easy recipe. Texture is more like a tart than a cake. Hope it tastes good!!!! </p>
<p> Hi Kay! It is such an easy recipe and one a dear Irish woman game me from her family. I’m so in love with their comfort food! </p>
<p> A simple but traditional cake! You’ve inspired me — I’m going to join you and make it this weekend too 😍😍. </p>
<p> This is delicious! I sliced a barely ripe pear on top instead of the apple and it worked out perfectly. A plum would be fun to try too. </p>
<p> Hi Marianna! What a great idea – that’s on my baking list this week! I have made it with a plum — and it’s really good too! Thanks for sharing!! </p>
<p> Sounds delicious and easy too. What size skillet and how many does this recipe serve? </p>
<p> It’s a super easy, simple, authentically Irish cake. I make it in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, but have also made it in a 9-inch cake pan. Watch the baking time when switching between a skillet and a cake pan. The cake should make about 8 wedges. Enjoy! </p>

<p> Cast Iron Skillet Pork Chops </p>
<p> Cast Iron Skillet Pork Chops are a quick and delicious way to serve a satisfying gourmet meal. The meat is coated with a garlic herb mixture before cooking and a hot pan creates a gorgeous sear. </p>
<p> This easy skillet pork chop recipe is your new go-to fancy weeknight supper. Thick-cut pieces of bone-in pork are first marinated with olive oil, fresh herbs, and garlic to infuse more flavor into each bite. It cooks in just 10 minutes for a fast and flavorful main dish. </p>
<p> Cast Iron Skillet Pork Chops </p>
<p> Center cut bone-in pork chops are lean and tender, with a very mild flavor. This makes them perfect for adding a simple herb marinade right before cooking. </p>
<p> The fragrant natural oils in the thyme and pungent garlic flavor infuse into the olive oil so the pork cooks with a bouquet of aromas that transfers to the meat. The actual cooking time is less than 15 minutes, so you can quickly start to feast! </p>
<p> What is the best pork to use? </p>
<p> Shop for frenched, bone-in center-cut pork chops that are 1 to 1 ½-inches thick. The cooking time will vary depending on the size of the chop. The bone provides extra flavor to the meat and prevents the protein from cooking too fast and drying out. The marinade and the thick-cut give the juiciest pork chops you’ll ever taste! </p>
<p> How do you make Cast Iron Skillet Pork Chops? </p>
<p> Combine garlic, olive oil, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper in a bowl. </p>
<p> Coat the pork chops with the herb marinade, 30 to 60 minutes. </p>
<p> Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, then add oil. </p>
<p> Add pork chops and sear 1 minute per side, to create a golden crust. </p>
<p> Reduce heat to medium, cook the pork, flipping every minute until it reaches 135ºF. </p>
<p> Turn off heat, add the thyme and butter. </p>
<p> Baste the pork with melted butter. </p>
<p> Rest the pork for 5 minutes before slicing. </p>
<p> The herb marinade </p>
<p> A simple and fast marinade can be made with just a handful of ingredients. I like to combine roughly chopped garlic, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper. That’s it. I find that not skipping this step makes lean proteins so much more flavorful, like for my chicken marinade. </p>
<p> The pork gets a generous coating of the paste before cooking. Marinating the pork also benefits the taste, by adding more salty notes down into the meat, plus keeps it juicy. </p>
<p> Cooking the pork chops </p>
<p> After a brief 30 to 60-minute marination, the pork is ready to pan-fry. A cast-iron pan is my equipment of choice. It retains heat really well, which transfers straight to the surface of the pork to develop a beautiful golden sear. </p>
<p> The pork in flipped several times for even cooking, and to keep it moist and tender. A butter bastes right at the end adds a lovely richness to the dish. Make sure to rest the pork before slicing to retain those flavorful juices! </p>

<p> Yum!!!! Turns out I do like pork chops! Prior to this meal, the 3 words I associated with pork chops were dry and very dry but this recipe has changed all that. I had pork chops in the fridge and needed a quick right-now recipe. A simple google search yielded this page and I took a chance, now my world is forever changed. Thank you! </p>

<doc id="file14874884" filename="celebrating-chinese-birthdays-687448" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.thoughtco.com/celebrating-chinese-birthdays-687448">
<p> Lauren Mack is a journalist who covers Chinese culture and history. She studied Mandarin Chinese in Beijing and Taipei and has written for Newsweek International, Elle Girl, and the Chicago Tribune. </p>
<p> While Westerners tend to make a big deal of birthdays, celebrating each year of a person's life with parties, cake, and gifts, the Chinese traditionally reserve birthday bashes for infants and the elderly. While they acknowledge most passing years, they don't consider most birthdays worthy of festivities. Globalization has made Western-style birthday parties more common in China, but customary Chinese birthday celebrations adhere to special traditions and certain taboos. </p>
<p> Counting Ages </p>
<p> In the West, a child turns one on the first anniversary of his or her birth. In Chinese culture, however, newborn babies are already considered to be one year old. A Chinese child's first birthday party takes place when he or she turns two. Parents may surround a child with symbolic items in an attempt to predict the future. A baby who reaches for money could come into great wealth as an adult, while a child who grabs a toy airplane may be destined to travel. </p>
<p> You can politely inquire about an older person’s age by asking for their Chinese zodiac sign. The 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac correspond to certain years, so knowing a person’s sign makes it possible to figure out their age. The auspicious numbers of 60 and 80 mean those years warrant full-scale celebration with a gathering of family and friends around a loaded banquet table. Many Chinese people wait until they reach 60 to celebrate their first birthday. </p>
<p> Taboos </p>
<p> Chinese birthdays must be celebrated before or on the actual birth date. Belatedly celebrating a birthday is considered taboo. </p>
<p> Depending on a person's gender, certain birthdays pass without acknowledgment or require special handling. Women, for example, do not celebrate turning 30 or 33 or 66. The age of 30 is considered a year of uncertainty and danger, so to avoid bad luck, Chinese women simply remain 29 for an extra year. On what would be their 33rd birthday, Chinese women actively counteract bad luck by buying a piece of meat, hiding behind the kitchen door, and chopping the meat 33 times to cast all evil spirits into it before throwing the meat away. At the age of 66, a Chinese woman depends on her daughter or closest female relative to chop a piece of meat for her 66 times to ward off trouble. </p>
<p> Chinese men similarly skip their 40th birthday, dodging the bad luck of this uncertain year by remaining 39 until their 41st birthday. </p>
<p> Celebrations </p>
<p> More and more Western-style birthday cakes are making their way into Chinese birthday celebrations, but the birthday girl or boy traditionally slurps longevity noodles, which symbolize long life. An unbroken longevity noodle should fill an entire bowl and be eaten in one continuous strand. Family members and close friends who cannot attend the party often eat long noodles in honor of the birthday to bring longevity to the person celebrating. A birthday banquet may also include hard-boiled eggs dyed red to symbolize happiness and dumplings for good fortune. </p>

<p> Coronavirus </p>
<p> 11 celebrity chefs share their tips for cooking during the coronavirus pandemic </p>
<p> As the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow, celebrity chefs are taking to their social media accounts to share their quarantine-friendly cooking tips and advice for food lovers. </p>
<p> However, chefs like Rachael Ray, Ina Garten, and Antoni Porowski are sharing their tips on how to make the most of what's still on shelves or in your very own pantry. </p>
<p> As the number of coronavirus cases worldwide continues to grow, celebrity chefs like Rachael Ray, Ina Garten, Gordon Ramsay, and Antoni Porowski are taking to Instagram and Twitter to share their tips on stocking up and cooking quarantine-friendly foods. </p>
<p> Here are cooking tips from celebrated TV chefs that will help you during the novel coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p> Rachael Ray is telling her fans to rely more than ever on their pantry staples. </p>
<p> "I know the grocery shelves look bare and your pantry scares you right now, but here's what it is: we're all gonna spend more time at home. Time to focus on who and what we love. Cook with a little more love, lean a little more heavily on your pantry," Ray tweeted. </p>
<p> Ray also included a link to an article from Rachael Ray Magazine listing 15 recipes you can make with pantry staples, including spinach-pea soup and tuna puttanesca penne pasta. </p>
<p> Ray also advocated donating to organizations like Feeding America on her Instagram, pointing out that the school lunch program is the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative in the country after SNAP and food stamps. </p>
<p> Ina Garten reminded her followers to not allow the coronavirus outbreak to stop them from celebrating traditions — and shared some freezer tips. </p>
<p> "In the middle of a crisis, celebrating traditions and staying connected give us a sense of much-needed normalcy," she wrote on Instagram. "Have lunch with a friend over FaceTime or bake something! For St. Patrick's Day, I made Irish Scones with jam and cream — with ingredients I had in my fridge and pantry! If you don't have currants, you can substitute the same amount of raisins, dried cranberries, chopped pecans — or anything delicious that you have!" </p>
<p> "I know so many of you are very anxious about what's to come because I am too. The one thing we can do, though, is cook for the people we love who are sheltered in place with us," she wrote. "Over the next days and weeks, I'll post lots of ideas for delicious things to make from your pantry and fridge — along with substitutions if you only have granulated sugar and not brown sugar, or onions and not shallots! Please stay safe and we will take care of each other through this crisis." </p>
<p> A week later, Ina Garten also shared on Instagram her tips for making use of your freezer, from allowing food to cool to room temperature before packing it into containers to defrosting food in the fridge overnight rather than on the counter. </p>
<p> Antoni Porowski is sharing recipes to make while quarantined, in a series on Instagram he's calling "Quar Eye." </p>
<p> "An omelette made in isolation is still an omelette," Porowski wrote on Instagram. "Served with a black bean salsa made with whatever was left at the grocery store." </p>
<p> In the video posted to Instagram, Porowski makes his "Keep Calm-lette," a vegetarian dish, in under eight minutes. </p>
<p> "We're stuck at home, but we might as well still be able to prepare good food, that's good for us, and that makes us feel good. We need things that make us feel good, even in pandemics like these," he said. </p>
<p> Porowski has since made multiple different pantry-friendly recipes, as well as given his tips for ordering takeout food safely and supporting local businesses. </p>
<p> Food Network star Amanda Freitag also shared her tips for spicing up chicken and other proteins. </p>
<p> "Learning to properly sear food is essential to lock in flavors and make even the most basic ingredients delicious, so if you're quarantined and getting sick of plain chicken, I promise this will help change the game," the chef captioned an Instagram post explaining the technique. </p>
<p> Freitag recommends seasoning your chicken before pan-frying it skin down in some oil. Then, simply pop it in the oven. Freitag also says not to move or shake the chicken until it's done cooking in order to achieve a perfect sear. </p>
<p> Chef Marc Murphy recently took on Food Network's "Chopped Challenge" to show how to turn pantry basics into a delicious dish. </p>
<p> His ingredients included Cheetos, pickles, harissa, and squab, which is a type of bird slightly smaller than a chicken. </p>
<p> Gordon Ramsay shared an easy recipe for marinara sauce for those staying at home. </p>
<p> The recipe calls for canned peeled San Marzano tomatoes, a yellow onion, garlic, basil, tomato paste, red wine, olive oil, salt, and pepper. </p>
<p> "Who knows, it may earn you a @michelinguide?" Ramsay captioned the post on Instagram. </p>
<p> Giada De Laurentiis also shared some quarantine-friendly cooking tips, like how to use pasta leftovers in a new way. </p>
<p> To make what De Laurentiis describes as "pizza cake," add an egg and extra Parmesan cheese to pasta leftovers, pack it into a pan on the stove with some olive oil, fry for a few minutes, flip it, and continue cooking until both sides form a crust. </p>
<p> Chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio took to Twitter to share a food-freezing tip with his followers. </p>
<p> "Ok, if you are not used to cooking for yourself and have questions ask away," he wrote. "For instance, I would cook vegetables now and freeze them for future use." </p>
<p> Michael Symon recommended buying fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables, among other pantry items. </p>
<p> Symon answered fan questions on Twitter about what foods people should buy and recommended buying any meats available as well as fresh, frozen, and canned vegetables. </p>
<p> The chef and television personality also tweeted a list of pantry staples that includes items like pasta, potatoes, whole grain bread, bacon, and eggs. </p>
<p> TV chef and host Alton Brown also listed his simple necessities to stock up on during the coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p> "Dry beans, grains, canned tomatoes, maybe some eggs. Oh, dry pasta and capers, tinned fish...gin. We can get through this," he tweeted. </p>
<p> Brown has also started posting videos to his YouTube channel in two series' he calls "Pantry Raid" and "Quarantine Quitchen." </p>
<p> Padma Lakshmi, host of "Top Chef," recommended relying on your freezer and buying dry goods. </p>
<p> "I know it's a scary time. What I would say is buy frozen vegetables if you can. They sometimes have as much nutrition as fresh vegetables... Make a lot of food... and freeze it in portions — a lot of stews. Dry goods like beans, lentils, quinoa, orzo, all those shelf-stable products are really good because it doesn't cost as much as buying steak or something like that, and it gives you protein and can last for a really long time," Lakshmi said in a Twitter video. </p>
<p> Lakshmi also recommended buying canned tomatoes and tuna. Above all, she reminded people to remain calm and avoid hoarding products like toilet paper. </p>
<p> Lakshmi has since shared some recipes that only require a few ingredients, as well as cooking videos with her kids. </p>

<p> Chef John's 10 Best Steak Recipes </p>
<p> Chef John's been around the butcher's block. The man can cook a steak. He knows his flank from his flap, his strip from his skirt, and the best way to cook each cut. Yes, Chef John has created a ton of top-rated steak recipes. And these are just some of our very favorite recipes. You'll love the simple preparations that bring out the best flavor in each beautiful cut of beef. Now you really can make great steaks at home. Find more steak recipes (and much more) in our complete collection of Chef John's Recipes. </p>
<p> The Best Steak Recipes </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Hanger. With this recipe, you can enjoy restaurant-quality Steak Frites at the homestead. You'll love this inexpensive cut; it turns out as tender as filet mignon and as flavorful as ribeye. "Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, broiled, or grilled," says Chef John. "It takes to marinades wonderfully, and really can be substituted for any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time to trim it well." And for the frites part of the equation, check out Chef John's French Fries. </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Flap. This cut of beef looks like skirt steak, but it's actually cheaper (usually) and equally delicious. "It did make for some extremely tasty Asian-style lettuce wraps," says Chef John. "You can use flap meat in so many other wonderful ways. You should try this in tacos or Philly cheese steak. I used the grilled meat with lettuce, carrots, red onions, chopped peanuts, and cilantro leaves to make a salad. For the dressing I combined the reserved meat juices, sambal, fish sauce, and rice vinegar to taste. I didn't measure anything, and neither should you." </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Skirt. "This Cuban-inspired mojo marinade would work great as an all-purpose marinade for just about anything destined for the grill, but skirt steak is my top choice," says Chef John. Enjoy on nachos or in quesadillas, tacos, or low-carb lettuce wraps. </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Tenderloin. You can use almost any cut of steak. They get a quick high-heat searing, then it's all about the sauce. "There are hundreds of ways to make pizzaiola, from versions featuring slowly braised tough cuts of beef to quickly seared tenderloin medallions, like I used here," says Chef John. "The one thing most people agree on is that you should, if at all possible, use really fresh, very sweet, vine-ripened tomatoes. Serve on top of toasted bread with mozzarella cheese." </p>
<p> Cut of steak: New York strip. This grilled steak gets a double-shot of garlic and a blast of balsamic vinegar at the end to balance everything out. "If you are a fan of garlic, this garlic steak with garlic confit will surely put a smile on your face," says Chef John. </p>
<p> Cut of steak: boneless top round. "If you've ever wanted to channel your inner barbarian and cook a large hunk of meat right on the coals, no grill, then this the recipe for you," says Chef John. "The flavor of this beef lands somewhere between grilled and smoked, and I've got a great garlicky, acidic pepper sauce to go with it. Try this recipe with a more expensive cut of meat plus any sauce of choice, from chimichurri to barbeque. You can't go wrong!" </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Flank steak. The key here is a simple marinade featuring classic Tuscan ingredients like olive oil and fresh rosemary, blended up with fresh lemon juice, garlic, and red pepper flakes. "I've only been to Tuscany once, but I do remember a grilled steak coming off a charcoal fire, which was then sliced and splashed with olive oil, lemon, and rosemary," says Chef John. "While I'm sure my version is far from traditional, it's really tasty and the very user-friendly flank steak is the perfect cut." </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Flank. Chef John recommends that you use beef flank steak if possible, as it produces the most stylish shreds. "This Cuban braised beef dish literally translates to 'old clothes,' because apparently some people thought the fall-apart meat and colorful strips of onions and peppers, tangled together, looked like old, tattered clothing," says Chef John. "You'll love this dish if you're into big, bold flavors, since there's nothing subtle about the seasoning here. Delicious served with beans, rice, and plantain chips. Garnish with more cilantro." </p>
<p> Cut of steak: Flank. Beer is the key ingredient of an amazing barbeque sauce for grilled flank steak. It's actually sauce, marinade, and basting liquid all in one. "There are very few things in life as beautiful as a glistening, smoky flank steak on a grill, being painted with beerbecue sauce," says Chef John. "Any beer will do, but try to use something on the more aggressive side if you can. The subtle bitterness from the beer in the background really makes this sauce pop." </p>
<p> Cut of steak: New York strip. "This simple technique not only provides you with a NY strip steak that eats like a filet mignon, but the trimmings are used to make a world-class pan sauce," says Chef John. "Even if a faux-bordelaise isn't your cup of tea, you can always save the scraps for a Sunday sauce or meatballs. The overnight 'dry-aging' step is optional, but does add a little something extra to the final product." </p>

<p> Chef John's French Fries </p>
<p> "I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be twice fried. The first frying in done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Soak potatoes in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. </p>
<p> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add the potatoes in the hot oil for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Remove potatoes from oil with a slotted spoon to drain on paper towel and to cool completely. </p>
<p> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry the potatoes again until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve. </p>

<p> Editor's Note: </p>
<p> We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount will vary depending on cooking time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used. </p>

<p> These were perfectly crispy and delicious! ! I did season them with garlic salt and cracked black pepper ..... My 3 year old and husband gobbled them up :) </p>

<p> Quick, easy and delicious. Try par-boiling and chilling before the first fry to make them really fluffy on the inside. </p>
<p> Darling husband bought a french fry cutter at the flea market and was dying to make his own hand cut fries. This recipe was a great guideline for making crispy fries. Thanks! </p>

<p> Chef John's Italian Meatballs </p>
<p> Homemade meatballs are a very easy to make, and since we skip the very messy step of pan-frying these before they hit the sauce, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. You can substitute water or beef broth for the milk, if preferred. </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in hot oil until translucent, about 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Mix beef and pork together in a large bowl. Stir onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, Italian herb seasoning, and Parmesan cheese into meat mixture with a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour. </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </p>
<p> Step 6 </p>
<p> Using wet hands, form meat mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Arrange onto prepared baking sheet. </p>
<p> Step 7 </p>
<p> Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. </p>
<p> I Made It Print </p>
<p> Cook's Notes: </p>
<p> Some recipes use equal portions of beef, veal, and pork, which is also nice, yet more expensive. These days you can find all sorts of lean-to-fat ratios for ground beef. Most stores sell 90% lean, 10% fat, but I prefer the 80% lean, 20% fat ratio for this recipe. </p>
<p> Once cooked, you can add the meatballs to your favorite prepared tomato sauce for 1 to 2 hours. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> Parchment can be used for easier cleanup/removal from the pan. </p>
<p> Partner Tip </p>
<p> Reynolds® Aluminum foil can be used to keep food moist, cook it evenly, and make clean-up easier. </p>

<p> I made Chef John's meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family. Read More </p>

<p> I just took these out of the oven and they were swimming in liquid!! They weren't browned or even close - the flavor of the meat is good but the consistency of the cooked meatballs is wrong - won't make again! Read More </p>

<p> These meatballs were awesome! I added more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, left out the red pepper, and used beef broth instead of milk. They were a big hit and I even posted a picture! Thanks Chef John! Read More </p>
<p> CJ's Italian Meatballs Haiku: "I can't believe it. These beat 'Meatball Nirvana' And they held up too!" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn't have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn't fall apart! So I don't know what of CJ's method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR's 'Meatball Nirvana' in our house from now on.

<p> Excellent meatballs! They are perfectly seasoned! I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the sautéed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so – everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn’t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I’ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don’t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use. Read More </p>
<p> These meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe as is. No problems with it whatsoever. Thanks Chef John!

<p> These are FANTASTIC meatballs! I used meatloaf mix, b/c it was cheaper (believe it or not) than buying the beef and pork seperately. I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain and dried parsley in place of the fresh. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and would not change a thing next time. I was scared b/c the mixture was so soft (even after refrigeration), but I proceeded on, and I am so glad I didn't add extra breadcrumbs like I wanted to...these held their shape and were so moist, tender, flavorful and delicious...one of the best I've made/eaten! I used my large cookie scoop and got 26 out of this recipe. My family RAVED over these...even my 10 month old twins couldn't get enough, lol. Seriously, these are sooooo good! I will def be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :) Read More </p>
<p> I just took these out of the oven and they were swimming in liquid!! They weren't browned or even close - the flavor of the meat is good but the consistency of the cooked meatballs is wrong - won't make again! Read More </p>
<p> These tasted really good and were super easy to make. Just a couple of things: I think next time I'll use maybe a 1/3 cup of milk as they were almost too juicy to form into balls. Also, next time I will try baking them with a rack in the pan as they really did make a lot of grease and I think they would taste better without sitting in it. Third, I wish they would have browned up a little better. I even kept them in the oven for a few more mintutes at 450 and that didn't help. But, again, the best tasting meatballs I've ever made. Nothing wrong with the recipe as written, just personal preference, a five star recipe for sure! Read More </p>
<p> Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn't disappointed. These meatballs were intended for sub sandwiches with marinara, but after tasting them fresh out of the oven, I felt like I was doing an injustice to this fine specimen of meat by slopping marinara over it. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using this for years. Read More </p>

<p> Reviews for: Photos of Chef John's Italian Meatballs </p>
<p> I made Chef John's meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family. </p>

<p> These meatballs were awesome! I added more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, left out the red pepper, and used beef broth instead of milk. They were a big hit and I even posted a picture! Thanks Chef John! </p>
<p> CJ's Italian Meatballs Haiku: "I can't believe it. These beat 'Meatball Nirvana' And they held up too!" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn't have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn't fall apart! So I don't know what of CJ's method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR's 'Meatball Nirvana' in our house from now on. </p>
<p> Excellent meatballs! They are perfectly seasoned! I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the sautéed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so – everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn’t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I’ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don’t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use. </p>
<p> These meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe as is. No problems with it whatsoever. Thanks Chef John!

<p> Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib </p>
<p> "This is a specific formula for achieving a perfectly pink prime rib cooked somewhere a shade under medium rare. To use this method you must have a full-sized, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Place rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, about 4 hours. </p>
<p> Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). </p>
<p> Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt. </p>
<p> Roast the 4-pound prime rib (see footnote if using a larger and smaller roast) in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours. Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve. </p>
<p> Footnotes </p>
<p> Cook's Note: </p>
<p> Your cooking times will vary depending on the size of your prime rib roast. To calculate your cooking time, multiply the exact weight of the roast by 5. Round the resulting number to the nearest whole number. The rib is cooked at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. For example, for a 6 pound roast: 6x5=30, so cooking time is 30 minutes. Turn the oven off and wait 2 hours before opening the oven door. Remove the prime rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. </p>

<p> Chef John's Smothered Pork Chops </p>
<p> "You know that when a recipe has 'smothered' in the name, it's going to be easy. It's a beautiful combination of dark, rich onion gravy covering pan-fried pork chops. Serve over hot cooked rice." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Sprinkle pork chops with poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper on both sides. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; brown pork chops well on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate. </p>
<p> Discard excess grease from pan and melt butter in the same skillet. Reduce heat to medium and stir onion in the hot skillet with a pinch of salt until onion is very browned and caramelized, about 15 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute; stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes. </p>
<p> Pour chicken broth into skillet and stir, dissolving browned bits of food in the bottom of the skillet. Pour juices that have accumulated on plate containing pork chops into the sauce. Mix in buttermilk until smooth. Add water. Bring sauce to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook until onions begin to break down and sauce is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Place pork chops into sauce, spooning sauce over meat to coat. Turn heat to low and simmer until chops are tender and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Adjust levels of salt and pepper and serve chops with gravy on top. </p>

<p> He Chef's Knife </p>
<p> What is a Chef's Knife and What is it Used For? </p>
<p> A chef’s knife is the most common type of knife which you will find in any modern kitchen around the world. It is truly a multi-purpose knife which can be used in many different ways – cutting, slicing, dicing, crushing, chopping and mincing. All these techniques are possible to handle and master with a chef’s knife because of its specific size and design. </p>
<p> It is one of the larger kitchen knives. Normally it has rather larger blade measuring from 7 to 8 inches in length, a slightly curved cutting edge and a pointy tip. The blade is rather ample, usually around 1.5 inches wide, or even wider. Although, you can also find shorter or longer blades – all the way from 6 inches (exceptionally short) to even 12 inches (really large), these dimensions are not very common. </p>
<p> Unlike the various types of special-purpose knives, the chef’s knife is designed in a way it can get in touch with vast variety of different ingredients and easily disassemble them in various ways. </p>
<p> The broad and rather thick blade is not only particularly strong in the cutting process but also ensures that the knife can be guided comfortably and safely close to the knuckles. </p>
<p> This way, you can break even the finest herbs into tiny pieces or dissect meat into gossamer tenderloins. </p>
<p> The slightly curved blade of this knife is perfectly designed for slicing. A somewhat rounded edge allows you to divide your ingredients in a single, fluid motion. </p>
<p> Cooking chef’s knives are available in different price ranges. Cheaper ones are usually made of stamped steel, and the more expensive ones are made from forged steel. </p>
<p> Upper range handmade chef’s knives can reach prices even up to $5.000, while you can get cheap stamped knives in just about any store for even as low as $20. </p>
<p> Of course, there is a big difference in quality between these price ranges. </p>
<p> The significant advantage of Damascus steel chef’s knives is that they are available at reasonable prices. </p>
<p> German vs French Type of Blade </p>
<p> There are many dimensions, materials, and grip designs of modern chef’s knives. However, small differences in the shape of the blades make them fall either under the category of French or German type of blade. </p>
<p> What makes the main difference is the shape of the blade: </p>
<p> a German-style knife has an evenly curved blade from the heel to the tip of the blade, </p>
<p> while French-style knives have a more straight edge and curve up only at the tip. </p>
<p> Both types are referred to as Western types of chef’s knives. </p>
<p> The design of the grip is not crucial for defining either of the two types. The style can var. However, both German and French chef’s knives are full-tang knives with riveted grips commonly made from wood, micarta or G-10 material. </p>
<p> A Japanese parallel is a well-known Santoku knife, which is an Eastern type of a Chef’s knife. </p>
<p> Santoku Knife - An Eastern Equivalent to a Western Chef's Knife </p>
<p> In Japan and Asia, a counterpart to the western chef knife is the Santoku. While it is technically not exactly the same as an (Western) Chef’s knife, it has very similar design and cutting properties. It also has a broad range of functions and uses when it comes to processing the cooking ingredients. </p>
<p> The main difference between a Santoku and western versions of chef knives is the shape of the blade. </p>
<p> While still being slightly curved, the blade of Santoku is more straightforward when compared to German or French chef knives. Also, the spine of the blade of the Santoku is curved down at the tip of the blade. </p>
<p> A traditional Santoku has a ‘half-tang’ handle with wooden octagonal grip. </p>
<p> However, modern Santoku knives come with various handle designs and grips made from wood or contemporary artificial materials (Micarta, G-10, …). </p>
<p> A Santoku knife tends to be a bit smaller, thinner, and lighter when compared to a western chef’s knife. </p>
<p> Many modern models also have small ‘pockets’ at the cutting edge (Granton edge), which prevent food from sticking to the blade. </p>
<p> But the most significant difference between western and eastern chef knife is the way it handles. </p>
<p> While German and French chef knives should be moved back and forward in a more of a slicing motion, the Santoku knife should typically be used in more of a chopping motion. </p>
<p> Japanese and European Chef's Knives in Comparison </p>
<p> Both professionals and hobby chefs are still debating how much Japanese or European Chef’s Knives are preferable. Both cultures have a long tradition of blacksmithing and have produced high quality, stable, and sharp knives for home cooks as well as professional chefs for decades. </p>
<p> While in Japan, the Santoku stands above all for the outstanding art of cutting, the German and French Chef’s knives also have a long and firm tradition. </p>
<p> For which of the two knife cultures you decide, your personal preference and the experience that you have made with both types of knives will probably be a deciding factor. </p>
<p> Western European Types (German and French) </p>
<p> European Chef’s Knives are characterized mainly by the U-cut of the blade. This predestines for the liquid, graceful weighing cut, which ensures rapid processing of, especially softer ingredients. </p>
<p> Besides, the blades are considered very robust. Due to this robustness, the handling of the knives is also very uncomplicated. The cutting technique is almost irrelevant with European knives as they have very sturdy cutting edges. </p>
<p> Eastern Asian and Japanese Type (Santoku) </p>
<p> Japanese Chef’s Knives, on the other hand, are generally considered to be very sharp, sharper than their European equivalent. This is mainly due to the V-cut of the edge, which makes the blades more efficient. </p>
<p> However, this particular sharpening, in conjunction with the manufacture of the blade, also provides for more significant challenges in handling the Japanese knives. </p>
<p> Chopping and pruning cuts should be avoided with Japanese knives as much as possible. The blades react very sensitively, resulting in a break or at least a rapid wear. </p>
<p> Also, if hard cutting pads are used, such as stone boards, the blades will not hold an edge for long. With the increasing sharpness of the Japanese blade, increased sensitivity of the same goes hand in hand. </p>
<p> Which One to Choose? (Western Model or a Santoku) </p>
<p> If you are thinking of buying your first Damascus knife, but can’t decide which one, then getting a Chef’s knife is your best option. Whether you decide on a classic model or a Santoku, once you start using it, it will become the one knife that you will use the most. </p>
<p> There are many designs available in our store, and since these are the most popular types of knives, we make sure always to have plenty to offer. </p>
<p> If you are in doubt about which model will suit your needs best, here’s our word of advice: </p>
<p> If you are a ‘meat’ person and often cook with meat, then a western version of a Damascus Chef’s Knife is a slightly better choice. Having a more definite point at the tip gives you a bit extra maneuvering space when working with meat, as it usually requires more slicing. </p>
<p> If you are a vegetarian or you like to cook ‘Asian style food,’ then getting a Damascus Santoku Knife is the right choice for you. Chopping and cutting fresh vegetables is a pleasure with this type of knife, and it will add a touch of the eastern spirit to your cooking experience. </p>
<p> What is the Price of High Grade Damascus Chef's Knives? </p>
<p> Many chef’s knives are already available for very affordable prices. Whether you buy individual blades or opt for a knife set, both can be purchased at a budget. </p>
<p> However, one must be aware that with the low price also the quality suffers. Very cheap knives wear out quickly, are often poorly processed, and cause more frustration in the kitchen instead of bringing pleasure in cooking. </p>
<p> A better quality chef’s knives are available from about $60 to $100. Upwards, the price range is open. Higher-end knives usually move in a price range between $100 to $500. </p>
<p> Professional chef’s knives are usually more expensive than $200, and some custom made or special steel consumer blades can even reach the prices above $5000. The highest priced Damascus Chef’s Knife costs around 80.000 EUR. </p>
<p> Several factors determine the final price. Not only the materials used but also the degree of manual work that has gone into production is crucial. </p>
<p> Damascus kitchen knives are generally more expensive than stainless steel kitchen knives because of their elaborate production. </p>
<p> If the sharpening of the blade is carried out personally by the blacksmith master, this also affects the price of the chef’s knife. </p>
<p> Quick Buyer's Guide to Chef's Knives - What to Look For? </p>
<p> Before you go out and buy a chef’s knife, you should inform yourself what to look for when purchasing such a knife. </p>
<p> The mindless purchase of inferior goods eventually leads to more frustration and thus wasted money. If you pay attention to a few small things, you can make sure already at the purchase that you will enjoy your knife for a long time. </p>
<p> The Handle (Grip) Materials </p>
<p> First, consider the handle of the knife. The materials used here already play an important role when it comes to how efficiently you can work with the knife and how long it will last. </p>
<p> Often either wood, plastic, or composite materials are used for the handle of cooking knives. Pay attention to the use of high-quality materials. Pakka wood, Rosewood, Dalbergia and Ebony are a golden standard for wooden grips while Micarta and G-10 are favorable composite materials. The handle should be made in one piece with no chipping or cracks. Also, the handle should be ergonomically shaped. This means that it is comfortable to hold and is easy to guide when cutting. </p>
<p> Ergonomics of the Grip and Blade </p>
<p> There are many designs of the handles and blades. Most modern kitchen knives are designed in a way they can be comfortably held and used for a longer period of time. </p>
<p> The ergonomics of the grip brings the following advantages: </p>
<p> The handle is comfortable in hand. If you cover the knife with your hand, the handle in the palm of your hand does not hurt. It optimally adapts to the contour of your palm. </p>
<p> The knife is also pleasant to use in the long term. Even if you use the knife persistently, no signs of fatigue occur in your hand. </p>
<p> Knife Weight and Balance </p>
<p> Also, the weight of the knife plays a significant role and should not be underestimated. The blade should not be too heavy, but also not too light. It should be just right. </p>
<p> The length and height of the blade should be tailored to your needs. This means that the knife is suitable in length and width to allow the desired ingredient to be cut. But it also should fit well into your hand. While big knives fit well in big hands, people with small hands should instead resort to smaller kitchen knives. </p>
<p> Balance is extremely important, especially with larger knives (such as Chef’s knives). It is desired that the central balance is at the bolster. This means that if you hold a knife on your finger at the place where the blade connects to the handle, the knife won’t tip and will stay level. </p>
<p> A proper balance ensures good guidance and comfortable cutting and slicing. </p>
<p> Aesthetics and Finish Processing </p>
<p> Finally, you should pay attention to the processing of the handle and blade. The entire knife must appear as one piece. There must be no grooves or holes. When cutting food, leftovers can stick inside, which can cause mold and harmful bacteria to develop. </p>
<p> Besides, you should carefully examine the blade of the knife. </p>
<p> The knife should have a glossy surface, regardless if it is stainless steel, a Damascus, or hammered steel. This indicates that the chef’s knife was not only honed but also polished. A glossy finish ensures that the blade is optimally protected against rust and moisture damage. </p>
<p> Materials and Steel Types </p>
<p> The materials play a significant role in buying the right knife. Handle, and the blade should only be made of high quality, durable materials. The quality of the materials used determines how long you will enjoy the chosen chef’s knife. </p>
<p> The preferred steel hardness for a beginner should reach the levels at around 60 HRC. The most popular and widely used steel for kitchen chef knives are nowadays VG-10, AUS-10, and 10Cr15CoMoV. </p>
<p> Blades made from these types of steel are hard but not brittle and can be grinded to a razor-sharp finish. </p>
<p> Advantages and Disadvantages </p>
<p> Anyone who wants to put together his kitchen equipment or upgrade it stands in front of a decision whether he should get one or more chef’s knives, or will rely only on individual special knives. </p>
<p> The advantages of chef’s knives are their universal applications. The same knife can be used for different ingredients and applications, making a change of tools unnecessary. This can be a considerable relief, especially after a stressful working day. Also, chef’s knives are available in different lengths and widths so that everyone will find the right knife for their hands and their needs. Besides, they do not have to be expensive – the chef’s knives are already available at an affordable price and are, therefore, easy on the budget. </p>
<p> However, the chef’s knife as a universal tool can also be a disadvantage. A knife that is used for different ingredients wears out faster. Not only that, the various structures can attack the cutting surfaces, but the blade is also used more frequently. With that in mind, cheap models require more intensive care because they become dull faster and must be re-sharpened more regularly. </p>

<p> How to Use a Chef's Knife? </p>
<p> If you want to learn a proper way of using a chef’s knife, take a look at this short video which explains some of the essential cutting and slicing techniques. Next time when you hold your knife in hand, try to follow the advice given in the video. From here on, only the practice makes perfect. </p>
<p> Maintenance </p>
<p> To enjoy your chef’s knives for as long as possible, you should pay particular attention to two aspects: careful handling and proper care. Both factors inevitably interact and can hardly be separated from each other. If these two aspects are respected, your chef’s knife should stay sharp for a long time. </p>
<p> First, you should pay attention to the careful handling of the chef’s knife. This includes making sure to use a suitable cutting pad. The pad must not be too hard. Otherwise, the blade will wear out quickly. Avoid cutting boards made of stone or glass. These materials damage the blade the most. It is best to use wooden or plastic boards that are tough, but do not dull the knife that much. </p>
<p> Also, make sure you make soft, not too abrupt cuts. Hard chopping or strong levering can ruin the blade of the chef’s knife. </p>
<p> The right care is also crucial so that the knife stays sharp for a long time. Always clean your chef’s knife by hand. In the dishwasher, the blades are severely worn, and many cleaners are too hot for sensitive blades. Rinse the knife in warm but not too hot water and use a mild detergent. Afterward, the knife should be adequately dried. For this, we recommend rubbing with a soft cloth and then draining, so that also the handle dries thoroughly. </p>
<p> If you want to sharpen your knife, you have three options: the sharpening steel, the sharpening rod, or the sharpening stone (whetstone). All three variants have their advantages and disadvantages. The most recommendable is sharpening with the whetstone because it achieves the most efficient results due to its differently grained sides. Especially for Damascus chef’s knives, it is recommended to sharpen them on a whetstone to achieve the best possible result. </p>
<p> If you want to take care of your knives optimally, then you should bring them to a professional knife sharpener every six months. </p>
<p> Storage </p>
<p> In addition to proper care and careful handling of a chef’s knife, adequate storage is one of the factors that determine the longevity of such a knife. </p>
<p> One thing is sure: If you want to enjoy your chef’s knife for a long time, you should not keep it in a drawer with other knives or other cutlery. In a drawer, the cutlery rubs against each other, resulting in wear and damage of the blades. The rash storage of the knives in a full cutlery drawer also makes high-quality chef’s knives dull and brittle. </p>
<p> To properly store a kitchen knife, there are different options available. </p>
<p> In case you don’t want to move away from storage in the drawer, you can opt for blade covers. These covers are slipped over the blade after cleaning and prevent the blades from rubbing against other pieces of cutlery. </p>
<p> Another popular storage option is the classic knife block. These knife blocks were initially made only of wood, which was gentle on the blade and prevented a grind when inserting or pulling out. Nowadays, you can also get knife blocks made of plastic or glass. The advantage of all blocks is that each knife is stored individually and is quickly available with just one pull. Also, a high-quality knife block can be quite decorative. </p>
<p> Professional chefs, who often cook in different locations, prefer knife bags. These are flexible fabric bags that have slots for each professional chef’s knife. In such bags, multiple knives can be stored. The bag rolls up easily or folds and ties with the help of a tape or string. So not only do you always have your knives together, but you can easily take the collection everywhere with you. Many combine the knife bags with individual blade covers. </p>
<p> A fourth variant is the increasingly popular magnetic strips. These are fastened to the wall above the stove or near the kitchen worktop. With the help of magnetic attraction, you can attach your chef’s knife with the blade to this bar and thus always have your knife collection in view. Such strips avoid that the blades rub against each other. It is essential that you always fold the knife over the back of the blade and never over the cutting edge when attaching and removing it from a magnetic strip. </p>

<p> Beef. It's What's For Dinner. Chef Recipes </p>
<p> Whether it’s a tried-and-true Sunday supper classic or an unexpected twist to savory beef comfort food, the expert chefs at Beef. It’s What’s For Dinner. are sharing their much-loved, hand-crafted, all-time-favorite recipes. Bon appétit! </p>
<p> I love beef Short Ribs that are cut Flanken-style. They can be cooked in a short time and can be eaten right off the bone. A simple marinade gives them such a great flavor. This recipe takes me back to Fourth of July parties with family and friends. - Chef Pam Nash </p>
<p> This dip is similar to a recipe that my aunt used to make for me and my siblings when we spent summers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I always loved it! Many of the ranchers that I work with say they often serve a version of this as a spread on sandwiches to their farm or ranch crews. That feedback inspired me greatly. - Chef Laura Hagen </p>
<p> For a few summers when I was a teenager, my dad opened a chuckwagon outside the stables at the Elkhorn Lodge in Estes Park, Colorado. After a trail ride, customers could pull up a bale of straw, enjoy the sunset and dine outside. The menu would often consist of steak, cowboy beans and corn on the cob, all made on an open fire. - Chef Laura Majors </p>
<p> Growing up on a farm and dairy, beef stew was something my mother and grandmothers would prepare to warm us up after a long day of working outside doing chores in the cold. I updated a traditional beef stew recipe to include the African chili blend, harissa. - Chef Barry Strand </p>
<p> I love this braised Brisket recipe because it reminds me of my family, the great times cooking together and eating around the dinner table. It’s a very recognizable aroma when you walk into a home and someone has a Brisket going. The aroma is one of comfort, coziness and it makes me smile. - Chef Marci Levine </p>
<p> Growing up, Sunday was always the day for beef roasts. This recipe is perfect for Sunday supper and has an Old West chuckwagon appeal. The bitter notes from the coffee powder, the sweet notes from the brown sugar, along with the umami in the beef, marry well with the compote. - Chef Dave Zino </p>
<p> keep exploring: </p>
<p> Crafted by ranchers across America, these recipes are flavorful, nutritious and proven to satisfy the heartiest of appetites. </p>

<p> Seven chefs on their favourite cut of steak, and how best to cook it </p>
<p> From ribs to T-bones, these are the cuts chefs eat when they’re rattling the pans at home. </p>
<p> May 04, 2018 1:21am </p>
<p> By Mahalia Chang </p>
<p> Like coffee orders, the way you have your eggs, or your opinion on coriander, everyone has a preference for how they like their steak. For every diner who prefers theirs cooked rare to the point of bloody, others enjoy a tougher cook; some prefer bony cuts, while others flock to fillets. When it comes to chefs and butchers, those preferences are even more complicated. </p>
<p> We grilled some of Australia's top steak masters to find out whether they like their meat well-done, or done well. </p>
<p> Andrew McConnell, Cutler & Co., Melbourne </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "The rib-eye. I like all the different elements; the muscles, the flavours, the marbling… and I always cook it on the bone. I like that it's a great cut to carve and share with others." </p>
<p> What do you look for at the butcher? "When selecting a cut, provenance is so important. I always make sure rib-eyes have been dried for up to four weeks minimum as it improves the flavour and texture. And the other thing I'm looking at is breed. I love Angus, but I recently cooked a dried Murray Grey rib-eye and it was amazing." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "First I clean the cut and pat it dry, then season it heavily with coarse sea salt. I always cook it over wood and coals. I light a fire, let the coals die down and then put it on. I turn it frequently as it cooks, so it develops a good golden crust. If I have company, I'll get a standing rib roast, which is a large piece with three or four ribs, which I'll cook over a more gentle heat with the barbecue lid down. Depending on the cut and how thick it is, it can take up to 20 to 25 minutes. </p>
<p> "I cook my steaks medium-rare; I think the cut eats a lot better like that with a better texture. After cooking, I rest my steaks for as long as I cook it for – so if I cook it for 20 minutes, I rest it for 20 minutes." </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "I cut it, following the line of the bone, and serve it with Dijon mustard, some fresh horseradish and a gratin, with layered potatoes and anchovies. As a healthy concession, I'll do a salad with cos-berg lettuce with a good vinegar and oil. I'm a purist!" </p>
<p> Anthony Puharich, Victor Churchill, Sydney </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "This is about the most difficult question you could ask a butcher, so I have to say two. A thick-cut T-bone – what the Italians call bistecca, nothing that's cut less than a kilo or a kilo-and-a-half in thickness – and the inside skirt. </p>
<p> What do you look for at the butcher? "Marbling and meat colour are important – they're visual cues for determining the quality of that particular piece – but the most important thing for me is provenance and animal husbandry. Where the meat came from, how it was grown, is it grass-fed or grain-fed, the breed… it's the ultimate way of guaranteeing a good piece of meat." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "I make sure the cut is room temperature then I season it with good-quality sea-salt flakes – I'm not a big pepper person. There's only one cooking method for me, which is a cast-iron grill over charcoal or wood. I haven't cooked anything on anything else in 12 years." </p>
<p> "I start with a high heat – if it's too low, it'll stew – you want it to sear and caramelise and get a great crust. I don't turn it or prod it too many times because it releases all the juices, then I rest it for half the cooking time. </p>
<p> "In my opinion, medium-rare is the only way to enjoy a piece of meat its optimum – the levels of juiciness, tenderness and flavour are at their ideal. </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "If I'm cooking a bigger cut I prefer the feasting style, so I'll serve roasted potatoes in duck fat, steamed vegetables, a salad, with mustards, horseradish and chimichurri on the side." </p>
<p> Elvis Abrahanowicz, Porteño, Sydney </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "Beef short ribs. It's the way I grew up; ribs are a classic for the grill in Argentina. The meat's got texture, a nice amount of fat and a lot of bones!" </p>
<p> What do you look for at the butcher? "I don't worry too much over colour or marbling, it's usually the size and thickness I'm focused on. Sometimes butchers will remove the top layer so it's just the bones and meat, but I prefer the fat layer and belly flap attached." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "I take the meat out of the fridge and season it with a bit of salt straight away - any salt will do - and cover it with a tea towel. Then I barbecue it over charcoal. My dad has always done it this way and it's the way I do it – there's no other method for me. I prefer it medium, maybe medium-well. With ribs, you have to cook them a bit more, otherwise they're too chewy. </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "I like mine hot – straight off the barbecue – so I don't rest it at all. In my eyes, the fat's best when it's hot. I serve it with an onion and tomato salad – ripe tomatoes, white onions, olive oil and red-wine vinegar – and homemade chimichurri." </p>
<p> Ben Milgate, Porteño Restaurant, Sydney </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "Beef short ribs; you can braise it, grill it, and it has the perfect amount of fat so it stays juicy – and the texture is incredible. It's not like a fillet which is an 'easy steak', you have to work to get the most out of this cut." </p>
<p> What do you look for at the butcher? "Bright red colour and lots of marbling. Beef short rib has a real fat layer, so that's also what I'm looking for." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "I pull it out of the fridge a couple of hours before I cook it so it cools to room temperature. Then I'll sprinkle some sea salt flakes over it. About half an hour before I start cooking, I get a thin layer of charcoal going. Because of the fat content of this cut, you get fat dripping onto the charcoal so there's smoke – this creates a nice, slow heat. </p>
<p> "With ribs I veer towards medium-well with just a little blush-pink in the centre. If you cook it a bit longer, it helps all that fat break down and become nice and juicy. After it comes off the barbecue, I'll rest it for 10 to 15 minutes. </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "With chimichurri, and potatoes on the side. I'll parboil them in really salty water, then put them in a heavy tray with olive oil and bake." </p>
<p> Jacques Reymond, Bistro Gitan, Melbourne </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "Bavette; I was born in Cuiseaux where France's largest abattoir is and bavette was the most sought-after cut as it was cheap and readily available." </p>
<p> What do you look for at the butcher? "A thick, odourless cut that's bright and still has the thin membranes surrounding it intact." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "I make sure the meat is at room temperature and massaged gently before cooking – I don't add any seasoning – then I cook it on a churrascaria." </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "Because of the particular texture of the bavette it can be thinly sliced horizontally or vertically. When I plate it up, I serve it with a compound butter, anchovies, olives, capers and parsley." </p>
<p> Lennox Hastie, Firedoor, Sydney </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "The rib-eye cap – or deckle – it's essentially taking a rib-eye and taking the best bit out of it. It's amazing in terms of flavour profiles, it's super-tender like a meat butter. </p>
<p> What do you look for at the butcher? "Breed and producer. Some of the breeds that have a dairy background, like a Jersey or a Dexter, I find have a better flavour profile." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "I'm straight up – I bring it up to room temperature, make sure it's nice and dry so it caramelises, then I salt it with fleur de sel when it hits the grill. I prefer to use a wood-fire grill with grapevine or grape shoots. When you cook with a wood fire you get this amazing crunchy crust, and then the meat melts in the mouth. It's that change in texture I'm looking for. </p>
<p> "I'll have steak more on the rare side – more rare-medium, over medium-rare!" </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "With a simple salad – crisp lettuce and sweet onion. No sauces or relishes on the meat. It's rich enough with the fat complex that you don't need anything else with it." </p>
<p> Shannon Kellam, Montrachet, Brisbane </p>
<p> Favourite cut? "My preference is the rib fillet." </p>
<p> How do you prepare and cook it? "I season it with salt and cracked pepper using a good-quality table salt, no fancy stuff. Sea-salt flakes don't coat the meat evenly so I like to use a fine salt. I cook it in a very good-quality cast-iron pan using a minimal amount of olive oil. </p>
<p> When the steak is really nicely caramelised on both sides and medium-rare, I'll then rest it in a clarified butter bath which sits on top of an induction at 48 degrees. This keeps the meat warm but doesn't cook it anymore. After this, I'll take the steak out and caramelise it again. </p>
<p> How do you serve it up? "I add sprigs of thyme and a little bit of foaming butter to the meat. As for sides, I like homemade French fries or aligot potatoes, a green salad, and sautéed green beans with tarragon butter. I like to serve it in a béarnaise or a Roquefort sauce." </p>

<p> ‘Chef’s Table’ Recap: Massimo Bottura Became a Star by Turning Italian Tradition Upside Down </p>
<p> Italians hated his food at first, but they learned to respect his modernist approach </p>
<p> Share this story </p>
<p> Share All sharing options for: ‘Chef’s Table’ Recap: Massimo Bottura Became a Star by Turning Italian Tradition Upside Down </p>
<p> In the series premiere of Netflix’s culinary documentary Chef’s Table, creator David Gelb and his crew introduced viewers to Italian chef Massimo Bottura. He is one of the most celebrated chefs on the planet and owner of Osteria Francescana, one of the most acclaimed restaurants in the world. At Francescana in the ancient city of Modena, Bottura takes traditional Italian dishes and turns them on their head with modern and innovative techniques. The restaurant claims three Michelin stars and was No. 1 on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2016. </p>
<p> What was Bottura’s journey through the culinary world like? </p>
<p> Bottura grew up with a large family in close quarters: his parents, grandparents, three older brothers, and one younger sister all living under one roof. His love of food was forged at an early age, when he would hide under the kitchen table while his grandmother made tortellino, stealing the pieces that fell to the floor. Bottura opened his first restaurant, Trattoria del Campazzo, in Modena shortly after graduating from university in the late 1980s, but he left after a couple of years to work in kitchens in New York City. There, he met his future wife, Lara Gilmore. </p>
<p> The two parted ways for a bit while Bottura worked for renowned chef Alain Ducasse in Paris, but reunification eventually came in New York, and in the mid-’90s, they moved back to Modena and purchased the restaurant space that would become Francescana. On opening day, Bottura asked Gilmore to marry him. </p>
<p> Locals jeered Bottura in the early years of Francescana’s existence, taking the chef to task for meddling with sacred recipes. Over time, however, critics and diners with modern sensibilities became interested, and Bottura was soon recognized as one of the best and most creative chefs in the world. </p>
<p> What was his “aha” moment? </p>
<p> In a Venice art gallery in 1997, Bottura observed an instillation depicting taxidermied pigeons in the rafters defecating on older works of art. This was a bolt of lightning, and it made the chef realize what he had to do to Italian cuisine. </p>
<p> What do people, including Bottura, say about his work? </p>
<p> “He’s arrived at his own formula for what being a three-Michelin-star [restaurant] is about. For Massimo, it’s about the art, it’s about the music, it’s about the place, it’s about the ingredients. It’s not just about the food, it’s about the whole concept behind the food that makes it into something far more interesting.” — Faith Willinger, Food & Wine, on Bottura’s cooking philosophy </p>
<p> “We’ll have been at the movies and we’ll walk out of the movies, and I’ll say, ‘So, what’d you think about the film?’ And he’ll say, ‘I don’t know; I wasn’t really paying attention. I was thinking about a way of making mozzarella invisible. And if you could drink that, and have all the flavor of tomato and mozzarella, how cool would that be?’ And I would think, ‘God, he really didn’t watch the movie.’” — Lara Gilmore on Bottura’s relentless creativity </p>
<p> “Every time I open [a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano] cheese like this, I get emotional. You know, it’s unbelievable. When I say, ‘In my blood there’s balsamic vinegar and my muscles are made by Parmigiano,’ it is true. It is true.” — Bottura on his love of cheese </p>
<p> “Can you imagine what the locals were thinking about us? They wanted me dead. You know, you cannot mess with Grandmother’s recipe.” — Bottura on the initial reaction to his modernist cuisine </p>
<p> “Years later, looking back on it, asking me to marry him on the same day we opened the restaurant was his subtle way of saying, ‘Are you ready to marry a restaurant?’ Yes, the chef comes with it, the husband comes with it, the family comes with it, but basically, I married a restaurant. So the restaurant, to me, has never been something that took my husband away from me. The restaurant has always been our family, and a big family.” — Gilmore on her life with Osteria Francescana </p>

<p> Chicken Parmesan </p>
<p> My version of chicken parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust. </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside. </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides. </p>
<p> Step 6 </p>
<p> Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts for about 15 minutes. </p>
<p> Step 7 </p>
<p> Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. </p>
<p> Step 8 </p>
<p> Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. </p>
<p> Step 9 </p>
<p> Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </p>
<p> I Made It Print </p>
<p> Cook's Note: </p>
<p> Use high-quality prepared tomato sauce for a better end result. You may substitute pesto or dried Italian herbs of your choice for basil, or omit entirely. If using fresh mozzarella, cut it into cubes instead of shredding it. </p>

<p> 3 stars because this was good with my common sense modifications. I do not know how any one of you got a good result as written. #1 - 4 c. of breadcrumbs?! Whoa! Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to 'eye this up' and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded, not 'fresh' for best melting result. #6- Don't put fresh basil on so early.

<p> This recipe was really easy to follow & turned out great! My 1st try at chicken parmesan, total success :-) Read More </p>
<p> Have to admit if it's not easy and/or tasty I won't put the effort in. The WHOLE famiily loved this, and every recipe gets easier each time its' made, right? I only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn't use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in, and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this, and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great! Given that I had twice as many fillets, next time, I would probably use half the oil, so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.) As much as I loved this recipe, given the calories/fat, I would not make it as often as I'd like. 10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner, the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it's not as crispy, I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk, then cut, trim, and pound with mallet before freezing for later use, this saves lots of time during actual recipe. Read More </p>
<p> Some time ago, I learned a useful trick: instead of steps 3-6 above, after the chicken breasts have been pounded and seasoned as in step 2, lightly brush both sides with heavy 33-35%MF whipping cream (use a pastry brush). Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4, pressing the crumbs into both sides. I now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading, including fish, pork, veal, etc. It is easier and less messy than using flour, eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well.

<p> All I can say is Wow! I have made chicken parmesan using the most popular recipe from this site, but this recipe blew the other out of the park! This is a no brainer. My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews, does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part, however, made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won't hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat! Read More </p>
<p> Incredible dish! Great for dinner guests. For those folks cooking in high altitude 15 or 20 minutes is not quite enough to cook the chicken breasts. You might want to cook them a little longer (6-7 minutes) on top of the stove or microwave them for several minutes (3 minutes)before serving. Cut them in half to check doneness before serving. If you put them back in the oven for too long the cheese might burn. Read More </p>
<p> I made this exactly as directed and it was GREAT! So easy and fast - fabulous use of bnls/sknls chicken breast. It came out moist & tender with the crunchy top - perfect. Served it on angel hair pasta with buttered italian bread and it was a hit. Thank you John - your wife is lucky to have you! I love your videos & sense of humor, and your food is excellent!

<p> Authentic Italian Chicken Parmigiana </p>
<p> Authentic Italian Chicken Parmigiana recipe requires only a few simple ingredients to make it stand out. Pan-fried chicken breasts are juicy, tender, and full of flavor. Chicken cutlets are seasoned with simple spices, then coated in bread crumbs to achieve a crispy golden crust. They are baked to perfection in classic Marinara tomato sauce and melted Mozzarella cheese. So easy! </p>
<p> Aaahhh, cheesy Baked Chicken Parmesan. It’s one of our family’s favorites along with Parmesan Crusted Chicken. I remember making it for the first time years ago and wondering why it took me so long to try it! Well, it’s about time I share an easy Chicken Parmesan recipe for those of you who prefer an easy weeknight dinner. A good Chicken Parmigiana does require quite a bit in the way of seasoning and shredded cheese, but I’ve kept things super simple in this recipe. This classic Italian-American food doesn’t get much easier than this! </p>
<p> How to make chicken parmigiana </p>
<p> In this authentic Italian recipe, a fried breaded chicken breast is topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese. The coating is very crispy and easy to prepare! </p>
<p> First, you will need to coat the chicken. In order to do that, prepare 3 wide plates, or bowls. One for Parmesan, the other – for whisked egg and third one for seasoning mixture. Be generous with seasoning! </p>
<p> Then you will pan-fry the chicken. Once chicken is browned, you will layer it with Mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. Delicious! </p>
<p> Lastly, bake it in the same pan for about 30 minutes and then serve it with fresh basil. These easy chicken breasts coated in Parmesan and Mozzarella cheeses are the perfect easy dinner to serve on busy weeknights. Done! </p>
<p> These easy chicken breasts coated in Parmesan and Mozzarella cheeses are the perfect easy dinner to serve on busy weeknights. </p>
<p> What kind of chicken works best </p>
<p> For chicken parmesan you can use either chicken breast or thin chicken cutlets. The difference? While the chicken breast is large and thick, a chicken cutlet is a slice of meat cut from a chicken breast. It is much thinner than the whole breast. </p>
<p> Breadcrumbs Substitutes </p>
<p> If you do not wish to use breadcrumbs, you can substitute with almond flour, cracker crumbs, old-fashion oats, or crushed corn flakes. I also saw some stores carry gluten free breading crumbs made from chickpeas. </p>
<p> How to make chicken parmigiana in pictures </p>
<p> I recommend that you prepare 3 wide plates, or bowls. As you can see, one is for grated Parmesan, the other – for whisked egg, and the third one – for seasoning mixture.Next you will coat chicken cutlets by dipping each chicken breast in every bowl/plate.You will then pan-fry these coated chicken breasts. Once they are done, layer them with Mozzarella cheese and Marinara sauce. Of course, you can also top the chicken cutlets with the sauce first, and cheese on top, but I found that cheese first method makes Chicken parm taste juicier.I added Mozzarella slices first and spooned the tomato sauce next.Sprinkle with shredded cheese. </p>
<p> Lastly, you will bake your chicken parmigiana in the same pan for about 30 minutes and then serve it with fresh basil. </p>
<p> WHAT KIND OF SEASONING SHOULD I USE FOR CHICKEN PARM </p>
<p> Because chicken breasts have a mild flavor, they need to be generously seasoned to impart enough flavor. For this easy Pollo Alla parmigiana recipe, I seasoned the chicken with plenty of Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. </p>
<p> AT WHAT OVEN TEMPERATURE TO BAKE CHICKEN PARMESAN? </p>
<p> For this recipe, I bake the chicken breasts in a 375 degrees oven. It makes for a deliciously filling Sunday dinner and the best part is that it is ready in under 40 minutes! </p>
<p> What should I serve with homemade Chicken Parmesan? </p>
<p> While the simple chicken parm is great on its own, adding pasta truly makes chicken parmigiana a full, complete meal! This combination goes all the way back to the first Italian immigrants. Once settled in a thriving America, they discovered that the ingredients for the marinara sauce were abundant. So they paired these foods with another widely available Italian food: spaghetti. That’s why today many people automatically think of chicken parmesan as a pasta dish. </p>
<p> I also frequently make this classic Italian dish into a Chicken Parmesan sandwich. A crispy breaded chicken cutlet is placed between a nice crusty bread and topped with classic Marinara and cheese! Underneath all that bubbly cheese, you will bite into a tender chicken breast. Well, what can you say? This homemade Chicken Parmesan recipe produces the most succulent, tender, juicy and flavorful chicken breasts! Perfect for sandwiches! </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Set up a line of 3 bowls or wide plates. Place 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan in a large plate or bowl. In the second medium bowl, whisk the egg. In the third bowl mix together bread crumbs, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. </p>
<p> Bread the Chicken: Dip chicken breasts in the Parmesan bowl first, and coat on both sides. Then, transfer coated chicken and dip in egg bowl on both sides. Last, dip both sides of chicken in bread crumbs mixture in the third bowl. Evenly coat and pack breadcrumbs lightly with your hand. Shake off any excess breading and repeat with the remaining chicken. </p>
<p> Sear the Chicken: Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet or pan and brown chicken for 3 minutes on each side, fora total of 6 minutes for both sides. I browned 2 chickens at a time. </p>
<p> Bake Chicken: Preheat oven at 375 F. Lay browned chicken in the same oven proof cast iron skillet (or a baking dish). Layer chicken with mozzarella slices. Then add marinara sauce over top. Scatter shredded Mozzarella and remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan on top of Marinara. Bake for 30 minutes until sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes. </p>
<p> Sprinkle with fresh basil and serve with spaghetti. </p>

<p> I made this tonight gluten free and it turned out amazing. Even my husband that is not a fan of gluten free food thought this was delicious. To make panko crumbs I used rice chex cereal and crushed to the consistency of bread crumbs. I also used gluten free flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe that I will make many times in the future. </p>
<p> I have a question. Since there is no such thing as chicken parmigiana here in Italy, how can this be an authentic Italian recipe for chicken parmigiana? </p>
<p> I made this yesterday and it was delicious ! The recipe is perfect – thanks so muc! </p>

<p> ITALIAN CHOP CHOP SALAD </p>
<p> We’re stoked to finally share a behind the scenes look at our new favorite salad for the Summer. We call it the Italian Chop Chop, an Italian inspired salad so nice we named it twice. Watch the video below and take a deeper look with Senior Vice President of Culinary and Menu Innovation Chef Matt Harding: </p>
<p> The star of the Italian Chop Chop Salad is our muffaletta, a finely diced relish made from green & black olives, pickled celery, cauliflower, carrots, sweet peppers, red onions, parsley, pepperoncini, garlic, and a blend of spices that bring a subtle spicy kick to the party. We build the salad with crisp romaine & cabbage and add our sweet & spicy peppers, feta, toasted parmesan crisps, sliced pepperoni and a healthy scoop of muffaletta. Finally, we dress it up with our new in-house-made Italian vinaigrette, a bright and tangy dressing blended with fresh pepperoncini peppers, garlic, oregano, thyme, olive oil, & white balsamic vinegar. Fast and fresh; this might be the best salad you have all summer. The Italian Chop Chop salad is available today at a local Piada restaurant near you. But stop in quick: it’s only around for a limited time! </p>

<p> Italian Chopped Salad </p>
<p> Searching for a unique main that’s easy to prepare and packed with flavour? Look no further – this ITALIAN CHOPPED SALAD is perfezionare!!! </p>
<p> I’ll lay it right out from the get-go: this salad involves chopping, but I assume you expected that from a classic chopped salad. This salad is so worth the effort though, a tasty treat that always earns its fair share of praise. In fact, it’s one of our most requested salad recipes to date. </p>
<p> I love this for a number of reasons, but top marks go to being a great make-ahead dish. You can prep the salad dressing and chop everything except the romaine, tomatoes and radicchio in advance. Once that’s done, store the ingredients in airtight containers and place them in a cooler. This makes assembling and dressing the salad a breeze once you’ve arrived at the cottage or your weekend destination – this fabulous meal hits the table in no time. </p>
<p> If you’ve ever wondered how to make a chopped salad, here’s your step-by-step guide. Get chopping and enjoy! </p>
<p> THE DRESSING </p>
<p> I like using a traditional, homemade Italian dressing for this salad. Nothing too complicated to make it, just oil, vinegar, some herbs, a few flavour enhancers and you’re done. </p>
<p> Click HERE to view our one-minute City Slicker video on how to prepare this simple, tasty dressing that works not only for this salad but many others too. Suggestion: might as well double the recipe from the outset so that you have extra. </p>
<p> THE INGREDIENTS </p>
<p> Of course, the sky’s the limit on what you can add to this salad, but I like using ingredients that hold their shape once chopped. I suggest not using anything too delicate and as always try to use locally grown veggies whenever possible. </p>
<p> The salami and provolone cheese are essential to this recipe, and one reader wrote in telling us that the inclusion of these distinctive ingredients makes this a Tuscan chopped salad. Who knew? Look for salami made with fennel and peppercorns to add a bit of punch. When selecting your cheese, try mild provolone to impart a subtle dairy taste. </p>
<p> THE TOSS </p>
<p> Dressing this salad is easy enough, but prepare to be amazed by what happens when a superior dressing meets the perfect combination of flavourful ingredients. After dressing your chopped salad, give it a taste and then add more dressing, salt and pepper to taste. You can also let the salad stand for a bit before you serve just to let all the flavours mix and meld. </p>
<p> This recipe will serve six guests or more, but don’t worry if you have leftovers – the salad will still taste wonderful, if not better, the following day. We enjoy serving it with our ROASTED GARLIC CHEESE BREAD and a chilled glass of Pinot Grigio. For dessert, try our RHUBARB PANNA COTTA, it’s so fabulous. </p>
<p> Preparing this CHOPPED SALAD is so worth the effort and makes for a delicious luncheon or dinner treat. Enjoy! </p>
<p> […] salad is essentially a cross between our SALADE NIÇOISE and our CHOPPED SALAD. I think it perfect for a warm summer day and I especially like how it delivers big, bold flavours […] </p>

<doc id="file14874143" filename="Chopped_(TV_series)" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_(TV_series)">
<p> Chopped is an American reality-based cooking television game show series created by Michael Krupat, Dave Noll and Linda Lea. It is hosted by Ted Allen. The series pits four chefs against each other as they compete for a chance to win $10,000. New episodes air every Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on Food Network. </p>
<p> A dessert-themed spin-off titled Chopped Sweets premiered on February 3, 2020, with Scott Conant as host. </p>
<p> In each episode, four chefs compete in a three-round contest, where they attempt to incorporate unusual combinations of ingredients into dishes that are later evaluated by a panel of three judges.[1][2] At the beginning of each round (typically "Appetizer", "Entrée", and "Dessert", but with occasional exceptions), the chefs are each given a basket containing four mystery ingredients and are expected to create dishes that use all of them in some way. Although failing to use an ingredient is not an automatic disqualification, the judges do take such omissions into account when making their decisions. The ingredients are often not commonly prepared together. For example, in the episode "Yucca, Watermelon, Tortillas," the Appetizer ingredients consisted of watermelon, canned sardines, pepper jack cheese, and zucchini. The chefs are given unlimited access to a pantry and refrigerator stocked with a wide variety of other ingredients, and each chef has his/her own stations for preparing and cooking food. The kitchen also includes a variety of specialized tools and equipment for the chefs' use, such as a deep fryer, a blast chiller, and an ice cream machine. </p>
<p> Each round has a time limit, typically 20 minutes for Appetizer, and 30 minutes each for Entrée and Dessert. These limits have been extended on occasion for special-format episodes and for rounds in which one or more mystery ingredients require additional preparation/cooking time. The chefs must cook their dishes and complete four platings (three for the judges and one "beauty plate") before time runs out.[3] Once time has expired, the judges critique the dishes based on presentation, taste and creativity and select one chef to be "chopped" - eliminated from the competition with no winnings. Allen reveals the judges' decision by lifting a cloche on their table to show the losing chef's dish, and one of the judges comments on the reason for their choice to the eliminated chef. In the Dessert round, the judges consider not only the dishes created by the two chefs during that round, but also their overall performance throughout the competition. The winner receives $10,000, although in special competitions, winners can earn anywhere between $20,000 to $50,000. </p>
<p> Medical personnel are on hand to treat any injuries that occur during the competition and may, at their discretion, disqualify chefs who are unable to continue safely. If the judges deem a chef's dish unsafe to eat for any reason (contamination by blood or other bodily fluids, improper cooking, inedible items on the plate, etc.), they do not taste it but can still critique its presentation and creativity. </p>
<p> According to host Ted Allen, the show's unaired pilot episode, which was taped at the Culinary School at the Art Institute of New York, was "...originally a lot more elaborate. It was set in a mansion, the host was a butler, the butler held a Chihuahua, and when a chef was chopped the losing dish was fed to the Chihuahua." The Food Network found the pilot episode "a little too weird", but decided to keep the general premise of the show in a more straightforward competition format.[4] </p>
<p> An episode of Chopped takes approximately 12 hours to tape, with deliberations after each round taking about 20 minutes.[4] Judging is done by consensus among the judges.[5] </p>
<p> While contestants do not know the ingredients ahead of time, they are given a tour of the kitchen prior to taping. Some preliminary tasks, such as preheating ovens and bringing water to a boil, are done in advance of each round.[3] </p>
<p> Chefs must be 19 years or older to appear on the regular show. Teenagers and children are occasionally invited to compete in special episodes. </p>
<p> Starting September 8, 2009, Food Network aired a four-episode Chopped Champions tournament, in which 13 previous winners were invited to face off again. Four chefs competed per episode; the three losing chefs were eliminated from the tournament, while the winner received $10,000 and faced three new competitors in the next episode. </p>
<p> As of October 2018, the network has aired five additional Chopped Champions tournaments, each consisting of four preliminary heats and a finale. Four previous champions compete in each preliminary heat; the winner receives no money, but secures a slot in the finale to compete for a $50,000 grand prize. </p>
<p> Starting March 6, 2011, and continuing for four additional episodes, Food Network aired the "Chopped All-Stars" Tournament. Sixteen chefs competed. The first four episodes featured four types of chef: The Next Food Network Star contestants, Food Network celebrities, celebrity chefs, and Chopped judges. The winners of those four episodes then competed against each other in the "Grand Finale", where the winner received $50,000 to donate to a charity of his or her choice. Nate Appleman, a celebrity chef, won the competition and donated his $50,000 to Kawasaki Disease research, a disease from which his son suffered. </p>
<p> Starting April 8, 2012, and continuing for four additional episodes, Food Network aired the second "Chopped All-Stars" Tournament. Sixteen new chefs competed, again ranging from four different categories of chef: Iron Chef America chefs (the newest of the four categories), Food Network and Cooking Channel celebrities, The Next Food Network Star contestants, and Chopped judges. Celebrity chef & Chopped judge Marcus Samuelsson won this second competition, donating the $50,000 grand prize to the Careers Through Culinary Arts Program of New York (aka C-CAP), which helps under-served youth through culinary arts education and employment. </p>
<p> On April 7, 2013, the third installment of the "Chopped All-Stars" Tournament premiered on Food Network. Over the course of four episodes, sixteen chefs competed in groups of four. There were four different categories of the chefs through the episodes: Food Network vs. Cooking Channel, Mega Chefs, Chopped Judges, and celebrities, respectively. Winners of each of these rounds went on to compete against each other in the "Grand Finale" episode, where the winner received $50,000 to donate to a charity of his or her choice. Celebrity chef and Chopped judge Scott Conant won this competition, donating $50,000 to the Keep Memory Alive Foundation. </p>
<p> On April 28, 2015, the fourth "All-Stars" Tournament began airing, with an increased grand prize of $75,000 to the winner. As before, they are split into groups of four chefs per episode, with the winner of each of the first four episodes competing in the fifth "Grand Finale" episode for the top prize. Unlike previous tournaments, however, the 16 chefs involved were not split into "categories", but were sorted in what seems to be a more random fashion.[6] The winner was Anne Burrell who was playing for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. </p>
<p> Starting July 22, 2012, and continuing for four additional episodes, Food Network aired the "Chopped Grill Masters" Tournament. Sixteen "pro" grillers competed. The winners of the first four episodes competed against each other in the "Grand Finale" for a $50,000 prize. The "Grill Masters" episodes were taped outdoors at Old Tucson Studios near Tucson, AZ. The winner was Ernest Servantes, Executive Chef at Texas Lutheran University and Pit Boss at Burnt Bean Company.[7] </p>
<p> In the summer of 2015, a second "Grill Masters" Tournament occurred, and was sponsored by Lea & Perrins. Like the previous "Grill Masters" Tournament, it was filmed on location and 16 "pro" grillers competed. The 4 preliminary heat winners advanced to the finals where they would compete for a $50,000 grand prize. The winner was Angie Mar. The second heat of this particular tournament marked the first time that Chopped used a brand name on a basket ingredient, which in this case was the Worcestershire sauce, possibly because the ingredient was a product of tournament sponsor Lea & Perrins. </p>
<p> On July 5, 2016 another 5-part "Grill Masters" Tournament premiered. This tournament was taped at the Beringer Vineyards in Napa Valley, CA, and featured 16 "pro" grillers. In contrast to past tournaments, the 4 finalists each won a guaranteed $10,000 for winning their heat, and the finalists competed to win another $50,000 for a total grand prize of $60,000. The winner of this tournament was Sophina Uong.[8] </p>
<p> During Season 19, Chopped held a 5-part "Tournament Of Stars". It was identical in format to the "All Stars" Tournaments, with 16 celebrities competing to win $50,000 for charity. The contestants were divided into 4 categorical groups for the first 4 episodes(sports stars, Rachael Vs. Guy finalists, comedians, and actors respectively). The winner was Michael Imperioli who donated his winnings to the Pure Land Project, an organization which helps build and maintain schools in rural Tibet. </p>
<p> During Season 21, a 5-part "Ultimate Champions" Tournament was held, featuring 16 returning champions (12 amateurs and 4 professional chefs) competing to win $50,000, plus a new car of the winners choice from Buick. Like most celebrity tournaments, the returning champions were divided into 4 categorical groups for the 1st 4 episodes(professionals, amateur champs, heroes, and celebrities respectively). The winner was Diana Sabater. The finale of this tournament also marked the 1st time that both civilian and celebrity contestants competed in the same episode. </p>
<p> In the fall of 2015, Chopped aired a four-part "Chopped: Impossible" Tournament in which 12 former champions were invited back to compete for a grand prize of up to $40,000. Each basket contained ingredient combinations that were specifically chosen to be more difficult than usual. Four chefs competed in each of three preliminary heats, with Restaurant: Impossible host Robert Irvine as one of the three judges. The winners advanced to a two-round finale (Appetizer and Entree), in which Irvine observed their cooking but did not serve as a judge. The winner of the finale received $15,000 and competed directly against Irvine in a "Wild Card Entree" round; if the chef's dish was judged superior to Irvine's, he/she won an additional $25,000. </p>
<p> Three 5-part Teen Tournaments have been held to date, in seasons 21, 25 and 29, following the same structure as other tournaments. Four teen chefs competed in each preliminary heat, with the winners advancing to the finale. Prizes were awarded in the finale as follows: </p>
<p> Season 21: $25,000 cash and a $40,000 culinary school scholarship for the winner; $1,000 FoodNetwork.com gift certificate for each of the other finalists </p>
<p> Seasons 25 and 29: $25,000 cash for the winner; $1,000 FoodNetwork.com gift certificate and a show-branded chef's jacket for each of the other finalists </p>
<p> Chopped After Hours is a spin-off series that premiered on September 15, 2015 and airs at 11 p.m. ET on Tuesdays. Episodes consist of three segments, each featuring judges from a different Chopped episode as they prepare dishes using one of the mystery ingredient baskets given to the original contestants.[9] The second season premiered on July 5, 2016.[10] </p>
<p> In season 33, Chopped will be holding a tournament consisting of 16 celebrities divided into four categories: internet celebrities, athletes, comedians, and TV and film stars, with a grand prize of $50,000 for charity. The event began on March 28, 2017.[11] </p>
<p> On September 5, 2019, it was announced that a five-episode stunt titled Chopped: Sweets Showdown will premiere on October 1, 2019.[12] </p>
<p> Chopped Amateurs features contestants who do not have professional training or schooling; most are self-taught. Celebrity episodes: four celebrities competing for charity. Some episodes have featured teens or children competing. Occasionally the prize is a scholarship to a culinary school. Losing contestants on these episodes often receive a consolation prize, typically a $1,000 shopping spree on foodnetwork.com. On one occurrence the prize was a $40,000 scholarship, the runner-up received a $20,000 scholarship while the other two contestants each received a $5,000 scholarship. Holiday themed episodes have also occurred featuring holiday inspired ingredients (such as a chocolate Santa on a Christmas episode or candy blood on a halloween show) and the contestants are asked to prepare holiday themed dishes. There were also several themed episodes with non-holiday themes. These themes were based on either themed ingredients (e.g. spicy foods), world cuisines (e.g. Italian, Australian, New Orleans), chefs with the same background (notably, redemption episodes featuring former contestants that got "chopped" in their first appearances), or a combination. </p>
<p> Former contestants competing in other reality shows[edit] </p>
<p> Some of the contestants on Chopped would go on to appear in Fox's reality show Hell's Kitchen. William Lustberg, the runner up on the ninth episode of the first season, was the runner up on season 9 of Hell's Kitchen. Roshni Mansukhani, the winner of the fourth episode of the second season, was eliminated in the eighth episode of the tenth season of Hell's Kitchen. Jackie Baldassari, who was eliminated after the entrée in the tenth episode of the ninth season of Chopped, was eliminated in the ninth episode of the eleventh season of Hell's Kitchen. Anthony "Anton" Testino, who was eliminated after the appetizer in the tenth episode of the fifth season, was eliminated in the fourteenth episode of the twelfth season of Hell's Kitchen. Robyn Almodovar, the winner of the sixth episode of the twenty-fourth season, had previously been eliminated in the sixteenth episode of the tenth season of Hell's Kitchen and was later eliminated in thirteenth episode of the seventeenth season of Hell's Kitchen. Finally, Hassan Musselmani, who was eliminated after the dessert in the third episode of the 35th season of Chopped, had previously been eliminated in the seventh episode of the fifteenth season of Hell's Kitchen. In addition, Frank Bilotti, who was eliminated after the entrée in the third episode of the 37th season, had previously been eliminated in the tenth episode of the thirteenth season of Hell's Kitchen. Some former contestants and judges from Chopped have also appeared on Beat Bobby Flay, as well as several former contestants appearing on another Food Network series Cutthroat Kitchen.[13] </p>
<p> A spin-off series titled Chopped Sweets premiered on February 3, 2020, with Scott Conant as host. It follows the same three-round competition/judging structure and $10,000 prize as the original, but chefs are required to make a differently-themed dessert in every round. </p>
<p> Beginning on January 2, 2014, Food Network also aired a Canadian version of Chopped called Chopped Canada, which features Canadian contestants and judges. That adaptation was originally hosted by Canadian-born actor Dean McDermott for the first two seasons, and is now hosted by former CFL wide receiver Brad Smith. The rules are identical to the US counterpart as is the $10,000 prize. The show was cancelled on February 11, 2017 and only lasted 4 seasons. </p>
<p> Beginning July 23, 2014, Food Network South Africa began airing a local adaptation of Chopped called Chopped South Africa.[15] </p>

<p> Chop Suey | Classic Chinese-American Recipe Like Mom Made </p>
<p> Chop Suey is a delicious stew composed of bean sprouts, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, onions, celery, and bits of pork, chicken, or beef served with noodles. Popular in the 1950s, each mom had her own version of this cheap, familiar comfort food. This recipe is like the one my mother-in-law, Helen made. </p>
<p> The True Chop Suey History </p>
<p> Exactly what does chop suey mean? In Chinese, the two characters for chop suey are “shap sui,” which means “mixed small bits or odds and ends.” </p>
<p> Although nobody knows for sure, San Francisco seems to be the city that gave birth to this mixed stew. </p>
<p> It was there that Chinese laborers flooded the city to take advantage of the booming economy brought on by the Gold Rush. </p>
<p> Chinese restaurants popped up everywhere. </p>
<p> The legend goes that one night a group of drunken miners stumbled into a Chinese restaurant and demanded food. The tired owner trudged back into the kitchen, scraped leftover food off of the precious customers’ plates, then put the scraps onto new ones. </p>
<p> He doused the jumble of meat and vegetables in soy sauce and then presented the food to the inebriated clients. </p>
<p> The miners loved the dish! The following night they returned and demanded more chop suey. </p>
<p> Chop Suey Spreads Across the Country </p>
<p> By the 1920s, the Chinese-American stew was as popular as hot dogs. The Chinese restaurants opened eateries throughout the country and adapted the stew to the tastes of non-Chinese customers. </p>
<p> The dish was cheap and easy to make. In the 1950s, mothers were making this Chinese stew for their families. A big pot fed an entire family. </p>
<p> Chop suey was now a hallmark of adventurous ethnic eating. Canned chop suey and packaged varieties appeared on the scene. </p>
<p> With the appearance of influential figures like Julia Child, James Beard, and Craig Claiborne, customers began to search for authenticity in food. They wanted dishes like Gnocchi in Brodo and Pugliese Bread. </p>
<p> So in the 1960s, the so-called Chinese dish lost favor for unique dishes such as Peking duck and potstickers. </p>
<p> Today if you go into a Chinese restaurant you’ll see dishes such as Kung Pao shrimp or chicken with broccoli, hot and sour soup. You won’t find “shap sui” on the menu. </p>
<p> Chop Suey Revisited </p>
<p> One of the problems of the old Chinese-American stew was that everything was overcooked. </p>
<p> The vegetables were mushy and the liquid sometimes gelatinous. But that does not have to be the case. </p>
<p> I remember the first time I had chop suey. </p>
<p> Helen, my mother-in-law, had to cook dinner early because it was her turn to host Bunko and a group of ladies was descending on the house. </p>
<p> Everyone had to eat early and leave the ladies to their game. </p>
<p> This recipe is very tasty. Instead of using leftovers, like they did years ago, we use fresh ingredients. </p>
<p> Add the type of veggies you love. You can’t go wrong. Give it a try, we’re sure you won’t be disappointed! </p>
<p> Tutti a tavola è pronto! </p>
<p> Un caro saluto e alla prossima. </p>
<p> Chop Suey | Traditional Chinese-American Recipe Like Mom Made </p>
<p> A delicious Chinese-American recipe that utilizes whichever meat you prefer along with bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, onions, and celery. Add more vegetables if you wish. </p>
<p> 2 Tablespoons cornstarch </p>
<p> 4 Tablespoons water </p>
<p> 4 oz. Canton noodles cooked according to directions. Set aside. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in large skillet over medium heat and add the pork cubes. Cook, stirring, until the pork begins to brown, 10 minutes. Remove the meat from the skillet and set aside. </p>
<p> Heat the remaining oil in the skillet and add the onion, celery, and red pepper flakes. Sauté for about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue to sauté until the mushrooms release some of their liquid about another 3 minutes. </p>
<p> Stir in the bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and chicken broth. Let it come to a simmer. Add the meat back in with the soy sauce and cover the skillet. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> In a small bowl or measuring cup combine the cold water with the cornstarch. Stir the slurry into the skillet mixture. Cook for about 5 minutes or until thickened. </p>
<p> Add the canton noodles to the shop suey and stir until thoroughly combined. </p>
<p> Serve the chop suey with chopped cilantro, green onions, or sesame seed </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> This is virtually a basic recipe you can add as many vegetables as you want. The meat is up to you -- pork, beef, or chicken. </p>

<p> Comments </p>
<p> I went looking the other day for somewhere to get chop suey. There aren’t any. So I looked online. </p>
<p> A bit of backstory: I used to make a “grand” Chinese dinner every year for Chinese New Year, based on several recipes in a giveaway folder I got a lo-o-o-o-ong time ago from a local grocery. It included chop suey. But the recipe called for the package of fresh “Chop Suey Vegetables” that used to be available in every produce section. When that finally became unavailable, I stopped making the dinner (there were other factors as well, but anyway . . ) </p>
<p> As you can see, I found your site. And I am really looking forward to trying your recipe. Like many others, I will be using fresh beansprouts (I just can’t stomach the soggy canned ones any more). </p>
<p> A couple of commenters mention molasses as an addition. I never used it in the chop suey, but the recipe for the gravy for the foo yong that also came from the aforementioned folder calls for a product called Bead Molasses. It used to be available in the Asian section of the regular grocery, but now I have to go to the Asian big grocery to get it. </p>
<p> Hi Lynne! Thank you for sharing your story!! When we first wanted to duplicate my MIL’s Chop Suey (she used canned bean sprouts) we searched for fresh bean sprouts. We went to our local Kroger, which is huge I might add with lots of International foods because it is a college town. Anyway when we asked about the bean sprouts they said they’d stopped carrying the fresh. Too many people were getting sick from them so we stuck with the canned. I’m sure the fresh would give it another flavor. Anyway, to err on the side of caution we stuck with the canned variety. Let me know how your Chop Suey turns out and what you did. I’m always for tweaking a recipe. Have a great weekend. xoxo </p>
<p> This recipe is identical to the Chop Suey that my mother made for me in Houston, Texas nearly 70 years ago. I made it for my dinner tonight. My mother used thinly sliced pork and I used chicken. Only thing that’s changed is that I live in Australia now. This recipe is truly excellent. Don’t change a thing!! </p>
<p> Hello, Earl!! Molto Grazie for your sweet comment. The beauty of the chop suey is that you use what you have. Helen, my dear Mother-in-Law was a treasure. She introduced me to many recipes I had never tasted before. Please stay in touch — I love hearing from my friends. </p>
<p> Excellent recipe with chicken. I also used this recipe with beef. The only difference is that I added a tsp dark sesame oil and tbs molasses mixed with just a dash or two of soy sauce to loosen it </p>
<p> Hi, Bob! I’m so glad you like the recipe and thank you for that tip. I do like dark sesame oil, it has so much flavor. And we always have molasses on hand – I’ll give that a try. Have a wonderful weekend. </p>
<p> Hi, Denise! Thank you for getting back to us — I’m go glad you like the chop suey. I’ll have to look for those ramen noodles. xoxo. </p>
<p> Hi Marissa, I was born in San Francisco, but didn’t start eating Chinese food until 1961, when we lived in Marin County. A restaurant in Larkspur, called Chinese Kitchen, was an absolute joy for a young boy as chef’s worked behind a glass wall and threw food in the air from giant flaming woks. The result was super yummy and I loved all the favorites like BBQ Pork, Sweet/Sour Pork, Fried Rice and my favorite Chop Suey. Having spent many years traveling in Asia, I’ve been offered the finest in Chinese cuisine from Beijing to Shanghai to Hunan to Canton. A well made Chop Suey still remains a favorite as it combines a large amount of veggies, a bit of protein and a small amount of ‘good carbs’…kind of perfect and you can tweak the formula you’ve laid out here from All Canned to Locavore Prime….even go fancy schmancy if so inclined…truffles, aged Sherry? Thanks for a great recipe! </p>
<p> Hello, Paul!! Thank you so much for your great story. Our fantastic food memories are wonderful, aren’t they? I wish I could have seen some of the places you’ve been too. Love to hear from you again. </p>
<p> Thank you for improving my favorite childhood meal! The fresh ingredients were a big improvement! I used low sodium ingredients. I added carrots and omitted the red pepper flakes I seasoned it with Webers sodium free chicken seasoning. The flavor was awesome! </p>
<p> Thank you for your nice comment, Lisa! We do love our improved Chop Suey. Happy New Year! </p>
<p> Hello, Julie! About six people unless you have huge appetites and then you may get less. But six is a good sized portion. </p>
<p> Hi Marissa! This looks great! I was wondering if I could serve over rice instead of the noodles? Will there be enough sauce for that? Thank you! </p>
<p> Yes, Jennifer, there should be enough sauce. If you want more sauce, add a little broth and a bit more seasoning. You can’t hurt the recipe — it is sooooo forgiving and it’s delicious. </p>
<p> I love reading posts, that explain meaning and history of great recipes. I tried so many variations of this recipe and cant wait to try yours! </p>
<p> I love that you included the history of this famous classic dish. Very interesting. I am going to try and make it w/ tofu, since I’m vegan. I think it will be fabulous! </p>
<p> I love the story of a piece of the Americanf food history that you tell us in your post. This dish is more inviting after I read your post! Thanks! </p>
<p> This looks delicious and it reminds me of my mother- she made Chop Suey all the time and it was one of our favorites. </p>
<p> We loooove Asian food in our family and chop suey is one of our favorite family dinner recipe. I’d love to try your version of chop suey. It looks great. </p>
<p> Oh, I love quick and easy. Stir-frys and chop-suey are definitely top on the list of quick and delicious. Can’t wait to try this Marisa. So yum. </p>
<p> We are Asian food fanatics at home. Although we eat Asian food often, we have not tried the chop suey. The dish looks great. </p>
<p> It’s a good thing they didn’t translate the name chop suey, because I don’t see “odds & ends” being a good marketing ploy for a recipe!! I love Chinese food, and I’ve seen Chop Suey on menus, but I’ve never had it before. This looks really delicious </p>
<p> This dish looks great. Gotta love a dish you can use whatever’s in the fridge too. My husband will love it when I make it for him. He grew up in Japan so he’s used to all kinds of traditional Asian dishes. </p>
<p> Wow! Thanks for sharing, my husband loves it so much. Can’t wait to cook this for my in-laws. I’m pretty sure they are going to love it too </p>
<p> Hi, Barbara! No, it won’t make it too salty. There are plenty of veggies plus liquid in there. Plus you serve it over rice or whatever you want. It’s really VERY good. </p>
<p> Love this recipe, Marisa. Sounds so delicious. I love how simple and easy this is too. My kids love Asian food and I love it more because it reminds me of my childhood. </p>
<p> I had no idea the back story behind this dish. My mother used to make something similar but it was AWFUL! lol. Overcooked veggies and all. She’s gotten better, thankfully! </p>
<p> I hate to admit this, but I had NO idea what Chop Suey was. I have heard it used as slang in movies hahahaha. I guess I didn’t even get that joke. But, now reading this recipe and all of it’s ingredients, I actually think I’m going to love this – will have to try!!! </p>
<p> An interesting combination of ingredients, and incredibly beautiful presentation and I’m sure the taste of this recipe is unsurpassed! Of course I want to try your cool recipe. Thank you! </p>
<p> A great idea for a easy dinner for my family. This recipe looks super easy and full of ingredients my family loves. Looking forward to trying soon. </p>
<p> you amaze me on all the different cuisines you know how to make and so authentic! My family is pretty boring they like two kinds of food, meat, Italian and sometimes and rare Mexican food and I have to make it without onions and almost everyone adds them. Thats it .. I am allergic to onions so I rarely can eat anywhere outside of our home. This sounds wonderful I have never had anything like it </p>
<p> That is simple to produce and a very healthful and delectable recipe to build this at home, Last time I visited that website for make the fantastic rice recipe. </p>
<p> I love learning about the history of chop suey, and how people have adapted it to their own times and circumstances! Isn’t that the foundation of all great family cooking? Thanks for including so much great information! </p>
<p> This sounds super tasty and super easy to make. It makes perfect family dinner for busy weekdays. I love the addition of sprouts and bamboo. Such a great flavors in one bowl. </p>
<p> Gorgeous dish and so quick and easy to make. I love that you shared the history and show how easy this is to make instead of ordering take out. Perfect quick meal for ANY night! </p>
<p> I love Chop Suey, but I don’t have a good recipe of my own. Your recipe looks so tasty! I’m going to have to give your recipe a try. I’m sure it will be the answer to my Chop Suey recipe problem! </p>
<p> I’ve actually never made Chop Suey before. This gives me the perfect reason to do so! </p>
<p> Such a great post about Chop Suey. Which I’ve never made. Sounds absolutely delicious and will definitely be trying. </p>
<p> Hi, Jessica! It really tastes great. I’m thankful to my MIL for introducing me to it. </p>
<p> I really enjoyed your chop suey post! I knew it was more of a North American Chinese dish but had no idea it’s been around for that long! My mother also made a very overcooked Chop Suey for the duration of my childhood as was her custom. </p>
<p> Hello, Bernice! My mom and dad believed in overcooked veggies. That’s just the way it was done. But!!! It was delicious! </p>
<p> This looks so comforting and delicious! Love the simple ingredients and how quickly this comes together. Such a good substitute to take out. </p>
<p> This looks fabulous! I’ve decided to stop going out to eat Chinese because it always makes me feel sick. The only other option is to make it at home so this recipe is getting saved! </p>
<p> Love your back story on this classic dish that I’m sure everyone grew up with. Yours looks so good. </p>
<p> Thank you, Sharon! I would have never known about it if it hadn’t been for my sweet MIL. </p>
<p> What a great read! I haven’t had homemade chop suey in forever!! My mom used to make it all the time! Your recipe looks so fabulous that I want to make it asap! </p>
<p> Sorry, but just no. Chop suey does NOT contain noodles and never has. You do have a delicious-looking chow mein there, however. </p>
<p> Hi, Christina! Well, since Chop Suey is pretty much an anything you want to add dish we made it this way — as my sweet MIL used to make. How do you make it, I’d love to know? There are so many variations out there I’m always anxious to try more. </p>
<p> I’ve made this dish for the past 57 years or eaten it. My mom made it when I was a kid, we always uses beef. You can buy it in a can now But we always put it over rice. I’m adding baby corn, and boc choy this time for a change. I always cook it in a crock pot my mom used a dutch oven. I’ll add the boc choy after its cooked because I’m not sure what that will do. My sause will be molassis and soy sause with corn starch. I like it cooked a long time to break down the meat I’m using stew meat cubs. I have to take it ez on adding green veggies but I’ll add them to plate it after its cooked and let the hot stuff cook the fresh veggies I might even add carrots and I’m going to try some ginger at the start. </p>
<p> This is a meal you can tweak and play with and add different flavors but we have always loved it. Ill have to try it with different meats sometime. I may add some spices and garlic but not use onions. My wife dosnt like the gas I’ll get sweet from the molasses. </p>
<p> Hi, Bob! Thank you for your informative comment. It is interesting how the whole Chop Suey came about. I guess it’s what’s in the fridge. I don’t believe you can ruin it — just add what you like. I wish I could see a photo of your Chop Suey — I bet it’s colorful. </p>
<p> I remember this dish from my childhood as well and enjoyed reading the history of the dish here in the U.S. I think my dad made it using leftover roast beef that he cubed up and celery and onion, but I couldn’t remember what other ingredients. So glad I found this recipe. We had it served over rice as well. Loved the memory of it! Can’t wait to try this recipe! </p>
<p> Hi, Pam!! I remember eating this dish at my sweet Mother-in_law’s kitchen. She is the one who introduced me to it. Hope you’re having a great summer. </p>
<p> You know, I never knew what chop suey meant or it’s history until reading this post. So interesting! Thanks for sharing. I have a few pork tenderloins in the freezer and may just have to use them in this recipe. </p>
<p> Hi, Jessica! If you like extra veggies — add them. The beauty of the recipe is that you can make it however you like. xoxo </p>
<p> It’s a great way to use pork tenderloin, Jessica! It stretches the meat so it feeds a lot of people. My sweet MIL had seven kids plus she and her hubby making 9. Lots of hungry mouths. </p>
<p> Funny story about miners, I was laughing just thinking about how our world is full of coincidences! I am from San Francisco and you right, never seen this dish in any Chinese restaurant:) </p>
<p> Hi, Tatiana! I love some of the stories behind the recipes. This one made me chuckle too. I never knew the history even though I’d eaten the dish several times at my mother-in-law’s house. </p>
<p> I love making Asian dishes at home! I’ve never tried to make chop suey, will have to add this one to my list </p>
<p> I eat chop suey so infrequently that I forgot how much I like it – I need to make this soon! </p>
<p> Hi, Leslie! Now that we have more fresh oriental vegetables available we can make it fresher but keep the flavor. Have a good weekend. </p>
<p> Talk about instant flash back to my childhood….I can remember walking in the back door of my house and smelling the aroma of a big pot of chop suey simmering on the stove…..Mom would prepare it early morning and as always, ready for 5:00pm dinner that night. Thanks, for the recipe and memories. </p>
<p> Hi, Susie! It was at your house where I first tasted Chop Suey. We made it at our house later on but then forgot about it. I’m so glad we made it again. It brought back such great memories. Your mom was the greatest!!Love and hugs!!! </p>
<p> LOL – I read “Chinese-American like Mom made” and flashed to a Chinese-American friend talking about her mom making hot dog fried rice, and serving it with ketchup, to be American! Early fusion food, before that was a trendy concept… (And not always at its most successful – but it all paved the way for more adventurous palates.) </p>
<p> I’ll use fresh bean sprouts – they’re crunchier and taste better – but I can get them at the Korean greengrocer across the street. Not everyone can. (I certainly remember eating the canned ones when I was a kid…) And the fresh celery and onion are an improvement over the canned and soggy “Chinese Vegetables” we used… </p>
<p> And I certainly remember the package of fried Chop Suey Noodles, you mention in a comment! They were the best part! LOL (Yeah, I’ll use better noodles…) </p>
<p> Hi, Anne! That’s funny. Years ago we did some crazy combinations. I’d never heard of Chop Suey until I ate my MIL’s. She was the sweetest person. I would love to ask her how a !00% German came across a Chinese-American dish. Love the recipes that bring back good memories. Have a great weekend. </p>
<p> I keep coming back to the recipe Marisa. It reminds me so much of my childhood. Can’t wait to try this recipe soon. Love the mushrooms and bamboo shoots in there. I love quick these recipes get ready. Perfect for buys week nights. </p>
<p> Hi, Veena! With your busy family, I’m sure you need quick and easy but good tasting!! We are especially fond of mushrooms in most of our dishes. Enjoy! </p>
<p> This would be so amazing for dinner tonight! I think that my hubs would especially love it. So yummy! </p>
<p> Always so fun to see an updated version of an old family recipe! This would make a great weeknight dinner! </p>
<p> Hi, Kathryn! Yes, it would be great on a weeknight. In fact, how about sprinkling some chow mein noodles on top and give it an extra crunch? </p>
<p> I remember having this as a kid in the Chinese restaurant! Brings back memories:) </p>
<p> My mother used to fix chop suey in the 50’s snd 60’s. I really hadn’t thought about it in years. Thanks for bringing back some lovely memories. I will have to make this soon, and start a “new” old tradition in my family….. .. </p>
<p> Ciao Diane! Sometimes those old recipes need to be revived. Hope you are enjoying Fall! Do you still have any veggies on the vine? Un abbraccio forte! </p>
<p> Still have tomatoes snd cucumbers growing! Most of my cherry tomato plants have withered and I removed them. Reg. tomatoes still okay…I know it won’t last long tho..first frost is coming soon! How’s the fishing this year? </p>
<p> Ba ha ha – we ARE in sync!!! And it’s funny, I had a reader asking me for Chop Suey, let me see if I can find the message and I’ll send this to them! </p>
<p> Hi Nagi!! I still say we were separated at birth, somehow!! Next time I’m adding broccoli to the Chop Suey! Big hugs! ???? </p>
<p> This looks like the perfect dinner, and I would love to eat this tonight. Homemade is always so much better. Leftovers would be amazing….and this is perfect for feed a hungry. A few egg rolls and we are good to go. Esy enough to make on a busy weeknight….and economical too!! Perfect for comfort food season. </p>
<p> I agree with you, Gloria. We do like our egg rolls, too. Don’t forget the wine! ???? </p>
<p> I love reading about food and this was an awesome right up. I agree that chop suey was an easy quick to make dish, cause I always remember my mom would make it when she’s pressed for time. It was one of our favorite dishes. Yours reminds me of hers.. same color and those mushrooms. I love mushrooms. Saving for later. </p>
<p> Hi Veena! It is a great dish for busy moms. I also like the ability to add whatever you want. It’s always easy to have the bean sprouts, water chestnuts, and bamboo shoots on hand. Have a great day. xoxo </p>
<p> in Nepal, we have a different interpretation of chop suey, it has more crispy noodles but the concept is very similar and i have always loved it. your version looks delicious! </p>
<p> Thank you, Dixya! We have Chow Mein noodles here that are canned and they are crispy. It would make a great crunchy topping for this recipe. I love bringing back old standards — like a song it brings back memories. </p>
<p> I heard a different story about the origin of Chop Suey, but my story isn’t as interesting. I love chop suey, and I particularly like that you can pretty much use anything in it. I love this recipe because it uses canned bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts. These are some of my favorite additions to my homemade Chinese recipes, but they seem to be falling from vogue. I prefer the retro or vintage style Chinese dishes. I’ve pinned this recipe so I can make it for my family. </p>
<p> Hi Patti! Thank you for pinning! This recipe brings back such sweet memories of my mother-in-law. Where she got the recipe I don’t know. There weren’t any Chinese restaurants in the small town where they lived. I’m sure you’ll family will enjoy! xoxo </p>
<p> What a yummy dish. Looks great Marisa. A filling one dish meal with lots of delicious texture. Love the stories attached. </p>
<p> Thank you, Jovina! I think some of those old dishes need to be revived, don’t you? Of course putting a bit of a modern touch to it. </p>

<p> Classic British recipes </p>
<p> Classic British info </p>
<p> This collection seeks to celebrate the best of British ingredients and cooking from some of the greatest chefs this country has to offer. </p>
<p> A lot of classic British dishes are unashamedly hearty - who minds our famously bad weather when you can tuck into Dominic Chapman’s Beef stew, or Josh Eggleton's wonderful Fish and chips to warm you up. If you are seeking ideas for a proper Sunday roast, have a look at Galton Blackiston's Yorkshire pudding recipe and Martin Wishart's Roast chicken with vegetables, sage and cider. </p>
<p> No Sunday lunch is complete without a proper pudding, and this collection is full of fantastic British desserts. Shaun Rankin’s Treacle tart recipe offers a slice of nostalgia, while Galton Blackiston’s easy Sticky toffee pudding recipe is British stodge at its best. For a lighter dessert try Geoffrey Smeddle's Eton mess or James MacKenzie’s take on the classic Bakewell tart. </p>
<p> British cuisine, much like our culture, is magpie like and takes on influences from a wealth of other cultures. There are some fantastic Anglo-Indian dishes in this collection, such as Josh Eggleton’s vibrant Piccalilli recipe and Alfred Prasad’s delicious Vegetarian kedgeree. </p>

<p> 10 Classic Italian Pork Dishes </p>
<p> Author of "The Better-Than-Takeout Thai Cookbook," Danette St. Onge is a food and travel writer with expertise in a variety of cuisines including Italian. </p>
<p> Pork is a common meat in Italian regional cuisine. Every city, town, and region in Italy has its specialties. Some of these specialty dishes have become classics that you will find in Italian communities scattered across the globe. Use this list as both a primer for what Italian pork dishes you could make at home or a buying guide for your next visit to an Italian deli, butcher, or regional restaurant. </p>
<p> Tuscan Pork Loin Cooked in Milk (Arista al Latte) </p>
<p> This Tuscan recipe is a wonderful, lemony way to prepare pork loin that can also be done ahead. The name Arista is used for roast pork in Tuscany, stemming from an ecumenical council with the Greek Orthodox Church. </p>
<p> Neapolitan Pork Rotolini (Braciole di Maiale) </p>
<p> This is a traditional Neapolitan recipe for pork braciole (slice of pork) rolled up around a filling with cheese, prosciutto, raisins, and pine nuts. It's an elegant dish to serve for dinner with a glass of red wine. </p>
<p> Cassoeula </p>
<p> This hearty Milanese soup features pork, sausage, and cabbage. Try making it (or ordering it in a restaurant) for those who appreciate snout-to-tail cuisine as it uses a pig's trotter and a pig's ear in addition to ribs and pork rind. That may be a little too classic for some people. </p>
<p> Roast Suckling Pig (Maialino allo Spiedo) </p>
<p> Every region of Italy has its own recipe for roasting suckling pig. Fire, piglet, and time equal true classic Italian cuisine. </p>
<p> Salumi </p>
<p> Pork is the base of most Italian cold cuts, which are collectively called salumi. Traditionally, hogs were butchered in the fall and these cured meats would be stable throughout the winter. Learn about the different types found in regions of Italy, including prosciutto, salami, sausages, and pancetta. </p>
<p> Tuscan Salami (Salame Toscano) </p>
<p> You can make this Tuscan cold cut from a recipe drawn from a 1772 manuscript. It's seasoned with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and garlic. You'll need a cool place to cure it for four to nine months. </p>
<p> Tuscan Finocchiona Salami </p>
<p> This fennel flavored salami can be made at home. You'll need time, since the recipe calls for the salami to be aged for four months. </p>
<p> Tuscan Pork Stew (Spezzatino di Maiale) </p>
<p> This classic stew uses cubed lean pork, tomato sauce, and cannellini or cranberry beans. Perfect to warm up a cold Italian night. </p>
<p> Tuscan-Style Roast Pig (Porchetta) </p>
<p> Roast pig is an ideal picnic food and also quite good as part of a festive meal (although not tremendously elegant). This recipe uses a small pig. At fairs, larger pigs are roasted and sliced to stuff sandwiches. It's common street food in central Italy. </p>
<p> Tuscan Sausage: La Salsiccia di Lucca </p>
<p> These sausages can be made and used fresh or you can age them for three to four days in a cool spot. The result is a mild sausage that is delicious grilled and you can also use them in a soup. </p>

<p> An impassioned Italian Scot sharing how to cook authentically, and travel with enthusiasm. </p>
<p> A Collection of Authentic Italian Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Recipes </p>
<p> This collection of authentic Italian Christmas Eve and Christmas Day recipes will help you to plan a holiday just like Nonna. </p>
<p> Originally published December 16, 2016. </p>
<p> The following Italian dishes are the types of food my southern Italian family (some of whom are now all over the globe) makes at Christmastime, both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. </p>
<p> They may not be exactly the same as other southern Italian families’ recipes, but I can assure you one thing: they are authentic. Nonna taught my mother how to make most of these recipes, and my mother taught me. I hope you enjoy them and find something to add to your Christmastime menu. Maybe you can even introduce some dishes to start an Italian tradition in your own home. Buon Natale! </p>
<p> Click on the photos for the recipe. </p>
<p> Italian Christmas Eve Dishes </p>
<p> As is the tradition in Italy, the Christmas Eve meal consists mainly of seafood and no meat. </p>
<p> No Italian Christmas is complete without this classic Italian bread which is almost like a cake. I’ll keep adding to this post as I publish more authentic recipes for the holidays, so check back every now and then. </p>

<p> So many wonderful treats here, but right now – sitting by the fire – the soup sounds irresistible! </p>
<p> I love when you share all of these delicious looking Italian traditional recipes. Many of them I’ve heard of, some I’ve tried and the rest I need to learn! Thanks for sharing such wonderful recipes for a real Italian Christmas, Christina. </p>

<p> What fun, Christine! I know many of these but am glad for a few new ones to try! Happy Christmas! </p>
<p> Love how you can preserve generations of recipes through your blog. Always happy to see recipes that are family traditions. Thank you for sharing :) </p>
<p> Lovely to see a different side to holiday food, with some delicious looking dishes. </p>
<p> Such a wonderful collection of holiday recipes! So many I want to try, particularly the Pizza Inglese and Chicken Soup with Grattini all Uovo. Beautiful photos </p>
<p> What a great collection! These all look delicious…especially those frittelles, yum!! </p>
<p> Such a delightful collection of Italian dishes! My daughter and I pick something we hadn’t tried before and make it for Christmas – this list gives us so many more intriguing and delightful things to choose from. Merry Christmas to you and your family. </p>
<p> Some of these dishes are similar to Portuguese traditional Christmas dinner, namely the salt cod, and especially the cioffe, which I loved scoffing as a child. Our cioffe -same stripes shape- (in Portugal) were covered in sugar and cinnamon, hmm so delicious, I remember it well now. My mum used to make them. I moved to the UK 25 years ago, and I have not seen them/eaten any since. I never did learn how to make them so, thank you, very much, for sharing this. I shall try your recipe, and attempt to do the cinnamon (Portuguese) variation. Lupini, with or without olives, is also a Portuguese snack, although it is eaten mostly in the Summer (mostly in cafés by the beach), downed with the great Portuguese beer, Sagres. As for the salt cod, yours is also a variation of a Portuguese dish. Salt cod, accompanied with boiled potatoes, cabbage and egg, all drizzled with a good measure of good olive oil, is actually the traditional main Christmas meal in Portugal, well, at least it was, in our home. Doesn’t sound very appetising but, as a child, I used to love mashing the potatoes on my plate, with my fork, and they’d taste so good with the olive oil. Thanks for the lovely memories which your post has brought me. </p>
<p> How lovely to hear of the similarities with Portuguese cooking, Marina! I’ve never been to Portugal, but just got back Tuesday from my very first time in Spain, so I’m getting closer! :) There was SO much salt cod there. </p>
<p> Happy that you found the cioffe recipe. Let me know how they turn out and Merry Christmas! </p>
<p> Good gracious ! It brings me back to my childhood …. It seems that I shall make a major change of plans :-) Thank you for sharing all the beauties ! </p>

<p> Community shares in tradition at annual pan de campo cook off </p>
<p> EDINBURG — The community gathered Saturday at the American Legion Post 408 for the 41st annual pan de campo cook off. </p>
<p> The cook off is a competition in which participants compete in five categories: fajitas, carne guisada, charro beans, pork ribs and, of course, pan de campo. Each category is judged on taste, appearance and tenderness. </p>
<p> For Commander Rene Rodriguez, an Army veteran of the Vietnam War, this is his first time hosting the yearly cook off since being elected commander of the post. </p>
<p> “It brings the community together,” Rodriguez said. “The members and other veterans show up. It’s our major fundraiser. We use it to raise funds for the post. It’s very positive.” </p>
<p> Rodriguez said that his mentor, Dr. Thomas Esparza, was one of the originators of the cook off. The post has a plaque with the names of the members who helped establish the cook off in front of the building. </p>
<p> Pan de campo, officially declared the state bread in 2005, is an old recipe that originated on the ranches of South Texas. The flat bread is traditionally made in a cast iron Dutch oven in a fire pit buried a few feet in the ground. </p>
<p> Dhalia Morin has been making pan de campo for just over 10 years. She said that the process of preparing and making the “cowboy bread” can be time consuming. </p>
<p> “Last night, we got together to make the masa,” Morin explained. “About 10 of us got together, and we were up preparing it until about 11 o’clock at night. Then this morning, at 5:30 in the morning, we had to get up and get over here, bring out the pits, set up the tent and the tables, get the fire started.” </p>
<p> “Yeah it’s a lot of work, but it’s nice because we know we’re doing it for a good cause,” Morin staff. “It’s for the American Legion, and they help the community. We’re just happy to help.” </p>
<p> Gerard Mittelstaedt and his wife Mona have attended the annual cook off for years. Gerard, a retired librarian, said that his interest in pan de campo and the historic aspect of the cook off are what draw him back each year. </p>
<p> “It’s a traditional bread. It’s interesting that it has to be cooked in small batches,” Gerard said. “If you look over the whole world, everybody has a flat bread. There’s flat bread in China, all over the Middle East, and this is our version in South Texas and the ranching community.” </p>
<p> Gerard noted that the number of participants in this year’s cook off (about 17) was noticeably smaller than previous years. Mona attributed that to the strong winds. </p>
<p> “It’s interesting. Like he said, it’s a little thin, but that’s probably due to the wind and the dry conditions that we’ve had,” Mona said. “People are afraid of their tents and things blowing away, I would imagine. It’s nice for people to get together and share this kind of experience. Camp cooking, the way it used to be done a long time ago, is very interesting and its educational for the kids too.” </p>

<p> A Complete Guide to Pork Cuts </p>
<p> An award-winning food writer and cookbook author, Molly Watson has created more than 1,000 recipes focused on local, seasonal ingredients. </p>
<p> You've bought a delicious looking piece of pork, now what is that cut of pork and how do you cook it? Use this complete guide to pork cuts to tell a pork blade chop from a pork loin chop, a shoulder from a butt (tricked you, those are the same!), and how to cook different cuts of pork to their best advantage. </p>
<p> When buying pork, look for firm, pink flesh. Damp meat, pale meat, and soft meat all come from a factory-farmed pig. Consider seeking out pastured pork or organic pork for the best results. </p>
<p> Note: There are endless regional and ethnic variations on how to butcher. Cuts you find may vary in name and specifics. </p>
<p> Pork belly is not, as you may think, the stomach. Rather, it is the flesh that runs on the underside (the belly) of the pig and surrounds the stomach. It is one long cut of meat with plenty of fat worked into the meat, which is why it is prized for curing and turning into bacon or pancetta. It can also be cooked fresh and is often seen on menus as "braised pork belly." Follow suit at home and either cure or braise it. </p>
<p> Several different cuts can be called pork chops. All are great grilled, broiled, or pan-fried. Note that thicker cut pork chops with the bone still attached cook up the juiciest and most flavorful. In descending order of tenderness (and thus expense), specific pork chops cuts are: </p>
<p> Pork loin chops (a.k.a. pork loin end chops, loin pork chops, pork center loin chops). You can identify these by the T-shaped bone on one side of them. </p>
<p> Pork rib chops (a.k.a. pork rib cut chops, rib pork chops, pork chop end cut) </p>
<p> Pork sirloin chops </p>
<p> Pork top loin chops (a.k.a. pork strip chops) are sometimes sold boneless and called pork loin fillets, which can be cooked just like a chop. </p>
<p> Pork shoulder chops, sometimes sold as pork blade chops, are from the blade roast and are fattier and a bit tougher than other "chops." They can still be grilled, broiled, or pan-fried to great effect, especially if marinated or tenderized beforehand, but they can also stand up to longer, slower cooking methods like braising, too. Learn more about pork shoulder here. </p>
<p> When the ribs on a rib roast (see "roasts" below) are "Frenched" (trimmed of meat), this cut becomes a rack of pork. A pork crown roast is two racks of pork tied into a circular crown, in the middle of which stuffing can be cooked. </p>
<p> Pictured here is a range of boneless cuts that may be referred to as boneless chops or cutlets. Pork cutlets are usually lean steaks similar to sirloin chops, but meatier and boneless. Sometimes medallions cut from a pork tenderloin a cutlet. </p>
<p> Cutlets are classically pounded thinner, to make them even more tender, dredged in breadcrumbs, and pan-fried. They are delicious that way, but can also be baked or quickly seared in a pan or on a grill to excellent effect. </p>
<p> Ham is from the top of the pork leg (the bottom is the shank, which can sometimes be a hock, see below). It can be sold fresh, boiled, smoked or cured (as pictured). Prosciutto and jamon serrano, for example, are salt-and-air-cured hams. </p>
<p> Cuts from the pork loin are the leanest and most tender pork cuts. Be careful to avoid overcooking any cut of pork from the loin (they usually have the word "loin" in their name, i.e., tenderloin, loin chop, etc.). The three sections of the pork loin are: </p>
<p> Blade end is closest to the shoulder and tends to be fatty. </p>
<p> Sirloin end is closest to the rump and tends to be bony. </p>
<p> Center portion is, obviously, in the middle and is the leanest, most tender, and, of course, most expensive section of pork. </p>
<p> When sold as whole "roasts," pork loins are usually tied up, as pictured. Are you looking for the long, skinny tenderloin? See below. </p>
<p> Pork back ribs are often called baby back ribs. They are meatier than spare ribs but not as meaty as country-style ribs. </p>
<p> Country-style pork ribs or loin ribs are the meatiest and fattiest of pork ribs but aren't as easy to pick up and eat with your fingers as are the other pork ribs. They come bone-in or, more commonly, boneless. </p>
<p> Pork spare ribs are the least meaty of pork ribs, but popular for the tender-chewy texture (they are the least fatty of pork ribs) they can attain with properly long and slow cooking. </p>
<p> Like pork chops, many cuts get sold as "pork roasts." What binds them together is that they are all cuts that turn out well when baked in the oven. </p>
<p> Pork Blade Roasts (a.k.a. pork rib end roast, pork 7-rib roast, 5-rib roast, rib end pork loin) are fattier than other roasts, but less expensive and with great flavor. If the roast is bone-in, then ask the butcher to crack the backbone between the ribs to make carving easier. </p>
<p> Pork Tenderloins (see below) are popular for roasting because they are lean, moist, and flavorful. </p>
<p> Pork Rib Roasts are called pork center loin roasts or even sold as "pork roast" when the ribs are removed. They are fattier than pork tenderloin but still fairly lean. They are extremely juicy and flavorful. For a juicy roast, cook it with the slab of fat that comes on it still attached, and carve it off after cooking. Steaks cut from a rib roast are pork loin chops or pork rib chops. </p>
<p> Pork Top Loin Roasts are created by the butcher by tying two top loins together with the fat sides out. </p>
<p> Pork Sirloin Roasts (a.k.a. loin pork roast, pork hipbone roast, pork loin end roast) are lean but less expensive than pork tenderloins. They are difficult to carve if they are bone-in, so have your butcher bone, roll, and tie it. </p>
<p> Boston Butts (see below) need long, slow cooking but offer up the tremendous flavor. </p>
<p> As a general rule, bone-in roasts can be cooked as-is, while boneless roasts benefit from being tied up like the one pictured. Use kitchen twine or plain, uncolored cotton string to tie loops around the roast, or ask your butcher to do it for you. </p>
<p> Many—and perhaps most—sausages are traditionally made with pork. Some are fresh and need cooking; others are already cooked or smoked or cured when sold and need heating up or slicing. Learn details about different sausages here. </p>
<p> We may call them pork hocks and shanks, but a pig would call them its shins. They are often smoked and make great additions to pots of soup or beans to add flavor and body to the broth. </p>
<p> Hocks, technically, still have the skin on them, and are usually sold smoked. When the skin is removed they are called shanks, usually sold raw (as pictured) and respond very well to braising. </p>
<p> Here's the thing: pork butt and pork shoulder are both from the shoulder. They are, technically, different cuts, with the butt (a.k.a. Boston shoulder, and many other names with Boston in them) coming from a thicker section of the shoulder with intense marbling that makes it a darling for pulled pork and other barbecue styles and the shoulder (a.k.a. pork blade shoulder or picnic shoulder) usually being the triangular piece that would be attached to the butt. So many styles and regional variations exist in butchery, however, that it's difficult for the average consumer to know exactly where the cut is from. Luckily, both need long, slow cooking and are great barbecued, braised, or used as stew meat, or in making gyro, so you can use them interchangeably. The one pictured here has been aggressively trimmed of its exterior fat, something we would never do since that's where so much of the cut's flavor comes from. </p>
<p> Pork tenderloin (a.k.a. pork tender, pork fillet) are extremely popular. They are also, along with pork loin chops, the most expensive cut of pork. They are lean, tender, and boneless. They are also easy to cook—try them grilled, roasted, or broiled— but also easy to overcook, so pay attention when they're on the fire or in the oven! </p>
<p> Pork tenderloins are sometimes sold with a silverskin, or silvery membrane, still attached. Remove this before cooking, as pictured (or ask your butcher to remove it for you). </p>
<p> Pork fat back, a.k.a. fatback, is, much as it sounds, the fat from the back of a pig. It is "hard fat" that can be chopped and ground (this is compared to the visceral or "soft fat" found in the abdominal cavity). As such, fatback is a key ingredient in sausages to add fat and moisture. Fat back has rather high water content, so adding too much to burgers or meat loaves will cause noticeable shrinkage when cooked. </p>
<p> Lard is simply rendered fat from pork. It can be used the same way any cooking oil or fat is used and is prized for the flavor it adds when used for frying. </p>
<p> Leaf lard is the highest grade of lard (lard is pork fat, the term is usually used to refer to rendered pork fat suitable for cooking). It comes from the visceral, or "soft," fat from around the kidneys and loin of the pig. Pork lard lacks any real pork or meaty flavor, making it an excellent neutral-flavored cooking fat with a high smoking point. Leaf lard is particularly prized by bakers for use in producing moist, flaky pie crusts. </p>
<p> There are plenty more cuts of pork like pork knuckles, trotters and beyond. The knuckles and feet (trotters), for example, both of which need long, slow cooking to break down all the connective tissue that otherwise makes them tough but are then prized for their meaty flavor. </p>
<p> There is also organ meat—pork liver is the key ingredient in many paté recipes—and the head. Meat from the head is cooked and turned into headcheese, a real delicacy. </p>

<p> Keeping or cutting tradition </p>
<p> Updated: 2012-04-05 11:24 </p>
<p> By Xu Lin (China Daily) </p>
<p> Women rinse their long hair in a river in Huangluo Hongyao village, Longsheng county, in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Lu Jianwei / for China Daily </p>
<p> Pan Hongmei, 46, coils her hair around her head. Huo Yan / China Daily </p>
<p> Young Hongyao women wear headscarves before marriage. Huo Yan / China Daily </p>
<p> The Hongyao have kept the tradition of women wearing their hair long, and it seems to have paid off. Xu Lin reports in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. </p>
<p> Fans of Rapunzel may be amazed to find out that she is not only real, but there's more than one of her and they're all Chinese. In Huangluo Hongyao village, deep in the mountains of Longsheng county in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, women are famous for their ancestral tradition of wearing their hair long. </p>
<p> Hongyao refers to ethnic Yao people who wear red (hong) clothes. </p>
<p> There are 82 households, comprising more than 400 villagers, and they share the same surname, Pan. About 80 out of the 120 women have hair that is more than 1.4 meters long. The longest is nearly 2.1 meters. </p>
<p> "Long hair means longevity, wealth and good fortune for Hongyao women. The longer one's hair is, the more fortunate one will be," says Pan Hongmei, 46, a restaurant owner whose hair coils around her head, with a big bun above her forehead. </p>
<p> "When she combs her hair once, her hair will become dark and shiny. She makes up her face and dresses gaudily for her lover. When she combs her hair twice, her hair becomes thick and shiny. She and her husband will love each other forever," Pan sings, quoting the lyrics from the traditional Long Hair Song. </p>
<p> When a Hongyao girl reaches 18, she usually has an ear-length haircut, keeps the cut hair and adds it when she coils her hair later. This is the only time Hongyao women are allowed to cut their hair. They also collect hair that falls out and add it to their hair when they give birth. </p>
<p> Before marriage, they wear a headscarf because, traditionally, only the bridegrooms can see their hair. Married women don't wear scarves and have a different coiled hairstyle after having a child. They usually put a wooden or silver comb on the top of their hair, so that they can comb whenever they want. </p>
<p> "It takes us two or three minutes to coil our hair without any hairpins. We use hair to tie up our hair, turning it around our heads two or three times to make a bun. When I had to change my hairstyle after giving birth, I spent several days at home learning the new hairstyle," Pan says. </p>
<p> "I wash my 1.5-meter-long hair every three days and rarely use a hair dryer because it dries out. The secret to keep one's hair dark and clean is to wash with the water used to clean rice. It's a natural shampoo and hair conditioner." </p>
<p> Like other female villagers, she stores the water in a pot and boils it before washing her hair so the water ferments. </p>
<p> She then rinses her hair with spring waters "which is cool in summer and warm in winter." Then she wrings it and puts it up on her head to dry. </p>
<p> "My long hair is always noticed when I go outside the village," 27-year-old Pan Yongyan says. "It's inconvenient when I take the train or bus, because it's uncomfortable to sit for a long time with the big bun and inconvenient to comb my hair when I wake up on a sleeper berth." </p>
<p> She works in the village's singing and dancing performance group and displays her long hair for tourists, earning about 2,000 yuan ($318) a month in the peak season of tourism and 1,000 yuan in the off-season. She performs six or seven 40-minute shows per day at most. </p>
<p> In January 2009, she went to Beijing to become an assistant to actress Huang Shengyi for four months. There, she used shampoo to wash her hair. She had to get up early or go to bed late to wash and dry it. </p>
<p> "I felt like a stranger in the city and was lonely. The pace of life there was too fast," she says. </p>
<p> She says she prefers to be at home because she can be with her family and the money she earned in Beijing is about the same as she earns in her village. </p>
<p> "When I was a kid, I was depressed about my long hair because my classmates would discuss it all the time. But I started to cherish it gradually," she says. </p>
<p> Besides performing, she also waitresses in her family's restaurant, does housework and makes embroidery. </p>
<p> "It takes three years to embroider a Yao-style outfit. It's for my dowry, and my mother helps do the needlework," Pan Yongyan says. </p>
<p> "The tourism boom has changed our lives greatly. We used to sing a folk song saying that Huangluo was the poorest village, but now we are living a pretty good life." </p>
<p> They live in diaojiaolou, houses typical of several Chinese ethnic groups, including the Dong and Miao. They keep cattle and pigs on the first floor, live on the second floor and store goods on the third floor. </p>
<p> Pan Hongmei says these days, however, for hygiene reasons, domestic animals are kept in another building. </p>
<p> "Some people build brick buildings, but I prefer wooden diaojiaolou because I want my offspring to inherit our traditions. My 4-month-old granddaughter will wear her hair long, too." </p>

<p> I seem to remember my grandmother cutting up raw italian sweet and hot sausages and throwing them in a pot of bubbling marinara sauce but am not sure if this is ok to do. Should I cook the sausage first and then cut them and add them to the sauce or can I throw them in raw and cook for a few hours in sauce?? Thanks! </p>

<p> A Chef's Review Of The Top Name Brand Cooking Pans </p>
<p> Chef Randy Feltis joined us to test different types of non-stick frying pans to see which one offers the best value! We tested them by frying an egg in the pan with no oil to see whether or not it would stick. We put 5 pans to the test, ranging from $1-$120. Remember, the heavier the pan, the better. And caring for your pan is essential. You don’t wanna use anything metal against your non-stick pan such as a spatula or a whisk. Clean with a soft sponge, nothing abrasive, and store them with paper towels in-between so you don’t scratch them. </p>
<p> Dollar Store Pan: ($4.00) Egg got really stuck! </p>
<p> Gotham Steel Frying Pan ($26.99) Steel handles are good for putting food into the oven. No egg was stuck to the pan! </p>
<p> T-Fal Heatmaster Frying Pan: ($33.32) High edge makes it harder to manipulate your food. No egg was stuck to the frying pan! </p>
<p> The Winner: The Gotham Steel Frying Pan ended up being the best one, with no egg getting stuck and the low edge makes it an all around great pan and a great value! </p>

<p> Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend </p>
<p> A hearty, convenient vegetable option. </p>
<p> Please note that this review was not paid for or sponsored by any third party. I purchased this product with my own money and the opinions in this review are strictly my own. I am not affiliated with Costco or any of its suppliers. I am just a fan of the company. I write these reviews to help my fellow shoppers. </p>
<p> When I’m at Costco picking out products to review, I always try to get an assortment of fun and healthy foods. I worry that people will find some of the reviews of healthier items boring, but I think there are a lot of people out there who are trying to eat healthy and will appreciate reviews on the healthier options that Costco has to offer. I know I’m always looking for reasonably-priced and tasty yet healthy foods as we try to stick to a healthy diet in our household (most of the time). So even though root vegetables might not be as fun or exciting as a Costco cake, they certainly qualify as healthy. </p>
<p> Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend </p>
<p> Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend </p>
<p> The Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend contains multicolour carrots, sweet potatoes, beets, turnips and red onions. This is actually a pretty tasty, hearty combination of root vegetables. All of the vegetables seemed to complement one another well. The vegetables aren’t seasoned, which I think is a good thing because you can put whatever seasoning you like on them. I just used a bit of salt and found the vegetables turned out to be quite delicious; their natural flavors weren’t overpowered. On the negative side, both my husband and I had a few bites of veggies that tasted very earthy, almost like they were moldy or dirty. It didn’t turn us off from carrying on with eating our vegetables, but we did both mention it to each other as we were eating. It seems somewhat normal/excusable given that these are root vegetables, but it certainly wasn’t ideal. The mix of vegetables was quite carrot-heavy, at least in the bag I purchased. There were only a few beets and onions. That was a bit disappointing, because I thought the onions added some strong, vibrant flavors to the mix and I just love beets. There were some crazy-looking purple and yellow carrots in the bag, but they tasted like good old orange carrots and were just as satisfying. </p>
<p> The Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend can be found in the freezer section at Costco, near the other frozen vegetables and fruit. The bag is quite large and the regular price is $9.99 Canadian. The price point isn’t bad; one bag should provide about four meals for a group four people (so about $2.50 Canadian per meal). </p>
<p> Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend </p>
<p> Buying frozen assorted vegetables like this is obviously much easier than buying an assortment of root vegetables, then washing and chopping them up. I don’t think most people would go to the trouble of preparing an assortment like this for a normal weeknight meal. You have the option of baking or steaming the vegetables, but baking is the recommended option. All you have to do is put your frozen vegetables in a bowl, toss them in a little bit of oil and season them to your taste. I recommend using the Costco Kirkland Signature Extra Virgin Olive Oil, which is a staple item in our kitchen. After that, you bake the vegetables at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for about 25 minutes. It’s super easy to do, and you can control what you put on your vegetables, which is perfect from a nutritional perspective. If you’re watching your sodium intake or want to really taste the natural flavors of the vegetables, you may choose to use no seasoning at all (although I think you would still want to use at least a little bit of healthy oil). </p>
<p> Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend </p>
<p> Due to the fact that the vegetables aren’t already seasoned, the nutritional information for the Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend is pretty fantastic. Half of a cup of vegetables contains 40 calories, 0.3 grams of fat, two grams of fibre, three grams of sugar, one gram of protein and 30 milligrams of sodium. Adding your oil and seasoning will change those numbers, but you’re in the driver’s seat and can use as much or as little oil and seasoning as you like. I used just a tiny splash of oil and a few sprinkles of salt and my vegetables came out just fine. If you use less oil, the vegetables might not become as golden and crisp when roasted. </p>
<p> Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend </p>
<p> If you’re a carrot fanatic or you’re looking for a new healthy, hearty frozen vegetable blend to try, I recommend trying the Premium Quality Family Tradition Cut Root Vegetable Blend. I’m not sure if we got an off bag with a few earthy, funky tasting vegetables, but I enjoyed the vegetables enough to finish the bag. I’m not sure whether we’ll repurchase this product; I could see us trying it again to see if the earthy-tasting vegetables were an exception or the norm. </p>

<p> Do you think these would be good as base for stews or soups, or do they need to be baked? </p>
<p> Irene March 1, 2019 | </p>
<p> I haven’ tried the root vegetables, but I will next time. But we always buy the bag of stur-fry vegetables, I immediately divide into 7 or 8 ziploc bags (there are only the two of us) and put those back into the big bag. In that way, I can grab a chicken breast ot ?, some stir fry sauce, some rice, and have a quick, delicious and healthy dinner in no tine. I really recommend this product, lots of lovely, tasty, c9lourful veggies, all ready for you to use. </p>
<p> Emma March 5, 2019 | </p>
<p> Great idea. I really like the stir fry veggies too. </p>
<p> Leon LaHay March 5, 2019 | </p>
<p> Used them a few times as roasted veggies, they are great!!! Fast and easy! </p>

<p> Chef’s tip For even more flavour, let chops marinate overnight. </p>
<p> Prep time </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). </p>
<p> Combine honey, mustard, thyme, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Set aside 60 mL (¼ cup) of the sauce. </p>
<p> Add chops to remaining sauce and coat well. Marinate in fridge for at least 30 minutes. </p>
<p> In the meantime, place vegetables, garlic, and spices in a 32 x 23 cm (13 x 9 in.) ovenproof dish. Season to taste. Add reserved sauce and a drizzle of oil and mix to combine. </p>
<p> Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. </p>
<p> Heat 30 mL (2 tbsp.) oil in a large skillet and cook chops over medium-high heat for 30 seconds per side. Season each side with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Place chops over vegetables, pressing them in gently. Divide onion over each chop. Cover and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes. Internal meat temperature should reach 70°C (160°C). Check temperature often during cooking since cooking times may vary from one oven to another. If vegetables need to be cooked longer, remove chops and wrap in aluminum foil, then continue baking vegetables until tender-crisp. </p>
<p> Divide chops and vegetables in four plates. Drizzle with cooking juice and serve with pasta like fettuccini with garlic butter and parsley. </p>

<p> Crispy Italian Oven Roasted Garlic Potatoes </p>
<p> These Crispy Italian Oven Roasted Garlic Potatoes will quickly become one of your favorite side dishes. Crispy on the outside; tender on the inside. These crispy roasted red potatoes are perfect for everyday fair or holiday entertaining. </p>
<p> It happens every. single. time. </p>
<p> It is, however, reassuring to know that I am not alone. At least, I don’t think I am… </p>
<p> I am, of course referring to the fact that every time I visit a farmers’ market, I get a little excited and carried away. </p>
<p> So, when I visited Atwater Market, a local Montreal farmers’ market, my intentions of not buying everything escaped me. Thank goodness my husband and son were present to help carry all the wonderful fruits and vegetables we purchased. </p>
<p> Hopefully… eventually… some of these season-appropriate vegetables will make it to the blog. I say this as I am thinking of the two (yes, two!) five-pound bag of beets which have been temporarily parked in my cold room. I must get to those before the end of the week. </p>
<p> But today… today, my friends we are talking spuds. In the past, I have already shared a few potato recipes with all of you. </p>
<p> These Potato Croquettes are, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorites. Did you know they could be made with leftover mashed potatoes? This is truly a great recipe! </p>
<p> Another family favorite is these Garlic Smashed Potatoes. What can I say except we love crispy oven-roasted potatoes? </p>
<p> The good news is that I have yet another recipe to share with all of you! If you have ever wondered how to roast potatoes, this is the recipe for you! The combination of garlic, potatoes and lots and lots of herbs makes it the perfect side dish. </p>
<p> There are thousands of potato varieties available. I am sure you know by your own experience that certain types of potatoes lend themselves better to specific methods of cooking. That is because potatoes have different textures. </p>
<p> This sliced roasted potatoes recipe requires red potatoes. </p>
<p> As you probably know, red potatoes: </p>
<p> have a waxy and firm texture; </p>
<p> will stay firm and retain their shape throughout the roasting time and </p>
<p> have a full flavor with a hint of sweetness. </p>
<p> This is the spud for us today! Are you ready to make the best garlic roasted potatoes? </p>
<p> How to make Italian Oven Roasted Garlic Potatoes: </p>
<p> The whole process begins by peeling and soaking potatoes before roasting. You will need about 4 large or 8 medium. </p>
<p> Cut them in quarters if they are large or in half if they are medium-sized. The potatoes need to soak for 1-2 hours so plan accordingly. </p>
<p> While the red potatoes are soaking, let’s chop up some wonderful herbs. Rosemary (1 tablespoon), parsley (3 tablespoons), sage (3 leaves) and about 6 cloves of garlic. </p>
<p> If you like heat, the addition of chili pepper is a must. </p>
<p> Speaking of heat, we need to turn on the oven to 425° F (220° C). </p>
<p> Place one oven grate at the bottom and one in the middle. We will also need a roasting pan large enough to fit all the sliced red potatoes in a single layer. </p>
<p> Another must is high-quality olive oil. So, once the soaking period is done, drain and pat dry the potatoes. </p>
<p> In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the olive oil, herbs, and spices. </p>
<p> Coat the potatoes well with the oil. </p>
<p> Next, drizzle a little olive oil at the bottom of the roasting pan and brush it across the entire surface. Arrange the potato halves (or quarters) in a single layer, flat side down. </p>
<p> In the oven they go… 15 minutes at 425° F (220° C) to begin with. Then lower the heat to 375° F (190° C) for another 35-45 minutes or so. </p>
<p> During the last 5 minutes, transfer the pan to the middle of the oven and turn on the heat to broil. </p>
<p> Now, at this point, you need to keep an eye on these potatoes in the oven. </p>
<p> We want crispy roast potatoes, not burnt ones. </p>
<p> The potatoes are ready when they are golden and crispy. Remove the pan from the oven and allow them to stand for a good 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Almost magically, the potato will reabsorb the oil… I bet you can’t wait to taste that roasted garlic goodness! </p>
<p> Italian Potato Recipes we love: </p>
<p> Origins of the recipe for Crispy Italian Oven Roasted Garlic Potatoes: </p>
<p> This simple side dish was a family favorite when I was growing up. It would often be served with fish, Italian roast chicken or veal scaloppini. Just like these Potato Croquettes, these oven-roasted red potatoes would quickly disappear from the supper table. I can remember more than one argument with my siblings as to who got to eat the last potato… </p>
<p> My mom would only use garlic, fresh parsley, and oregano when making this recipe. I love to add fresh sage and rosemary, so I’ve included these wonderful herbs. </p>
<p> Simple and wholesome ingredients for a tasty and simple side dish. </p>

<p> Comments </p>
<p> I can so relate to getting carried away at the farmers market, Maria! We love crispy roast potatoes at my house, and yours look perfect, especially with all the herbs. Delicious, as always! </p>
<p> Thanks so much Colleen! We also love our roasted garlic potatoes. You know what they say, birds of a feather… ♥♥♥ Thanks for stopping by. Have a great week-end! </p>
<p> Yummy! Roasted potatoes! These are the dishes I grew up with! Good old potatoes, skin removed (never had a potato with the skin on until I arrived in Canada), soaked in water, dressed in the best quality e.v.o. oil, garlic, herbs (usually rosemary or oregano), a bit of spice (which never hurts 😉 and then roasted to perfection. Yours look incredible and I would eat them every day!! </p>
<p> Thanks Nicoletta! I feel the same way about these roasted garlic potatoes 🙂 Thanks for dropping by ♥♥♥ </p>
<p> I love oven roasted potatoes. I could probably eat them every day, and these look soooo good! I completely agree about olive oil quality, it makes all the difference! </p>
<p> These roasted garlic potatoes can be very addictive… I know I can eat them everyday 😉 Thanks for dropping by Gabrielle 🙂 </p>
<p> This recipe looks delicious! I also like to go to farmers’ markets with my husband, and I have the second of two 5-lb. bags of beets sitting in my fridge! </p>
<p> I ALWAYS get carried away at Farmer’s markets – I want it all, lol! And I better not go hungry! Lovin’ these crispy tatos! Perfect side, especially for the upcoming holidays 🙂 </p>
<p> You and me together… roasted garlic potatoes is the way too go!!! Appreciate your comment 🙂 </p>
<p> I must admit, I could make a meal of this on their own rather than relegate them to a side dish. The crispy exterior well seasoned along with a creamy interior, what could be wrong! </p>
<p> I totally agree Paula!!! In fact I could not stop eating them… had to make another batch of these roasted garlic potatoes 😉 Thanks for dropping by my friend ♥♥♥ </p>
<p> My mom used to make these too. I tried to duplicate her recipe but could never get them crisp on the outside. Will definitely try your recipe. Getting hungry just thinking about it! Thank you. </p>
<p> My pleasure Gina. There are so many factors in making these roasted garlic potatoes crispy. The type of potato, the soaking of the potato, the drying of the potato and a hot oven all contribute to a crispy potato. Hope it turns out just the way you remember them. Appreciate your comment. Have a great week-end 🙂 </p>

<p> From Chiffonade to Julienne: A Guide to Culinary Cutting Terms </p>
<p> E-mail this to a friend! </p>
<p> send </p>
<p> Sent successfully </p>
<p> Failure, please try again later. </p>
<p> Every professional chef knows that the shape and size of an ingredient can make or break a dish. Why? Because ingredients cut into uniform pieces at an appropriate size not only cook more easily, but also taste better. </p>
<p> Before you prep your next meal, practice these eight culinary cutting terms and master the art of slicing and dicing once and for all. </p>
<p> 1. Brunoise </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s knife </p>
<p> To do a brunoise cut, the food must first be julienned then turned a quarter and diced again to create approximately 1/8-inch cubes. This cutting technique is ideal for carrots, onions, leeks, and celery, but can also be used with bell peppers and hard root vegetables like beets and turnips. Steer clear of this cut when preparing softer vegetables like green beans and cauliflower. </p>
<p> 2. Chiffonade </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s or paring knife </p>
<p> The chiffonade method is best for cutting herbs into long ribbons. Stack fresh basil or mint leaves, roll them up tight, and cut across hamburger style. This technique also works well for leafy greens like spinach, collards, and kale. </p>
<p> 3. Chop </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s knife </p>
<p> Used for a variety of foods, chopping is a casual, imprecise term that simply means to roughly cut food into bite-sized pieces. </p>
<p> 4. Cube </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s knife </p>
<p> Using a more precise method than chopping, cubed ingredients are cut to a uniform size (e.g. “1/2-inch cube”). This cut is used with many foods, from potatoes to meats to bread. </p>
<p> 5. Dice </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s knife </p>
<p> Generally smaller than a standard cube, the dice cut also creates uniform squares for even cooking and a polished look. Dicing is often used to make a classic salsa or mirepoix (a mix of carrots, onions, and celery). </p>
<p> 6. Julienne/French Cut </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s or paring knife </p>
<p> In julienne (or French) cut, the ingredient is cut into long, uniform strips like matchsticks. Julienne cut is often used for salad ingredients and green veggies, like cucumbers, bell peppers, and zucchini. </p>
<p> 7. Mince </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s knife or food processor </p>
<p> Minced ingredients are cut very, very finely. Mincing is the ideal cutting technique for aromatics, like onion, garlic, and ginger, where a paste-like consistency is a desirable end result. </p>
<p> 8. Slice </p>
<p> Recommended Tool: Chef’s, paring, or serrated knife </p>
<p> Slicing is a general term that means to cut across the grain into thin, uniform pieces. Almost every fruit or vegetable can be sliced, as well as other ingredients like cheese and bread. </p>

<p> That smoky taste and aroma you get from grilling a high-quality steak can't be matched by any other method, but if you have the right kind of steak and the right equipment, you may not need a grill at all. Although it sounds a little too simple, pan-frying a steak can yield some of the most impressive results, provided you use a suitable cut and follow the right process. </p>
<p> The Right Cut </p>
<p> For a juicy and tender pan-fried steak, it is important to choose cuts from areas of the cow that aren't used a lot in its day-to-day activities. Steaks from the rib or loin sections have less connective tissue and don't need a lot of time to break down during cooking. These include tenderloin, porterhouse, rib-eye, T-bone and top sirloin. The round steak and flank steak will also provide a tender pan-fried steak if you marinate ahead of time. </p>
<p> The Right Pan </p>
<p> Using a cast-iron pan to pan fry the steak will help bring out the flavor of the meat and develop a nice crust on both sides. The crust will be even over the surface of the steak and you can place a cast-iron pan in the oven if you choose to finish it that way. Provided you have chosen a cut from the rib, loin or round sections, heat your cast iron pan on the stovetop over medium heat before you start cooking. </p>
<p> The Thickness </p>
<p> The thickness of your pan-fried steak is entirely up to you, but if you use a tender cut it won't require as much time in the pan so you can increase the thickness. Because you can cook them quickly, steaks that are between 1 and 2 inches thick allow you to develop the crust you want on the outside without overcooking them on the inside. A thinner steak pan-fried using a quality cut of beef is still a treat, but if you have the choice and the right ingredients and equipment, make it a little thicker. </p>
<p> The Details </p>
<p> If the real results are in the details, you should follow a few important ones for pan-frying the perfect steak. The food safety element is important, stating that the internal temperature of your steak should be at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit, which is medium-rare. You should also avoid covering the pan while you're cooking the steak, even if you have a thick cut and finish it in the oven. Covering it will create steam and trap water, affecting the taste. Take the time to baste your steak in the pan as it cooks to develop the flavors further. Use the steak's own juices, or add a pad of butter halfway through the cooking process. </p>

<p> How to Lose Holiday Weight </p>
<p> Hey, guys! Eric Theiss here. Did you overindulge during the holidays? I sure did. But I’m not worried about losing those extra pounds. Why? I cook in Copper Chef, the nonstick pan that requires no butter or oil. I save hundreds of calories in just one meal— no matter what I’m cooking. </p>
<p> The Copper Chef Secret </p>
<p> How is this possible? My food never sticks to the bottom of Copper Chef because it’s coated with Advanced Cerami-Tech— even burnt cheese peels right out. With Copper Chef, I instantly eliminate calories from my diet without sacrificing taste or flavor. </p>
<p> High Protein Salmon Recipe </p>
<p> I’ve personally created some lower carb, lower calorie recipes for Copper Chef. My favorite is low-carb steamed salmon made with lemon and white wine. </p>
<p> I usually serve it with fresh pesto green beans (you can leave the pesto out if you want a super low-fat version). I use Copper Chef’s included chef-grade steaming basket. I get an easy and fast one-pot meal that helps the scales move down. </p>
<p> In the mood for baked salmon instead? The Copper Chef was designed to withstand extreme heat up to 850° F. I can take it straight from the stovetop and into the oven. </p>
<p> 60% More Healthy Cooking Space </p>
<p> Did you know the Copper Chef Pan has 25% more cooking space than ordinary pans? That’s because of its unique square design. When I want to make extra large family-size meals, I use the Copper Chef XL version. Best-selling Copper Chef became so popular, we decided to make a super-sized version that’s perfect for large families and parties. It’s the same nonstick pan but with a whopping 60% more cooking space than the average copper frying pan. </p>
<p> Of course, I’ve saved the best for last. With Copper Chef, you’re never stuck in the kitchen after dinner scrubbing burnt pan bottoms. Food slides right out so clean-up is really very simple. I get more time with my family and more time at the gym. Who wants to slave away in the kitchen soaking and scrubbing? </p>
<p> yellow squash </p>
<p> asparagus </p>
<p> Preheat the Copper Chef pan for 4 minutes on medium heat. Place salmon, skin side down, in the pan and cook for 5 minutes. Add the yellow squash and asparagus around the sides of the pan. Add sweet chili sauce and wine. Place the lid on the pan. Cook on medium heat until desired doneness or about 10 minutes. Serve. </p>

<p> Definition of Chop </p>
<p> Linda Larsen is a journalist, quick-cooking and slow-cooking expert, and accomplished cookbook author with over 30 years of experience in testing and developing recipes. </p>
<p> A chop is simply when meat is cut into squares, usually about a half an inch thick. The squares do not have to be perfect squares equal but should approximate the same size in order to cook evenly. </p>
<p> This is also known as a cut. </p>
<p> Example: "For stir-frying foods, each chop should be cut into the same size." </p>
<p> There are precise requirements for the cooking terms "chop", "dice", and "mince" and they all relate to size. "Chop" is for the largest size that food is cut into, usually about 1/2 inch in diameter. "Dice" is the next size down, usually about 1/4 inch, and "mince" is for the smallest size. Pay attention to these terms, because they make sure that the food you are about to cook will cook at the same time and in the correct amount of time. </p>
<p> Always use a sharp knife when you are performing these tasks. Surprisingly, using a dull knife means you will be more likely to hurt yourself. Sharpen your knife before every cooking session for the best results. Hold the food to be cut with your fingers curled under, and let the blade follow your fingers as you cut. This way you won't cut yourself. </p>

<p> Discover Chinese Tradition: Create a Unique "Chop" </p>
<p> Since ancient times, Chinese people have signed artwork and official documents with their names as well as a chop. The chop is a symbol, typically set inside a square, or four squares within a larger square. It usually contains unique calligraphic characters or motifs. Help your child design and print his own chop! This activity provides a perfect opportunity to teach him about an ancient Chinese tradition that still exists in present day. </p>
<p> What You Need: </p>
<p> Potato, sponge, Styrofoam, or large eraser (optional) </p>
<p> Watercolor paint or ink </p>
<p> Paintbrush </p>
<p> What You Do: </p>
<p> Share the tradition of chop design with your child. Explain they he can create his own, either referring to traditional Chinese characters or by creating brand new motifs. You may want to note that, although artists typically carve chops in jade or linoleum, the technique will be modified to make it accessible to them. </p>
<p> Give your child a chance to sketch different ideas on scratch paper. Remind him that he can use geometric shapes, repeating patterns, simple calligraphic lines, dots, or representational images. He should be able to contain the design within a square or rectangle to keep his creation in line with traditional methods. </p>
<p> Have your child create a final draft of his chop, using ink or watercolors. Tell him that he can choose to use only red ink or paint if he wants his chop to replicate its Chinese counterpart, but that it's perfectly fine to create a new and modern color design. </p>
<p> Have your child emulate the printmaking aspect of chop-creation by helping him carve his chop into half of a potato, a block of Styrofoam, or a large eraser. For larger or simpler chops, he can use cut pieces of sponge. </p>
<p> Tell your child to brush a thin layer of ink, watercolor, or tempera paint on the chop and press it to paper to print it. </p>
<p> Consider using this chop activity as a conclusion to a larger Asian art project, such as scroll painting or Sumi-e painting. Artists traditionally place the chop mark at the base of the painting, print, or document. </p>

<p> Dominican Fried Pork Chops </p>
<p> Dominican Fried Chops are a guilty deliciousness that goes great with rice, beans, tostones, maduros, mofongo– the works! It’s a fairly simple dish that’s jam packed with flavor. Each time I bite into a fried pork chop, my heart does somersaults. Such is my love for Dominican Style Fried Pork Chops. </p>
<p> Now you must be wondering… what in the world is a Dominican Fried Pork Chop and how does it differ from any other pork chops? Well, to start off, most Dominican fried foods do NOT call for flour or corn starch. There are some foods that you do fry with a flour based batter, but when it comes to frying meat, Dominicans don’t really use flour. In fact, I rarely use flour to fry any meats. I’m not the biggest fan of fried batter bits. Not to say that there aren’t any mouthwatering utterly delicious fried meats that are coated in batter. All I’m saying, is that I don’t have the biggest affinity of meats fried in this manner because I didn’t grow up eating and frying them that way. </p>
<p> Contrary to popular belief, you also don’t need a flour based batter to keep your meats juicy and golden brown with frying. You can easily brine your meats with salt, herbs, water, and citrus and end up with a juicy fried meat that drips down the side of your mouth. Mmm… are you hungry yet? </p>
<p> The secret to any Dominican Fried Meat aside from the seasoning is brining. I like to brine any meat that I fry for at least 30 mins hour or even a few hours. The longer the better, and the saltier the brine, the better. All you’re doing is infusing unforgettable savory flavors that ultimately come alive when you cook them. As always, once your marinate your meat, let it sit in the fridge so it can do its magic! </p>
<p> This dish is fairly simple and straight simple. The trick is to give the seasonings time to settle in and develop. The other trick is to fry the pork chops in hot oil– but not so hot where you end up burning the pork chop. The beauty with this dish, is that you can fry them as crispy as you like. I’m team extra crispy! </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Brine pork with fresh limes, vinegar, water, & salt. Let this sit for at least 30mins or an hour. However, long your tastebuds will allow. Just be sure to cover the pork chops completely with cold water. </p>
<p> Rinse the brine and then season with freshly mashed garlic, white vinegar, fresh thyme, a tiny bit of cumin, sazón with achiote, Dominican orégano or regular orégano, adobo, fresh lime juice, & olive oil </p>
<p> Mix everything until well combined </p>
<p> Let the pork marinade for an hour or overnight. The longer, the better </p>
<p> Warm up oil until it’s really hot ~350 degrees </p>
<p> Slowly add in your pork chops. I usually fry them two at a time. Remember that the pork chops have A LOT of juice and moisture so it will kick up your oil just a bit </p>
<p> Flip them after a few minute (3-5 minutes) You want to flip them once the pork chops start becoming a rich orange-y gold color </p>
<p> Flip it over once more and cook until it reaches your desired crispiness </p>
<p> Notes </p>

<p> Chopping your hair after the wedding? </p>
<p> I am spending the next year growing my strawberry blonde hair as long as I can get it for the big day. After the honeymoon, I plan to chop it short. I've always had long hair and my FH was not thrilled when I mentioned this but I feel like it will be freeing after the stress of wedding planning. </p>
<p> My photographer said they often don't recognize the brides when they come in for the pictures after the wedding because so many cut their hair short. </p>
<p> I'm planning on it. FH LOVES my hair short, and I'm already starting to grow it out lol. I'm so excited to chop it off, though!! </p>
<p> I am considering it. I wish I could did it now actually becasue my daughter pulls my hair. She will be playing with it then next thing you know she's pulling it. She's one and a half. </p>
<p> *but I am fight the urge to do it now because I am worried it wont be long enough. </p>
<p> FH and I are both chopping our long hair off after the wedding. If you are chopping off 10 inches or more, I'd suggest donating it to Locks of Love like we are. http://www.locksoflove.org/donate.html That way you will get your short hair and a sick child can have a wig to replace the hair that they have lost. </p>
<p> Definitely, my hair is too fine to wear it long and I can't stand it right now. The minute I get home from work, it's in a ponytail, I didn't realize how annoying longer hair would be. Won't go supershort, but definitely can't wait to get it above my shoulders again. </p>
<p> Haha, so many girls do it! My best friend is getting married 7 months before me and is mad she can't chop it because she wants it to be long fo rmy wedding photos, too! </p>
<p> Lock of Love is a great organization ... but they won't take color treated hair. </p>
<p> Their site I linked states "Hair that is colored or permed is acceptable." right up at the top as long as it has not been bleached recently as bleaching helps to breakdown the hair and ruins it. </p>
<p> I want to cut mine soo bad. I'm like 6-8 above my bum with it. I don't know if it'd be too long to do anything with for the big day. But, I'm afraid if I cut it, I might cut it too short to do anything with. Haha. So, I figured when I go to try styles if the stylist says "This is way too long to play with." I'll just tell them to cut it where they need it! </p>
<p> I am soooo going to cut my hair. I have always hated my hair long. I let it grow down below my butt, but got tired of it catching on things. One day got caught on the door latch of a car and my sister slammed the door shut. OUCH!! That day I chopped it off to my ears. Ever since then my hair barely gets past my shoulders before I cut it again. My FH has asked that I let it grow for the wedding. Its a simple enough request. </p>

<p> I am definitely cutting it off...Right now it is almost to my butt and after the wedding it will be right under my shoulders. I hate having it above because it won't stay in a ponytail when I do that. I'm seriously thinking about cutting it now and letting it grow out again since I still have enough time...but I think i'll miss it being this long... </p>
<p> Nooo! I love my long hair. (I say that now at least) </p>
<p> My mom's hair was GORGEOUS in all her pics before and during her wedding...then you turn the page in the album and it's sooo short. I always told myself I would not do that. We'll see though when it comes down to it. </p>
<p> Well, first let me explain my situation... about a year ago, I was getting ready for prom & wasn't happy with the length of my hair. I had seen an ad in a magizine many times for something that gave you 7 inches in 7 weeks. So, I bought it & used it religiously... It didn't work, in fact it stopped my hair growth period. My hair has grown maybe 3 inches since then & is now to my shoulders, I am hoping that my hair will grow atleast 3 mroe inches before the wedding, but I doubt it. I might even have to get extensions for the wedding, so I highly doubt I will cut my hair for fear of it never growing out. </p>

<p> I actually grow my hair long every two years..I don't know why, I didn't figure this out until recently, but it turns out I grow my hair out every 2 years, and this also happens to be the two year mark fo rgrow my hair long..so I am..I will see how long it tkaes for me to cut it short though..I do like m hair short..and I like it long also, I will probaly keep growing it until after the honeymoon, next april.. </p>
<p> My hair is the same length.. not growing it for the wedding.. but I always say I want to let it grow long in general but then It gets to a point where I cant stand it and cut it back to normal... </p>
<p> I will probably let is grow right back after I cut it, but I just want to do it and what better reason? </p>
<p> I'm a natural med brown and I normally do the at home color thingy. Do it lighter in spring and then add some red for the fall. </p>
<p> I havent colored it in over a year, because I want my natural hair color. FH thinks I'm funny, because I said as soon as we get back from honeymoon, I'm coloring it. </p>

<p> Easy Fried Venison Chops </p>
<p> I remember learning to fry venison in college. No, it wasn’t a class. Wish it was – I would have actually attended. I always had plenty of deer meat but little in the way of cooking experience, especially frying. As with other aspects of collegiate life I was inadequately prepared for, I blame my parents. My mother rarely fried foods, I guess, caring for our hearts more than our appetites. The backstraps and tenderloins were left whole to grill, and the rest was generally converted to ground venison for tacos, spaghetti, and the like. So, frying venison chops in the apartment was an exciting proposal. </p>
<p> And the fire alarms were exciting as I invariably filled the room to the brim with smoke. See, somehow, I had it in my mind that the proper way of frying anything was to heat the oil on the stove at the highest setting. Made the oil hotter faster, why not? The chops were always over-cooked coated in singed breadcrumbs. Delicious when covered with enough BBQ sauce and after several adult libations. </p>
<p> Luckily, these meals never ended in fire trucks and smoke inhalation trips to Shands. Turns out I became a whole lot smarter after I left college than when I was enrolled there, and I slowed my act down. It seems one can fry foods without a rolling plume of smoke emanating from the stovetop. </p>
<p> I bring this up, not only to satisfy my insatiable need to ramble and relay inane stories, but also to pass this knowledge around to others who may be in similar straits. The Internet was very much in its infancy then. I searched and surfed for recipes and help but found little. Recipes I did find took it for granted that any Joe Shmoe knew what they were doing in the kitchen. </p>
<p> The key elements to fried venison are a cast iron pan, canola oil, and medium-high heat. With this combination, you can fry just about any cut of venison. But for today’s purpose, I want to stick with fried venison backstrap chops. </p>
<p> In the field, leave the backstraps and tenderloins attached to the backbone and have your butcher cut bone-in chops about an inch thick. You can, of course, make boneless chops on your own; I like the little handle of bone to eat without a fork and knife like a savage. </p>
<p> In the kitchen, pour oil in the skillet until it’s about an inch deep. The oil will shimmer when it is ready. If you have any doubts, take a few fingertips of breading and flick it in the pan. It should immediately bubble and cook on the surface, and as they say, you’re now cooking with grease. If you're the anal type, though, use a thermometer to gauge when you hit the optimal temperature of 360-370 degrees. </p>
<p> Defrost your chops – talk about a mess if you don’t – and soak in icy cold water for 30 minutes or so to remove blood and gamey tastes, if you’re concerned about such things. Trim any fat or sinew away from the meat. Pat dry and press into Vigo Italian Breadcrumbs. </p>
<p> Place the breaded chops in the hot oil until browned on both sides for medium-rare to medium and remove to a paper towel-lined plate. It shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes. Nothing wrong with A-1 or a Mustard-Style BBQ sauce for dipping. </p>
<p> It’s not all that hard and is delicious. I’m a constant advocate for trying new things when cooking venison. If you’ve not tried frying a batch, you are missing out. </p>
<p> And remember, always put out grease fires with salt or an extinguisher. Never use water. Or adult libations. </p>

<p> On another note: I'm testing out "aged steak" tonight. Aged Addak steaks to be exact. Take steaks, wrap with cheesecloth, store in fridge (on top of a small rack), for four days. Natural enzymes break down the meat, tenderize, and boasts flavor. Wish me luck, and I hope I don't get ill </p>
<p> I know that I've said it before, but I'm going to say it again: you should really write a cook book. Seriously, I will buy a copy for me and I will buy copies for my friends. You reign victorious over venison Ian. Please, please say you will write a cook book. Please? </p>

<p> Easy Italian Veal Chops </p>
<p> Easy Italian Veal Chops are first browned in a skillet with olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs and then finished off in the oven creating a flavorful meal. Top your veal with mozzarella cheese and serve over your favorite pasta with sauce. </p>
<p> EASY ITALIAN VEAL CHOPS </p>
<p> In my house we try to eat a wide variety of meats, vegetables, grains and fruits. I like to expose my family to as much as possible and let them develop their tastes on their own. Today’s Easy Italian Veal Chops were a big hit in my house and for good reason. </p>
<p> These veal chops are super easy to make and are bursting with flavor. I particularly love the garlic and fresh herbs that infuse the veal. When I created these Easy Italian Veal Chops I drew inspiration from a meal my parents liked to eat when I was young, veal parmesan. </p>
<p> I remember that being one of their favorite meals and I knew the flavors of that dish would work well with the fresh herbs on this veal dish. Similar to veal parmesan I paired the veal chops with a topping of cheese {as much as you like and you can easily add it at the end of cooking to help melt the cheese} and a side of my favorite pasta with sauce. </p>
<p> A lot of people I talk to don’t know how to cook with veal. I am excited to be partnering with the Ohio Beef Council to help you all cook the perfect veal chop and share with you the nutritional benefits of eating veal. It is rich in nutrients, especially protein, zinc, niacin, vitamins B-12 and B-6. Veal is extremely lean, with a 3 oz. serving only containing an average of 5.6 grams of fat and 160 calories. That means that a 3 oz. serving is not only lean but packs a lot of nutrients in. </p>
<p> For this recipe I bought 4 veal chops totaling to 2 pounds of meat. When buying veal look for veal that is creamy pink in color with a fine-grained texture. If there is fat covering, it should be milky white. There should be very little if any fat marbling. Be careful to choose packages that are cold, tightly wrapped and without punctures or tears. Do not purchase packages that have excessive juice. </p>
<p> When you are ready to cook your Italian Veal Chops create a quick olive oil and fresh herb marinade for the chops. Heat a skillet over medium high heat, adding the olive oil and garlic and letting it sauté for two minutes. Add the veal chops to the skillet and brown both sides for about 2 minutes per side. </p>
<p> After browning the veal chops, finish them off in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the internal temperature reads 160 degrees F. In the last two minutes of cooking sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese and let it melt in the oven. Remove and serve with your favorite pasta and sauce. This is an easy weeknight meal but also an elegant meal for those special occasions. </p>
<p> HOW ARE THE CATTLE CARED FOR? </p>
<p> Veal farmers purchase dairy calves when they weigh 100 pounds and raise them until they are 5-6 months old. Veal calves live indoors, protected from extreme heat and cold, in group pens where they can socialize and receive food and veterinary care. </p>
<p> Seven hundred farm families raise veal calves in the United States. </p>
<p> Veal calves are fed nutritionally-balanced milk or soy-based diets. These specially-controlled diets contain iron and 40 other essential nutrients, including amino acids, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and vitamins. </p>
<p> HOW DO YOU COOK VEAL? </p>
<p> Veal can be sautéed, stir-fried, braised, stewed, grilled or broiled. Choosing the right method of preparation is very important. And with many types of meats, it is really important not to overcook your veal. </p>
<p> Savor the flavor: You can marinate veal in the refrigerator for up to five days for chops, roasts or steaks. </p>
<p> For the best braised or stewed dishes: brown slowly to develop rich flavor, cover tightly to retain steam, and simmer gently over a very low heat. </p>
<p> Trim the fat after cooking! To preserve juiciness, leave a thin layer of fat on roasts, chops and steaks. </p>

<p> For serving </p>
<p> Pasta </p>
<p> Tomato sauce </p>
<p> Shredded mozzarella or parmesan cheese </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a small mixing bowl combine 3 Tablespoons of olive oil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, Italian parsley and crushed red pepper {optional} and stir. Add a dash of salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Place the veal chops on a large cutting board or two large plates. Brush the olive oil and herb mixture on both sides of all of the chops. Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the chops. </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. </p>
<p> Heat 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in an oven safe large skillet over medium high heat {if you don't have an oven safe skillet you can transfer the veal chops to a baking dish for the oven}. Add the garlic and sauté for two minutes. Add the veal chops and let them brown on one side for 2 minutes, flip and brown the other side for two minutes. </p>
<p> Place the skillet with the veal chops into the oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chops reaches 160 degree F. </p>
<p> OPTIONAL: During the last couple of minutes of cooking you can add the mozzarella cheese to the veal chops and let it melt. </p>
<p> Serve with your favorite pasta and sauce garnished with fresh Italian parsley. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> You can make the olive oil herb marinade about of whatever fresh herbs you might have on hand. Basil and sage work wonderfully as well. </p>
<p> If you don't like spice, skip the crushed red pepper. </p>

<p> Easy Pan-Seared Chicken Breasts </p>
<p> Easy Pan-Seared Chicken Breasts have a crunchy crust and lots of flavor from Italian seasoning! This easy chicken recipe turns out excellent every single time! </p>
<p> Easy pan-seared chicken breasts is one of my favorite ways to make chicken. You pan fry chicken right in the skillet. So that you can enjoy crunchy crust and lots of flavor! It’s an excellent way to cook boneless and skinless chicken breasts when you are short on time. </p>
<p> How to make easy pan-seared chicken breasts </p>
<p> To make this pan seared chicken, make sure to use thin boneless skinless chicken breasts. You can easily dredge them in the flour mixture. Another selling point is since they are flatter, they retain the coating better. By the way, I also used thin chicken breasts in this Parmesan Crusted Chicken recipe. </p>
<p> Besides, boneless chicken breasts are so easy to find! They are also low in fat and high in protein. So perfect! </p>
<p> To dredge chicken breasts, you will use all purpose unbleached flour. By the way, flour is one of the best coatings for frying or searing chicken. And it always produces nice and smooth coating. </p>
<p> How about whole wheat flour for dredging? Of course, you can use whole wheat flour, too. Whole wheat flour is very flavorful and will taste slightly different. </p>
<p> To make this pan-seared chicken gluten free: </p>
<p> Use rice flour to get a beautiful golden crust on your chicken. </p>
<p> Other mild-flavored flours that also work well include: specialty gluten-free flour mixes, corn flour and potato starch flour. </p>
<p> Or, if you are able to tolerate nut flours, almond flour works great for coating and pan searing chicken. It also gives it a beautiful color. </p>
<p> I also have instructions on searing thick chicken breasts where I don’t use flour at all. In fact, you can compare and see how different the process is when chicken is thicker: How to sear thick chicken breasts. </p>
<p> How to coat the chicken breasts </p>
<p> First, paper towel dry the chicken. Next, in a large bowl, combine flour, sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning. Immediately stir well to blend. </p>
<p> Then, using a fork or tongs, coat the chicken breasts in the flour mixture and set aside. The reason why we want to dredge chicken in flour is simple! It’s because we want to make chicken’s surface attain a more attractive brown color. And we also want to get some crisp on the outside. </p>
<p> Additionally, you can also coat the chicken by tossing it with the flour. Use either a plastic bag, a paper bag or a plastic container with a lid. </p>
<p> Or, you can sprinkle the flour onto a plate. Then roll the chicken breasts around in it, while pressing it into the flour. </p>
<p> Searing chicken breasts </p>
<p> This easy pan seared chicken recipe produces a lovely crisp coating. It’s not the least bit heavy. What you really taste is the chicken, not the coating. And that’s how it should be. The coating is just barely there to complement the food. </p>
<p> First things first, you will heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. </p>
<p> Once the skillet is hot, you will place flour coated chicken breasts in the skillet. </p>
<p> Next you will sear chicken breasts them for 4 to 5 minutes on each side. They should turn golden brown in color on both sides. </p>
<p> Finally, I recommend to turn them only once between cooking. And the total cooking time should not exceed 8-10 minutes. </p>
<p> Both hold heat incredibly well and are easy to cook with. I cooked most of the recipes on this site with one of these two skillets. </p>

<p> I used almond flour, butter instead of oil and pounded my chicken a bit before cooking. It came out delicious. Took about 10 min on one side, flipped and put the lid on and cooked for 10 more minutes. </p>
<p> Family loved this–we used gf tapioca starch to coat and finished it up in the airfryer (as I didn’t think it would cook through in the pan). </p>
<p> I like thin sliced chicken breasts for the ease of cooking even tho I don’t cook a lot I’m getting there. The chicken was good and moist thanks to using an insta read thermometer. The recipe was easy to follow, next time I’m playing with the spices maybe add a little red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe. </p>
<p> What if I have more chicken then will fit in the pan? Can I use the same oil & pan multiple times? I like to prep a lot at once of the whole week! </p>
<p> Drying and coating the cutlet made all the difference. Thank you so kindly, good author. This will become a regular staple. You have given me a treasure. </p>
<p> Once you’ve cooked the chicken cover it with foil and let it rest. Any uncooked chicken will cook in this process. Make sure the heat is turned off. </p>
<p> Loved this except my chicken wasnt throughly cooked thru 🙁 I seem to have that problem maybe I’m not flattening them enough! </p>
<p> I’m glad you liked it! I usually put a lid on and keep it on low heat for a bit if it’s not cooked through. Just a little bit, it won’t affect the crisp. </p>

<p> Easy Pan-Seared Pork Chops </p>
<p> Are you in a search for a perfectly pan-seared pork chop that is still slightly pink in the center? Or, do you hate pork because it’s always overcooked and dry? In this post I will walk you through the process of how to fry a mouth-watering pork chop to golden perfection. </p>
<p> These pan-fried pork chops truly have more flavor that you will ever guess. It’s a guaranteed way to make sure that every single bite of pork chop disappears from your plate. This basic recipe is living proof that a few simple ingredients can create amazing results in the kitchen. </p>
<p> I’ll walk you through best pork chop cuts, pork chop basics and how to achieve that perfect sear. Perfectly cooked pork chop is always cooked to a nice medium instead of the shoe leather texture and is pinkish inside. </p>
<p> Best Cuts of Pork for Searing </p>
<p> Boneless pork chops are excellent for searing because they are thick and tender. </p>
<p> You can also use loin chops because they are leaner than center cut chops. </p>
<p> Center cut, bone-in chops work as well. They are also very lean. </p>
<p> Pork Chop Basics </p>
<p> Either boneless or bone-in pork chops will do. I prefer the thick cut pork chops because they are easier to work with:). </p>
<p> The lack of bone also means that they can be less flavorful, while the lack of fat can create a dry texture and it’s often recommended that you brine them prior to searing. However, I personally find that I don’t plan my meals very well ahead of time in order to brine them. Instead, I prefer to follow these tips and tricks on how to sear a perfect pork chop. </p>
<p> Take your pork chops out of the fridge and let your them rest for 20 minutes on the counter before cooking them so they come to room temperature. This will ensure they cook on the inside and the center reaches the perfect temperature. </p>
<p> Generously season your pork chops because pork chop crust is important for flavor. Being liberal with seasoning this will make for a delicious and flavorful pork chop crust. </p>
<p> To properly cook the pork chops, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, don’t rely blindly on cooking time. </p>
<p> Let the pork chops rest on a plate for 10 minutes – they will continue to cook and the residual heat will bring them to the recommended 145 F degrees. </p>
<p> Cooking time can vary based on the thickness of the pork chops. </p>
<p> How to sear pork chops to golden perfection </p>
<p> Start by patting your chops dry and sprinkling them very liberally with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Use a cast iron for a nice, golden sear. It conducts heat the best and will give the pork chops a nice even color. </p>
<p> Preheat your skillet to medium high and add the olive oil. When it’s shimmering hot and not a moment before, add your chops. </p>
<p> Sear over medium-high heat without moving the pork chop. </p>
<p> Resist the urge to move the pork chops around or look underneath as they cook, it will disrupt the sear. Once the pork chops are golden brown on the first side, you can flip. Do not sear more than 5 minutes. </p>
<p> If the pork chops are stuck to the pan, try giving them more time. They generally release from the pan when they’re crisp on the outside and ready to flip. This takes about 4 minutes per side. </p>
<p> Flip and sear the other side until browned. Remove them from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes before cutting into them. </p>
<p> How to tell if the pork chop is done </p>
<p> Not sure how to tell how done a chop is? The pros do it by feel and a steak or chop cooked medium should have a slight resistance when you press on it with your finger but not feel hard and solid. </p>
<p> The easiest way to check if the pork chop is done is to use meat thermometer. When they reach an internal temperature of 135 F degrees they are done. Remove them from the skillet and let them rest on a plate for 10 minutes, during which time they will continue cooking with the residual heat and will eventually reach 145 F degrees. Do remember that cooking time can vary based on the thickness of the pork chops. </p>

<p> Sear on one side, without moving them at all, until they are nice and golden brown on the first side, about 3-5 minutes. Flip and sear the other side until browned. </p>

<p> Excellent recipe. The pork chops came out flavorful and moist. I used thin cut chops and only cooked them about 2-3 minutes per side. After sitting for about 5 minutes they were perfectly done! Thank you for a quick and tasty dinner! </p>
<p> Best stove top chops yet! Thank you for the divine recipe and cooking tips. I am a newbie to pork cookery. I used a thyme, oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic, paprika rub for the bone in loin chopps. I removed from pan and finished up the cooking as you suggested on a heated plate. Darn, they were great…..so tender. EVERYONE loved them. Served with steamed brussel sprouts, short grain brown rice and sauteed fresh oyster mushrooms and thinly sliced red onion. Look forward to the next offering. Thanks so much, Gwendolyn </p>
<p> Pork chops were always dry, tried your recipe with a little twist of honey and garlic rub, it was tasty, tender and the best I’ve ever made. Thank you.. </p>
<p> Hi Olga, I followed your directions to the T and these were the BEST Pork Chops I ever had. Better than any restaurant!!! Thank you for sharing!! </p>
<p> Never cooked pork chops before, slightly modified and substituted paprika with sage (the house smells great). Simple and easy to follow. Thank you! </p>
<p> I lost my Annie after 66 years of bliss and to tell the truth, I can’t cook worth a damn so I rely on others such as you. Your directions were easy to follow and all worked out fine. Bookmarked your site for the future. Thanks and best, john </p>
<p> I’m so sorry for your loss, John. So glad you liked the pork chops and recipe directions! Please come back for more. </p>

<p> Feast of the Seven Fishes </p>
<p> The Feast of the Seven Fishes (Italian: Festa dei sette pesci), also known as The Eve (La Vigilia, cognate to The Vigil), is an Italian-American celebration of Christmas Eve with dishes of fish and other seafood.[1][2] </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> The Feast of the Seven Fishes is part of the Italian-American Christmas Eve celebration, although it is not called that in Italy and is not a "feast" in the sense of "holiday," but rather a grand meal.[1][3] Christmas Eve is a vigil or fasting day, and the abundance of seafood reflects the observance of abstinence from meat until the feast of Christmas Day itself. </p>
<p> Today, the meal typically consists of seven different seafood dishes. The tradition comes from Southern Italy, where it is known simply as The Vigil (La Vigilia). This celebration commemorates the wait, the Vigilia di Natale, for the midnight birth of the baby Jesus. It was introduced in the United States by Southern Italian immigrants in New York City's Little Italy in the late 1800s.[citation needed] </p>
<p> The long tradition of eating seafood on Christmas Eve dates from the Roman Catholic tradition of abstaining from eating meat on the eve of a feast day.[1] As no meat or animal fat could be used on such days, observant Catholics would instead eat fish (typically fried in oil). </p>
<p> While the first reference to the feast was seen in 1980s in The New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer,[citation needed] it is unclear when the term "Feast of the Seven Fishes" was popularized. The meal may include seven, eight, or even nine specific fishes that are considered traditional. However, some Italian-American families have been known to celebrate with nine, eleven or thirteen different seafood dishes. "Seven" fishes as a fixed concept or name is unknown in Italy itself. In some of the oldest Italian American families, there was no count of the number of fish dishes. Dinner began with whiting in lemon, followed by some version of clams or mussels in spaghetti, baccalà and onward to any number of other fish dishes. </p>
<p> The most famous dish for Southern Italians is baccalà (salted cod fish). The custom of celebrating with a simple fish such as baccalà reflects customs in what were historically impoverished regions of Southern Italy, as well as seasonal factors. Fried smelts, calamari and other types of seafood have been incorporated into the Christmas Eve dinner over the years. </p>
<p> There are many hypotheses for what the number seven represents. Seven is the most repeated number in the Bible and appears over 700 times.[citation needed] </p>
<p> One popular theory is the number represents completion, as shown in Genesis 2:2: "By the seventh day God completed the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work." During the feast of the seven fishes, participants celebrate the completion of God's promise of the Messiah through Jesus.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Other theories include: that the number represents the seven Sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church; or it represents the Seven hills of Rome that surround the city.[1][2] It may represent perfection (the traditional Biblical number for divinity is three, and for Earth is four, and the combination of these numbers, seven, represents God on Earth, or Jesus Christ).[citation needed] </p>
<p> The graphic novel Feast of the Seven Fishes, written by Robert Tinnell (2005; ISBN 0976928809), has been made into a feature film also titled Feast of the Seven Fishes, featuring Madison Iseman and Skyler Gisondo, released 15 November 2019.[4] </p>
<p> The movie A Wedding for Bella or The Bread, My Sweet, starring Scott Baio and Kristin Minter, contains a reference to and the celebration of the Feast of the Seven Fish in an Italian American family. </p>
<p> Philadelphia tee shirt company South Fellini started producing The Shirt of The Seven Fishes featuring a list of the most popular fish. </p>
<p> In the Golden Girls episode "Have Yourself a Very Little Christmas" Sophia mentions that fried eel is a customary Christmas tradition in many Italian (Sicilian) households. She goes on to say "In Sicily it wouldn't be Christmas without eels and larks."[5] Fried, steamed or dried eel is usually one of the fish included in the "Seven Fishes" tradition, though many Italians and Sicilians in particular simply refer to it as the vigil or Christmas dinner; a meal typically free of red meat and consisting entirely of seafood.[6][7] </p>

It's a Southern Italian (and now Italian-American) custom in which a grand meal of at least seven different kinds of seafood is served before midnight Mass The fish part comes from the Catholic practice of abstaining from meat on Christmas Eve, while the number may refer to the seven sacraments. </p>

Each dish is cooked in a different manner – broiled, fried, baked and so on – or uses a different main ingredient. There is generally a fish or seafood salad and, inevitably, pasta served with a seafood sauce. ... </p>

<p> First haircut </p>
<p> The first haircut for a human has special significance in certain cultures and religions. It can be considered a rite of passage or a milestone. </p>
<p> In Hindu tradition, the hair from birth is associated with undesirable traits from past lives. Thus at the time of the mundan, the child is freshly shaven to signify freedom from the past and moving into the future. It is also said that the shaving of the hair stimulates proper growth of the brain and nerves, and that the sikha, a tuft at the crown of the head, protects the memory.[1] </p>
<p> Hindus practice a variety of rituals from birth to death. Collectively these are known as saṃskāras, meaning rites of purification, and are believed to make the body pure and fit for worship. A boy's first haircut, known as choula, is one such samskara and is considered an event of great auspiciousness. The lawbooks or smritis prescribe that a boy must have his haircut in his first or third year. While complete tonsure is common, some Hindus prefer to leave some hair on the head, distinguishing this rite from the inauspicious tonsure that occurs upon the death of a parent. Those that practice complete tonsure generally ritually offer the hair to their family deity. Many travel to temples such as the famed Tirumala Venkateswara Temple of Lord Vishnu to perform this ceremony. </p>
<p> Traditionally, a Hindu girl never has her hair cut after the first haircut which generally happens at the age of 11 months; So the first haircut for the girl is very important because that is the only time they do. However, some Hindus practice a tonsure ceremony for girls as well. The details vary by sect, locality, family, and country. </p>
<p> And also old timer Hindu people said that a newborn baby should bald their hair as cannot be with newborn hair for so long as it was a sign of a bad luck. Most of the people will bald their babies hair in the age of 3-5 months and Hindu also follow odd months to do.(Revathy) </p>
<p> In some Brahmin households, a baby girl's hair is never shaved. </p>
<p> At the twentieth day from birth, Maliku babies' heads are shaven and the hair is weighed against gold or silver, which is given to the poor. The ceremony is called boabeylun. </p>
<p> Mongolian children get their first haircut in early ages between 2-5. Depending on the lunar calendar, boys receive their first hair cut in their odd year and girls in even year. The ritual of cutting the first hair is called Daah' Urgeeh. It is a big occasion for a whole family when guests are invited. Each guest cuts a strand of hair, saying his wishes to the child, and gives a gift. </p>
<p> A rabbi performs the traditional first haircut on a three-year-old boy in Meron on Lag BaOmer 1970. </p>
<p> Many Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish boys get their first haircut when they are three years old. The hair-cutting ceremony is known in Yiddish as the upsherenish or upsherin (shear off), and in Hebrew as halaqah (smoothing). </p>
<p> In Israel, there are also non-religious families who adhere to this custom and do not cut their sons' hair until the age of three. A mass hair cutting ceremony is held on the holiday of Lag BaOmer at the tomb of Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai in the Galilean town of Meron. </p>
<p> The Aqiqah ceremony involves shaving the child's head seven days after birth and anointing the child’s head with saffron.[2] It is traditional to give in charity gold or silver equal in weight to the hair.[2] This does not have to be done by actually weighing the hair; if it is too difficult to do that, it is sufficient to estimate the weight and give paper currency equivalent to the price of that amount of gold or silver. </p>
<p> The ritual first haircut (Polish: postrzyżyny) was a pre-Christian, all-Slavic tradition, though it survived in Poland well into the 18th century. This first haircut traditionally took place between the ages of 7 and 10, and was conducted by either the boy's father or a stranger, who would thus enter into the boy's family.[3] Before that age the boy's life was connected to his mother and he was treated as a child. The ritual haircut, coupled with the granting of an additional given name (usually the third), marked the boy's coming of age and a transition to the world of men, in which he was to be looked after by his father.[4] The ritual also constituted the father's formal act of recognition of the boy as a son.[4] </p>
<p> Ukrainian babies often have their hair cut on their first birthday as part of the ancient Postryzhennya custom.[5] </p>
<p> In Cook Islands tradition, the haircutting ceremony is a rite of passage for young boys. At these large gatherings the boy sits on a chair draped with tīvaevae (quilts). As his hair is cut, members of the community plaster the boy with money or other gifts. The custom serves to maintain reciprocal ties within the extended family and community.[6] </p>
<p> Traditionally, Niuean boys do not cut their hair, which is lovingly cared for by sisters, mothers and fathers . When the boys become teenagers, a ceremony is held where women tend the hair for the last time before it is cut. Members of the extended family plaster the youth with banknotes – all part of a large informal Niuean economy that links families and ensures the community looks after its own.[7] </p>
<p> Some Native American tribes commemorated the first haircut with a ritualistic dance. The Apache tribe had a springtime ritual. </p>
<p> Within the African Caribbean community this is performed once the child begins to speak clearly or after the child reaches two. This is usually done in a barbershop or carried out by the parent. </p>
<p> In the Yazidi tradition (mainly in Iran), the bisk ceremony involves cutting of a baby boy's two or three first locks, according to old traditions by his 40th day after birth to be given to the family's shaikh and pir, but in modern practice at 7 to 11 months, and kept by the family. The bisk ceremony is regarded as the central initiatory ritual by most Yazidis from Turkey, Armenia. and Syria. In the European Diaspora, the term is often translated as baptism. The ceremony is reminiscent of the Muslim 'aqiqa celebrated on the seventh day after birth, but the Yazidi ceremony takes place at a later stage, when the child has already been named. </p>
<p> Tonsure, traditional practice of Christian churches of cutting or shaving the hair from the scalp (while leaving some parts uncut) of clerics, monastics, and, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, all baptized members. </p>

<doc id="file14874928" filename="French_cuisine" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_cuisine">
<p> French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine. </p>
<p> French cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices from France. </p>
<p> French cuisine developed throughout the centuries influenced by the many surrounding cultures of Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic, the Channel and of course inland. In the 14th century, Guillaume Tirel, a court chef known as "Taillevent", wrote Le Viandier, one of the earliest recipe collections of medieval France. In the 17th century, chefs François Pierre La Varenne and Marie-Antoine Carême spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.[citation needed] </p>
<p> French cuisine was made important in the 20th century by Auguste Escoffier to become the modern haute cuisine; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the regions of France and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. Culinary tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to acquaint people[who?] with the cuisine bourgeoise of the urban elites[dubious – discuss] and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. Gascon cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country. </p>
<p> Knowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and culinary education. In November 2010, French gastronomy was added by the UNESCO to its lists of the world's "intangible cultural heritage".[1][2] </p>

<p> In French medieval cuisine, banquets were common among the aristocracy. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called service en confusion, or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the Late Middle Ages that the shortcrust pie was developed. Meals often ended with an issue de table, which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of dragées (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as hypocras.[3]:1–7 </p>
<p> The ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were brined and dried. Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during Lent, the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.[3]:9–12 </p>
<p> Artificial freshwater ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.[3]:13–15 </p>
<p> Visual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.[3]:15–16 </p>
<p> The most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was Guillaume Tirel, also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to Philip VI, then the Dauphin who was son of John II. The Dauphin became King Charles V of France in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, marmites, on it.[3]:18–21 </p>
<p> Paris was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as Les Halles, la Mégisserie, those found along Rue Mouffetard, and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the guild system, which developed in the Middle Ages. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.[3]:71–72 </p>
<p> There were two groups of guilds – first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, pastry cooks, sauce makers, poulterers, and caterers. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the charcutiers and rôtisseurs (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.[3]:72–73 The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the guild hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.[3]:73 </p>
<p> During the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the New World. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show Catherine de' Medici (1519–1589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.[3]:81 The dish called cassoulet has its roots in the New World discovery of haricot beans, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by Christopher Columbus.[3]:85 </p>
<p> Haute cuisine (pronounced [ot kɥizin], "high cuisine") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named La Varenne. As author of works such as Le Cuisinier françois, he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to roux using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for fasting. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled Le Parfait confitvrier (republished as Le Confiturier françois) which similarly updated and codified the emerging haute cuisine standards for desserts and pastries.[3]:114–120 </p>
<p> Chef François Massialot wrote Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois in 1691, during the reign of Louis XIV. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a marinade is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.[3]:149–154 </p>
<p> The successive updates of Le Cuisinier roïal et bourgeois include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to fish stock. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois, was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. Ragout, a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.[3]:155 </p>
<p> Shortly before the French Revolution, dishes like bouchées à la Reine gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on vol-au-vent created under the influence of Queen Marie Leszczyńska, the Polish-born wife of Louis XV. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczyńska like consommé à la Reine and filet d'aloyau braisé à la royale. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing lentils to the French diet and Polonaise garnishing. </p>
<p> The French Revolution was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation's people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.[4] According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup. In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708–1789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.[4] </p>
<p> More important to Carême's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named mother sauces. Often referred to as fonds, meaning "foundations", these base sauces, espagnole, velouté, and béchamel, are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Carême had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, soufflés appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were Le Maître d'hôtel français (1822), Le Cuisinier parisien (1828) and L'Art de la cuisine française au dix-neuvième siècle (1833–5).[5]:144–148 </p>
<p> Georges Auguste Escoffier is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of haute cuisine and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s – 1890s. The Savoy Hotel managed by César Ritz was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of "parties" called the brigade system, which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations. </p>
<p> These five stations included the "garde manger" that prepared cold dishes; the "entremettier" prepared starches and vegetables, the "rôtisseur" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the "saucier" prepared sauces and soups; and the "pâtissier" prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is "oeufs au plat Meyerbeer", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the rôtisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.[5]:157–159 </p>
<p> Escoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.[5]:159–160 </p>
<p> Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine. </p>
<p> Expensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as pêche Melba.[5]:160–162 Escoffier updated Le Guide Culinaire four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an "exhaustive" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, "it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day."[6] </p>
<p> The 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the Colonial Wars Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques. </p>
<p> This period is also marked by the appearance of the nouvelle cuisine. The term "nouvelle cuisine" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, Menon first used the term, but the cooking of Vincent La Chapelle and François Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, Henri Gault and Christian Millau revived it to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Guérard, Roger Vergé and Raymond Oliver.[7] These chefs were working toward rebelling against the "orthodoxy" of Escoffier's cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of Fernand Point at the Pyramide in Vienne, and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau "discovered the formula" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.[5]:163–164 </p>
<p> The first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and pâtés was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as espagnole and béchamel thickened with flour based "roux", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.[5]:163–164 </p>
<p> Some have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.[8] By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.[5]:163–164 </p>
<p> There are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today. </p>
<p> A meal often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. </p>
<p> French regional cuisine is characterized by its extreme diversity and style. Traditionally, each region of France has its own distinctive cuisine.[9] </p>
<p> Paris and Île-de-France are central regions where almost anything from the country is available, as all train lines meet in the city. Over 9,000 restaurants exist in Paris and almost any cuisine can be obtained here. High-quality Michelin Guide-rated restaurants proliferate here.[10] </p>
<p> Game and ham are popular in Champagne, as well as the special sparkling wine simply known as Champagne. Fine fruit preserves are known from Lorraine as well as the quiche Lorraine. Alsace is influenced by the German cuisine, especially the one from the Palatinate and Baden region. As such, beers made in the area are similar to the style of bordering Germany. Dishes like choucroute (the French word for sauerkraut) are also popular.[10]:55 Many "Eaux de Vie" (alcoholic distillation) also called schnaps is from this region, due to a wide variety of local fruits (cherry, raspberry, pear, grapes) and especially prunes (mirabelle, plum).[9]:259,295 </p>
<p> "Carte Gastronomique de la France" belong to the outset of the "Cours Gastronomique" by Charles Louis Cadet de Gassicourt (1809). </p>
<p> Nord Pas-de-Calais, Picardy, Normandy, and Brittany[edit] </p>
<p> The coastline supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has top quality seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has a supply of lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy is home to a large population of apple trees; apples are often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some of the best in the country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.[10]:93 </p>
<p> High-quality fruits come from the Loire Valley and central France, including cherries grown for the liqueur Guignolet and the 'Belle Angevine' pears. The strawberries and melons are also of high quality. Fish are seen in the cuisine, often served with a beurre blanc sauce, as well as wild game, lamb, calves, Charolais cattle, Géline fowl, and goat cheeses. Young vegetables are used often in the cuisine, as are the specialty mushrooms of the region, champignons de Paris. Vinegars from Orléans are a specialty ingredient used as well.[10]:129, 132 </p>
<p> Oysters come from the Oléron-Marennes basin, while mussels come from the Bay of Aiguillon. High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, especially goat cheese. This region and in the Vendée is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. The region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. Limousin is home to the Limousin cattle, as well as sheep. The woodlands offer game and mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.[10]:237 </p>
<p> Bordeaux, Périgord, Gascony, and Basque country[edit] </p>
<p> Bordeaux is known for its wine, with certain areas offering specialty grapes for wine-making. Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the Bay of Biscay, trapping in the Garonne and stream fishing in the Pyrenees. The Pyrenees also support lamb, such as the "Agneau de Pauillac", as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the Blonde d'Aquitaine, Boeuf de Chalosse, Boeuf Gras de Bazas, and Garonnaise. Free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, capon, goose and duck prevail in the region as well. Gascony and Périgord cuisines includes patés, terrines, confits and magrets. This is one of the regions notable for its production of foie gras or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based. Armagnac is also from this region, as are prunes from Agen.[10]:259,295 </p>
<p> Gers, a department of France, is within this region and has poultry, while La Montagne Noire and Lacaune area offers hams and dry sausages. White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of millas, a cornmeal porridge. Haricot beans are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish cassoulet. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the saucisse de Toulouse, which also finds its way into their version of cassoulet of Toulouse. The Cahors area produces a specialty "black wine" as well as truffles and mushrooms. </p>
<p> This region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized ewe's milk is used to produce the Roquefort in Aveyron, while in Laguiole is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The Salers cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.[10]:313 Cabécou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy. This area is one of the region's oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats. </p>
<p> Restaurants are popular in the area known as Le Midi. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and Sète. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of Sète, Bourride, Tielles and Rouille de seiche. In the Languedoc jambon cru, sometimes known as jambon de montagne is produced. High quality Roquefort comes from the brebis (sheep) on the Larzac plateau. The Les Cévennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, pâtés and goat cheeses. Catalan influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a purée of dried cod wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific Catalan style known as a cargolade. Wild boar can be found in the more mountainous regions of the Midi.[10]:349,360 </p>
<p> The Provence and Côte d'Azur region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits and herbs; the region is one of the largest suppliers of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf.[15] Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert,[16] e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse. </p>
<p> Rice is grown in the Camargue, which is the northernmost rice growing area in Europe, with Camargue red rice being a specialty.[10]:387,403,404,410,416 Anibal Camous, a Marseillais who lived to be 104, maintained that it was by eating garlic daily that he kept his "youth" and brilliance. When his eighty-year-old son died, the father mourned: "I always told him he wouldn't live long, poor boy. He ate too little garlic!" (cited by chef Philippe Gion) </p>
<p> Goats and sheep proliferate on the island of Corsica, and lamb are used to prepare dishes such as "stufato", ragouts and roasts. Cheeses are also produced, with "brocciu" being the most popular. Chestnuts, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and polenta. The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and boars that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including coppa (dried rib cut), lonzu (dried pork fillet), figatella, salumu (a dried sausage) salcietta, Panzetta, bacon, figatellu (smoked and dried liverwurst) and prisuttu (farmer's ham). Clementines (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied citron is used in nougats, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including Cap Corse, Patrimonio, Cédratine, Bonapartine, liqueur de myrte, vins de fruit, Rappu, and eau-de-vie de châtaigne.[10]:435,441,442 </p>
<p> French Guianan cuisine or Guianan cuisine is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in French Guiana. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as Cayenne, Kourou and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. Many indigenous animal species such as caiman and tapir are used in spiced stews. </p>
<p> French cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities. </p>
<p> With the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned hypermarché, these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. Crayfish, for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.[17] Moreover, they do not freeze well. </p>
<p> French regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as pomme de terre (potato), blé (wheat), haricots verts (a type of French green bean), carotte (carrot), poireau (leek), navet (turnip), aubergine (eggplant), courgette (zucchini), and échalotte (shallot). </p>
<p> Eggs are fine quality and often eaten as: omelettes, hard-boiled with mayonnaise, scrambled plain, scrambled haute cuisine preparation, œuf à la coque. </p>
<p> Fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets. </p>
<p> Le petit déjeuner (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of tartines (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes brioche), along with café au lait (also called "café crème"), or black coffee, or tea[18] and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink hot chocolate in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. Croissants, pain aux raisins or pain au chocolat (also named chocolatine in the south of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in cafés opening early in the day. </p>
<p> There are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is "le petit déjeuner gaulois" or "petit déjeuner fermier" with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or boiled ham, called mouillettes,[19] which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink. </p>
<p> Another variation called "le petit déjeuner chasseur", meant to be very hearty, is served with pâté and other charcuterie products. A more classy version is called "le petit déjeuner du voyageur", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or croque-monsieur, with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the croque-monsieur, it is called a croque-madame. </p>
<p> In Germinal and other novels, Émile Zola also reported the briquet: two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a "second" one before lunch. </p>
<p> In the movie Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis, Philippe Abrams (Kad Merad) and Antoine Bailleul (Dany Boon) share together countless breakfasts consisting of tartines de Maroilles (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory. </p>
<p> Le déjeuner (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family.[20] Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30 pm. Some restaurants are closed on Monday during lunch hours.[21] </p>
<p> In large cities, a majority of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serves complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch to eat. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three courses of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, is eating sandwiches followed by a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at budget prices. </p>
<p> Le dîner (dinner) often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta.[20]:82 Restaurants often open at 7:30 pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.[21]:342 </p>
<p> In French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called apéritifs (literally: that opens the appetite), and can be served with amuse-bouches (literally: mouth amuser). Those that end it are called digestifs. </p>
<p> Apéritifs </p>
<p> The apéritif varies from region to region: Pastis is popular in the south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is replaced with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat. </p>
<p> A typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and foie gras. The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.[22][23][24][25] </p>
<p> The modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to "dine out" would visit their local guild member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them.[26]:8–10 These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal table d'hôte, which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.[26]:30–31 </p>
<p> The first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered restorative bouillons, or restaurants – these words being the origin of the name "restaurant". This step took place during the 1760s–1770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had "lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests."[26]:34–35 </p>
<p> In 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, pastry chef to the future Louis XVIII, opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time – the Grande Taverne de Londres – in the arcades of the Palais-Royal. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France, in the period leading up to the French Revolution. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the French Directory's nouveau riche helped keep these new restaurants in business.[26]:140–144 </p>
<p> More than 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus. Open at certain times of the day, and normally closed one day of the week. Patrons select items from a printed menu. Some offer regional menus, while others offer a modern styled menu. Waiters and waitresses are trained and knowledgeable professionals. By law, a prix-fixe menu must be offered, although high-class restaurants may try to conceal the fact. Few French restaurants cater to vegetarians. The Guide Michelin rates many of the better restaurants in this category.[10]:30 </p>
<p> Often smaller than a restaurant and many times using chalk board or verbal menus. Wait staff may well be untrained. Many feature a regional cuisine. Notable dishes include coq au vin, pot-au-feu, confit de canard, calves' liver and entrecôte.[10]:30 </p>
<p> Bistrot à Vin </p>
<p> Similar to cabarets or tavernes of the past in France. Some offer inexpensive alcoholic drinks, while others take pride in offering a full range of vintage AOC wines. The foods in some are simple, including sausages, ham and cheese, while others offer dishes similar to what can be found in a bistro.[10]:30 </p>
<p> Found in Lyon, they produce traditional Lyonnaise cuisine, such as sausages, duck pâté or roast pork. The dishes can be quite fatty, and heavily oriented around meat. There are about twenty officially certified traditional bouchons, but a larger number of establishments describing themselves using the term.[27] </p>
<p> These establishments were created in the 1870s by refugees from Alsace-Lorraine. These establishments serve beer, but most serve wines from Alsace such as Riesling, Sylvaner, and Gewürztraminer. The most popular dishes are choucroute and seafood dishes.[10]:30 In general, a brasserie is open all day every day, offering the same menu.[28] </p>
<p> Primarily locations for coffee and alcoholic drinks. Additional tables and chairs are usually set outside, and prices are usually higher for service at these tables. The limited foods sometimes offered include croque-monsieur, salads, moules-frites (mussels and pommes frites) when in season. Cafés often open early in the morning and shut down around nine at night.[10]:30 </p>
<p> These locations are more similar to cafés in the rest of the world. These tearooms often offer a selection of cakes and do not offer alcoholic drinks. Many offer simple snacks, salads, and sandwiches. Teas, hot chocolate, and chocolat à l'ancienne (a popular chocolate drink) offered as well. These locations often open just prior to noon for lunch and then close late afternoon.[10]:30 </p>
<p> Based on the American style, many were built at the beginning of the 20th century (particularly around World War I, when young American expatriates were quite common in France, particularly Paris). These locations serve cocktails, whiskey, pastis and other alcoholic drinks.[10]:30 </p>
<p> Estaminet </p>
<p> Typical of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, these small bars/restaurants used to be a central place for farmers, mine or textile workers to meet and socialize, sometimes the bars would be in a grocery store.[29] Customers could order basic regional dishes, play boules, or use the bar as a meeting place for clubs.[30] These estaminets almost disappeared, but are now considered a part of Nord-Pas-de-Calais history, and therefore preserved and promoted. </p>

<p> Fried lamb chops </p>
<p> Filippo shares his grandmother’s easy recipe for fried lamb chops, a classic Easter recipe hailing from Bologna. Perfect for a quick family meal, they can be cooked and on the table in just 30 minutes. </p>
<p> hide story show story </p>
<p> Breaded lambs chops remind me of my childhood. I can still see my granny coating the meat in the egg and cream mixture. I can hear the sizzle of the oil as she drops the meat in the saucepan, and smell the fragrance of frying chops. I could never get bored of this dish, It is a feast for the senses. The lamb is encased in a wonderful golden crust, the lemon adds a hit of sour flavour and best of all – you can eat them with your hands! </p>

<p> 3 </p>
<p> Place the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Dredge the lamb chops in the flour, then the egg mixture and finally the breadcrumbs </p>

<p> Growing up, we rarely used jarred tomato sauce because we always made our own homemade spaghetti sauce. Because I was young, I never thought anything of it. But when I had pasta at a friend's house and they used jarred sauce, I never liked it much. My dad was generally the one who always made our sauce; it was one of his favorite things to do on Sunday afternoons. </p>
<p> This homemade spaghetti sauce recipe was passed down from my Sicilian grandma. It has been used for generations and you can't mess it up! It is really easy and tastes SO much better than the store bought sauce. You can do this in a crockpot too – in fact it is one of our favorite dump recipes. </p>
<p> If you plan to can this sauce, omit the Parmesan cheese and add that when you warm up the sauce before eating. We often add ground beef or italian sausage to it as well (the one pictured has ground beef in it). This just makes it that much better! </p>
<p> If you love this homemade spaghetti sauce recipe, you will love some of our other Italian Recipes: </p>
<p> In fact, you can find many of these recipes in our ALDI Meal Plans, where we teach you how to make 20 meals for under $160 in under 3 hours! </p>
<p> NOTE: If using fresh tomatoes: </p>
<p> You can make this sauce with either cans of crushed tomatoes or fresh tomatoes. If using fresh tomatoes, you would need about 12-15 medium sized tomatoes. There is definitely more work involved when using fresh tomatoes, but it is worth it! </p>
<p> First, you will need to get the skins off. The easiest method for this is to score the skins with a sharp knife, and then boil them for about a minute and then place in cold water.You will want to do this in batches. </p>
<p> Once you the tomatoes have cooled, the skins should peel off relatively easily. Then chop them up, and blend in a food processor. You can control how chunky or smooth you want the sauce by how long you blend them for. </p>
<p> Once this step is done, follow the rest of the recipe using the tomatoes you just prepared as the crushed tomatoes. We hope you enjoy it! </p>
<p> Here is my family spaghetti sauce recipe passed down from my grandmother in Italy - it is the best one you will ever cook - don't trust me - try it! </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 3-4 cans of Crushed Tomatoes (either regular or with basil, oregano and garlic) 28 oz. sized cans OR 12-15 fresh tomatoes (peeled, chopped and blended in a food processor) </p>
<p> Heat the olive oil in a 5+ qt. pot over medium heat, and add the onion. </p>
<p> Saute for 10 minutes or so, stirring often and being careful not to burn it. </p>
<p> Add the chopped or pressed garlic. </p>
<p> Heat for another one to two minutes, making sure not to burn the garlic, then add all the tomatoes, black pepper, basil and sugar. Stirring often, bring to a low boil. </p>
<p> Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours stirring often. </p>
<p> For the first half of the simmer time, do so with the pot uncovered, then cover. </p>
<p> Add the cheese, stir in and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or so. </p>
<p> This will make the equivalent to 4-5 jars of sauce, and the cost is probably about half (and it tastes way better). </p>

<p> You don’t need to can it, but you can if you want to (no pun intended). You can keep it in the freezer in a container for awhile and by awhile I mean like a year. You’ll probably use it up by then. I’m half Italian and my mom (full Italian, R.I.P.) did this every week or two for a good 60 years or so, no problems whatsoever. Also I think it tastes better once it is frozen and thawed, believe it or not. Good luck! </p>
<p> My wife and I are proficient “canners”. When we “can” we do at least 40 cans of various tomato sauces, salsa or other vegetables. We do not can spaghetti sauce every season. But our batch of sauce is fine after sitting on a dark shelf in the cool basement for over a year. Same with our salsa or any of our pickled beets, corn relish, pickled mushrooms etc. </p>
<p> I tried this sauce last week. My family loved it, so easy to make. Thank you for sharing it. </p>
<p> Can you add meat to it? </p>
<p> Just made your sauce for my wife’s work pot luck tomorrow. So good so easy.. thank you… I added some wine.. to deepen the flavor. It’s going to be a hit with the Italian sausages and pasta.. thank you.. </p>
<p> I just followed this recipe perfectly. I’m very disappointed in this sauce. It does not stick to the noodles at all. I used fresh tomatoes and everything else exactly. I’m confused how anyone would consider this to be a good pasta sauce. I was so looking forward to trying this but unfortunately not very impressed. </p>
<p> Just goes to show you that jerks lurk in all places. I have made this sauce, and think it is excellent. No processed foods, salts, preservatives added, 100% healthy </p>
<p> Thank you so much, I don’t eat sugar and I have been looking for a recipe for awhile, I will be trying this weekend </p>
<p> There must be 80 million grandmothers that live in Sicily. When it comes time to cook pasta and sauce, everyone has a family recipe handed down from there grandma, lol… </p>
<p> I’m Italian. My grandmother (Nonna) grew up in Northern Italy..and I agree with Rich. He did not sound angry to me..just truthful. I make my Nonna’s spaghetti sauce recipe. It takes me 2 days to make my homemade spaghetti sauce. And..I could definitely open an Italian restaurant with my sauce. I cannot give away all of my secrets but I will give away a few. I slow roast green & red peppers over an open flame..before they go in my sauce. I never use sugar..only a certain red wine for sweetening. And, if the tomatoes are tart..adding 2 fresh carrots cut into 2″ pieces will reduce the acid. I use tomato paste..in addition to diced tomatoes. I stew my diced tomatoes with my secret seasonings (one of them being a hint of mint). And, I brown my tomato paste slowly..until it is quite dark. I never use ground beef. My sauce always has homemade meatballs, hot Italian sausage, and any pieces of pork..my favorite pork to put in my sauce is whole pork hocks, or a large chunk of salt pork. If you use salt pork, you might not need any additional salt..but taste to be sure. Anyway, making spaghetti sauce has always been a major project in my family..and it’s well worth the effort. Does that sound any better Rich? </p>
<p> BUT….most of us don’t have 2 day to make sauce. This is a quick and easy alternative to store bought sauce and with a little love turns out amazing! And rich is a dick…this sauce is 1000 times better than anything you can buy in a store! Paired with my meatballs I could sale this anywhere!! And by the “the love” i added 4 extra cloves of garlic in the sauce ( not cooked with the onion ) and an extra heaping table spoon of sugar. Sweet is sweet it doesn’t matter if you get it from a sweet red wine or sugar. Excellent recipe!! </p>
<p> If you think your sauce is superior why don’t you have your own blog? </p>
<p> Thank you Sandyjeanie! Sounds so good I am going to steal your recipe and make it my own family tradition. Since you left some mystery in seasoning – I wondered if you ever use saffron? </p>
<p> what the name of the red wine you used? is it lambruso red ty I had a friend from the early 1970 and they put a sweet red wine in the sauce but i cannot remember maybe if you can help i would appericate it ty rose </p>
<p> I agree with Sandy and her sauce is the closest to my grandparents recipes. My dad is full blooded italian and honestly Sandy is the 1st blog I came across where they actually brown the tomato paste. My grandma always said that was they key to a good sauce. Also, both sides of my dads family cook their sauce slightly different. One side added sugar and the other didn’t, but their sauce was more spicy. Now I do not cook my sauce for 2 days, but it does cook all day. </p>
<p> My Nana grew up in Northern Italy too and were not taught that a simple sauce is best. In fact…reading how you make your sauce, you weren’t either! So how did you come to the conclusion that Rich was right when you you wrote a paragraph rebuking everything he said? I don’t know about your Nonna…but my Nana would throw the pan of sauce out in the sink if I made it “simple” with Rich’s ingredients! </p>
<p> You know, any good cook knows that making a good sauce means less than an hr of cooking time because it gets acid and will taste bitter. A great sauce is made with at least 15 ingredients and let sit over night to mature. This is just another “me too” sauce that will be bland and eat your stomach out. </p>
<p> that’s why you add a bit of sugar to combat that acidicness to it </p>
<p> There are as many tomato sauces as there are hairs on your head.,the quick sauce , just olive oil garlic and tomatoes simmers in 30 minutes to the Sunday Gravy which has pigs feet, , ribs, braciole, sausage and meatballs and cooks three hours. It would be good to share some techniques we have learned to help novice cooks. My mom used whole onions in all her soups and sauces. She didn’t like bits and pieces of onion floating in the sauce.It requires the longer cooking sauces . In her easy quick sauces she sauteed the garlic whole or chopped in oil then threw it away. . No bits of garlic either.The garlic infused oil was great.We never used virgin oil , it was too strongly flavored and over powered the dish.Meatballs were made with a panade , a mixture of four or five pieces of bread soaked in water or milk . It was thought to make lighter meatballs.Incidentally, I order my tomatoes ,called Six in One from California online .They are canned in the field and like Ed Giobbi said even the Italian imported tomatoes are not good anymore. These are darn good and inexpensive. </p>
<p> Sugar bro? Stick to your store bought Ragu crap then. Some people actually know what they’re doing. </p>
<p> I have to agree. I followed the directions 100% and was not impressed with the taste? </p>
<p> I’m making it now and so far I love it. Very fresh and clean tasting not over burdened with a lot of spices. Just what I was looking for . I can add my meats and meatballs if I want more flavor but I like starting with a good base that can stand alone if you don’t want to add meats. </p>
<p> I buy the 102 ounces of Italian tomatoes/ How much garlic , basil and onions would you put in that? </p>
<p> I love it! I added seasoned hamburger and hot Italian Sauage and red and green bell peppers. YUM!!!!! </p>
<p> I know this sauce is delicious ! Because this is the same as I’ve made it for 40years. I make it adding ground chuck and I also like basil in the sauce!! But other than that it’s the same… </p>
<p> I store in a tupperware container and we either eat it that week, or I freeze it in Ziploc bags. </p>
<p> The ! gallon freezer bags work great for me. I fill them each 1/3 to 1/2 full then fold out all of the extra air. Then I put them in a container after they cool off so they can freeze into thin bricks that stack nicely later. The thin configuration helps with faster defrosting later. </p>
<p> Mmm…that recipe sounds great! I bet that grated cheese really makes it. Hunts is one of my favorite brands and the only canned tomato sauce that I will use. I like to use it as a base for pizza sauce and enchilada sauce. </p>
<p> if jen likes it- why comment, I’m curious- i don’t like reading comments that make other people feel bad 🙁 </p>
<p> How do you taste the metal can. Cans have a lining so the tomatos never come into contact with the metal in the can. If you have a metallic taste in your tomatoes it’s not the can. Just cheap processing. </p>
<p> Delicious! I added 1 large sweet onion whole and a pack of boneless ribs and about 3/4 lb of ground beef. I cooked it in the slow cooker from 9-3, then transferred it to the pot to cook down and threw in a little tomato paste. The onion falls apart as it cooks. At 3, I took it out and chopped it tiny and put it back in. If you add in the whole onion and ribs, it gets this sweet taste like it has seafood in it. After I transferred it to the pot, I tasted it. It was a little tart so I added a little baking soda, let it sit a little and retasted it. Perfect. </p>
<p> Baking soda takes the acid out of the tomato’s. So if you know someone that gets heartburn after eating a tomato based meal try baking soda. </p>
<p> So will a little lemon juice. </p>
<p> If you plan on canning your sauce you must add lemon juice or citric acid. To increase the acidity. And if you want to can your sauce never put Sodium Bicarbonate ( baking soda ) in it. You can kill people that way. </p>
<p> lemon juice is acid so it won’t take acid out, baking soda has base ph so it will neutralize acid. if you want to add a bit of sweetness without the sugar, place a whole peeled carrot in the pot, not only will it balance the acid in the tomatoes, but it will remove the canned taste if you are using tomatoes in a can. </p>
<p> I grate a medium carrot which sweetens the sauce without the cloying sweetness of added sugar. </p>
<p> I do that as well and, the carrots really make a difference. Kim </p>
<p> I didn’t remove the seeds and regretted it. Looks like salsa. Lol. Next time I will remove the seeds. I also added tomato paste to help thicken the sauce. </p>
<p> Trey, there are recipe trolls on every post. Some do not understand that pork is not eaten by all. If you want to add pork or beef, add it but do not be critical. </p>
<p> There is nothing “authentic” about adding pork to “Italian sauce.” And by “Italian,” I believe that you mean ITALIAN AMERICAN, which is something different. </p>
<p> When they arrived here, Italians used what they could afford, and often in much larger quantities than they ever had before. Every cook was, and is, different. </p>
<p> Absolutely correct every cook is different my uncle Dominick cook his sauce from scratch my grand mother use to make pasta noodles home made put both their receips together and and knock bones and home made Meat balls boy did we have a heck of a meal and don’t forget the salad we had so much food we had enough to feed an army or two </p>
<p> Lemmon juice ADDS Acidity! Baking soda removes Acidity! Kim below got it wrong. </p>
<p> Do not use to much baking soda. This is not a cake! </p>
<p> This is a starter sauce for use in recipes that follow later. At least that is what I use it for. </p>
<p> My mother-in-law is authentic Italian, she always put in pork ribs and chicken backs into her “gravy”. She cooked it for 2 days. </p>

<p> I do not understand how you could get 6 jars from this recipe. Recipe. Confusing It first says 3/4 crushed tomatoes then all. This looks good but no instructions on adding meat or sausage. There is no way this would be 6 jars. Did I miss something </p>
<p> 3-4 means 3 or 4 cans of tomatoes 3/4 means three quarters of a can. Maybe that will help? </p>
<p> I really don’t see how it would make 6 jars either, unless they are very small jars. I made this to use with my Manicotti yesterday, I only used “half” of everything as it was my first time making it and didn’t know whether the family would like it and didn’t want extra. My Manicotti recipe called for a 26oz jar of sauce and I barely had enough. I would say this recipe would make maybe 2-3 average size jars (24-26oz) of sauce. Though I can see it making 6 jars of the smaller sauce jars, like 16-18 oz jars. Still yummy though! </p>
<p> Re. the homemade Italian spaghetti sauce recipe, and it being a favorite “dump-recipe”: How do the directions change when using the crockpot, as opposed to in the pan ,(which is how the website instructions read,)? Also, what meats (hamburger and/or sausage ? Pre-cooked or raw? Are ground chicken or turkey or turkey sausages possibilities ? ) and meat quantities are used for a batch of this size ? Thx. </p>
<p> In a crackpot recipe, you lightly brown the hamburger and sausage mix (with the Italian herbs in it) in a 2 -3 quart pan leave it partially red from cooking the lump of meat mix and break it up at at the bottom of the crackpot and then dump the rest of the sauce ingredients in and set the crokpot to go and over that time the meat will cook with the sauce. You brown it to envelope the flavors together and cook the meat a bit. It all finishes in the crockpot with the addition of other flavors and the final cooking of the sauce and meat. </p>
<p> Becoming a vegan at 64 years of age is a bit tough. But what is great is I found this wonderful simple sauce! I’m making it again for the third time. The only thing I add is majoram and when the pan is very hot while sauteing the onions and garlic, I add a little red wine. Thank you for the sauce recipe. I love it because I can adapt it to my palate! Happy New Year! </p>
<p> Lauren i am really excited to try this recipe. Any canning suggestions or have you tried canning this? </p>
<p> No, what’s matter you! Gravy is what you put on mashed potatoes or turkey! What you put on spaghetti is called “SAUCE “ </p>
<p> You are both wrong.. Any sauce which contains meat, is called and referred to as “gravy”. If your sauce doesn’t contain any meat, then its called sauce – hence marinara sauce. </p>
<p> I believe it is called gravy on the East Coast. The rest of the country calls in spaghetti sauce. </p>

<p> I learned a similar recipe from my mother. Some things to try: </p>
<p> My mother taught me to add three primary ingredients (holy trinity) chopped/minced garlic, chopped onion, and chopped pepper.) I wonder if the onion is a Scottish thing (mom was born and raised in Glasgow, but worked for five years for an Italian family restaurant). </p>
<p> Like the recipe says, the key is creating a base by sauteing the first ingredients at a low to medium heat in olive oil. </p>
<p> I use only San Marzano canned tomatoes from Italy… I was told by an Italian friend that they are less acidic… Unless I get some good fresh tomatoes of course. </p>
<p> i also add fresh basil leaves, lightly chopped towards the end of the simmer. </p>
<p> I think it is best to make the day before you serve.. that lets the flavors blend. </p>
<p> I never measure the seasonings… I add a little at a time until it tastes “right” </p>
<p> That is not the “Holy Trinity”. Carrots, celery, and onion is the “Holy Trinity” of Italian cooking. </p>
<p> That “holy trinity” is used in many cultures for a base for many sauces, soups & stews. Try watching real cooks on some cooking shows. That’s how I start all of mine, been Cooking for 60 years now, & still love getting new ideas from the pro’s. PS: also get a kick out of the ” Snotty ” remarks from some of you self righteous people out there, LOL!, K </p>
<p> Do you have a recipe for a much smaller batch? I do not have freezer space or equipment to store the sauce in jars. </p>
<p> When my husband and I visited Italy a few years back, we had the privilege of eating spaghetti cooked by our Italian chef friend that was out of this world delicious and was the exact recipe that Lauren’s grandmother passed down to her. It is not the thick pasty tomatoey glob that overpowers American spaghetti so you can’t taste anything else. You can call it gravy or whatever you please…I call it fantastic and tasteful. I am so glad Lauren shared her culinary treasure!!! Love, Love, Love it!!!! </p>
<p> I agree with you,call it what you wish so I will be making this gravy because I want to try something different.I will be serving it to my trashy husband who will call it good I am sure. </p>
<p> I have to agree .I love it too .Simple and clean tasting. I haven’t made sauce in a long time and actually forgot how much I put of what. It used to come naturally of knowing how much. I Just for forgot however I didn’t forget how to make my meatballs TG.Now that I’m older I was looking for something with less spices and fresher tasting. This fit the bill. </p>
<p> Thank you for this incredible recipe! I made this sauce for a spaghetti night with friends, and than used the remainder for a large batch of lasagna. Everyone raved about the flavor, and asked for the recipe. It’s incredibly delicious, and so easy to make. This URL is being bookmarked for eternity! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! </p>
<p> Sounds great gonna try it Sunday My Sunday wouldent be complete without spaghetti dinner. But always used jar sauce So I want something more tastier How much ground beef or Italian sausage do you recommend for this recipe? One other thing is I read some negative posts about the recipe. That wasn’t nice when you took the time to share a family recipe Thank you. </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing! It’s somewhat similar to my grandmother’s sauce however with a few American twists, as she called it. She and my grandfather moved to the Brooklyn from Southern Italy in the 1950’s. The American twists in her sauce being oregano and onions, which she had added to her mother’s recipe. </p>
<p> My napoletan grandma added onion to the gravy my Sicilian grandma never did. I prefer without the onion never peppers. The basic recipe is the same brown the garlic in olive oil , add crushed tomatoes I like Cento , or tuttorosa or any imported from Italy they seem less watery, of course you can crush regular whole tomatoes as well. If you want meat sauce I add a few Italian and hot sausage, meatballs and porky ribs , sometimes a piece of steak, first add the tomatoes I use 4 or 5 cans to the lightly browned garlic stir let simmer 20 minutes, then add 20 oz can tomatoe sauce I like del monte or red pack stir add 2 tablespoons of sugar, salt, pepper, I use fresh basil leaves, stir let simmer 15 minutes then I add the meats you can just throw in they will cook in sauce, I used to brown meats first in tomatoe paste and garlic which adds more flavor , drain and then add to sauce need extra time for that. Let cook 3 to 4 hours on low stirring occasionally I always leave uncovered until last 45 minutes to thicken. This makes a lot so you always have leftover freeze in Tupperware . </p>
<p> Can’t wait to try. Am going to make a day ahead. and I will be adding meatballs towards the end. Been craving this!! </p>
<p> its called sauce everywhere but down south there its called gravy they put on everything </p>
<p> I have a quick question, how much green pepper should be added? Also, should it be added in the 2nd step along with all the other ingredients? Thank you very much in advance for your help! </p>
<p> Hi Linda. When I use green pepper, I use probably about 1/3 of a green pepper and dice it into very small pieces. Then I saute it with the onion. Hope that helps! </p>
<p> I found your recipe on the Internet back in August of 2015 and have been using it ever since, best Spaghetti sauce recipe I’ve ever made or tasted. Of course I doctor it up but the base is your recipe. Thanks for sharing. </p>
<p> As an Italian restaurant owner for 50 years, spaghetti sauce is called sugo. Your receipt is pretty close to mine…simple and rich. The secret is in the humidity for the day. Longer if damp, but shorter and lower temp when dry, you can not rush flavor! Also sugo is better when it sets for a least 5 days (use stainless steel or glass). Freezing make is thick and rich. </p>
<p> Made this last night. Made a few changes (extra basil, sugar, onions, green pepper, mushrooms, chicken, and a little tomato paste to thicken). I love this recipe! Definitely my new go to recipe. Fed my husband and my neighbor. Both loved it. </p>
<p> Thanks, everybody — I always use ground beef (part sirloin) in spaghetti sauce. I brown it in a large pan and thereafter add everything else that’s going in the sauce. I don’t use onions, but just onion powder. (Somebody in my house doesn’t like “real” onions.) I generally use Tuttaroso canned sauce, but any other will do fine. Use lots of spices — your choice — and cook slowly, for at least an hour to blend everything. Delicious! </p>
<p> How/what can I do to the ground beef as sometimes it has no or little taste (especially when I make chili)??? </p>
<p> Very similar to recipe my Italian friends mother gave me years ago. She adds a splash of burgundy or other red wine. Adds Wow factor! I never use canned/jarred sauce. When hubby 1st tasted my home-made sauce he thought he had died and gone to Heaven! His mother, like mine, used a BOX mix! Ugh Ugh!! Always swore I would never use it, only home-made. </p>
<p> Similar to my family’s recipe (came from italy in 1900) – but is that a metal pot? Never use any reactive pan w/ anything w/ tomatoes (you will get a metallic taste!). Don’t cover w/ foil unless you make sure the foil does not touch the tomatoes or sauce (you will end up w/ foil melted into your recipe). Thanks for sharing the recipe! </p>
<p> This is how I make mine and it keeps very well in the freezer. This gives me something to do with all my tomatoes from my garden and all the oregano and basil I have. I just stew them down all day and add everything else a couple hours before I think it is ‘saucy’ enough. …. and yes i cut my tomatoes in half and squeeze the seeds out. </p>
<p> my daughter and I made this and it was awful. it was watery though we followed your recipe to the letter. (we used tomatoes) we were hoping for a richer sauce with flavor, not so runny. we were very disappointed. Very. </p>
<p> If you follow the recipe with fresh tomatoes it does get really runny and watery. I figured out to add a can of tomato paste to it when you start it in the crock pot in the morning or when you add the tomatoes to the pot if you are cooking on the stove. </p>
<p> If you are using fresh tomatoes yuo have to use a very meaty tomato such as a Roma, seed and squeeze most of the juice out. Same if you are makng salsa or ketchup. Tomatoes are so full of water that you can’t use a regular canning tomato or garden tomatoefor a rich sauce. Don’t give up, this is really a very good recipe and I am very picky about my pasta sauce reccomendations </p>
<p> I have been making Italian sauces fior many years. Most of my recipes were learned from the mother of a dear friend while I was on an extended visit to Italia. This recipe reminds me so much of one herss and it was always one of my favorites. I did use a cup of dry red wine, fresh basil and fresh oregano. I use raw honey instead of sugar. I made this exactly by your recipe for my first batch and everyone thought it was great. I made the few changes just because it was what I was used to. One last note. Mama Tre would put two whole carrots iin the pot the last hour of cooking, she said it added to the sweetness and soaked up the tomato acid. I do tjis with many tomato dishes and they don’t seem to be as acidic. You toss the carrots by the way. Thank you for the lovely recipe, this saves many steps from Mama Tres original. </p>
<p> Just made your sauce tonight! So delicious!!!! Exactly what I was looking for. Simplicity at it’s best! My husband who is not a big fan of Spaghetti absolutely loved it! </p>
<p> Trying to copy the recipe but something is preventing me from doing it. If you had an email version you could send would be great, thank you. </p>
<p> There is a little envelope at bottom right of the page.This will allow you to send the recipe to yourself. </p>
<p> I made this with Romano tomatoes from the garden. I blended them in my Vitamix, no need to peel. I also added a can of tomatoes paste to thicken it up. It turned out great! </p>
<p> Did you leave the seeds in when using fresh tomatoes? I did and am worried I ruined it! Thanks! </p>
<p> I like the sounds of your recipe all the way through and I’m going to give it a try today the only thing I would add is it after the tomatoes are cooled before you peel off the skin hold them over the sink and give them one quick firm squeeze this shoots out all the extra water and 95% of the seeds. </p>
<p> HELP!!! I’m making the sauce now and I to find it rather water/runny. I realize I should have used roma (?) tomatoes? so… now that I’m almost through cooking the sauce – what can I do to rectify the runny/watery issue? I’m not a cook at all.. .I eat, believe me, but rushing home to turn on the stove has just never been my passion. I retired a week ago and my first task was to make home made spaghetti sauce… recipe looks great and I’m sure it will taste great but… what do I do now???? help. thank you Karen </p>
<p> I would turn the temperature up and try to boil some of the water off. Watch it close and stir frequently so that you don’t burn it. </p>
<p> Just made this for my husband and me….it was awesome! Added 2 pounds of lean ground beef. Excellent sauce! Simple and yummy. We are having leftovers tomorrow, and I was able to put away enough sauce in the freezer for another meal or two. Thanks! </p>
<p> I never made sauce before and followed your recipe, added a little of my own touch and it came out amazing, thank you so much. I a very picky about sauce and most does give me heart burn from others this was perfect! </p>
<p> I’m excited to try this. But I feel kind of dumb asking for clarification…do you mean green chili, or bell peppers? </p>
<p> Michelle, bell peppers. I’m going to try this recipe this week, but will skip the peppers </p>
<p> I’ve been looking for this recipe for several years. An older friend who grew up in Sicily told me how to make it a long time ago. Thought I’d remember with so few ingredients. Forgot before I had a chance to make it. Making it tonight. Thank you thank you. Can’t wait to try it. </p>
<p> The flavor was off and it was too watery. I used whole tomatoes from a can. Please help!!! </p>
<p> The problem was that you used whole tomatoes. The recipe calls for crushed tomatoes. </p>
<p> This recipe is fantastic! I make mine without the sugar and cheese and it’s tastier than any sauce I’ve ever had. I use Muir Glen organic for the tomatoes in mine which adds even more flavor. Thanks for sharing your recipe. </p>
<p> I have used Hunts in the past and, well, not the best taste. So, I made this recipe with Cento San Marzano whole tomatoes that I pulsed in the blender for one second. I also address a 6 oz can of tomato paste. Turns out to be delicious! </p>
<p> I did brown my meatballs in the pot first and left the oil/browned bits to start the sauce. </p>
<p> Hi Lauren, thanks for sharing your family’s recipe. It sounds delicious and I’m going to make a batch shortly! 🙂 One note–I’m sure you don’t want to make anyone sick, but it’s not safe to can just any recipe (even if you’ve been doing it for years with no problem). There are three sources of scientifically tested safe home canning recipes: the Ball and Bernardin companies (they make the canning jars) and the National Center for Home Food Preservation. If your recipe hasn’t been tested, it’s not considered safe to can (and all tested recipes that contain meat must be pressure-canned.) Canning creates the perfect conditions for growing botulinum bacteria, which create an odorless, colorless toxin that is extremely deadly. Just a couple of years ago, home-canned food killed one person and sent 23 to the hospital here in Ohio. Spaghetti sauce freezes beautifully (and I personally think it tastes fresher when frozen instead of canned anyway.) Thanks again for sharing your family lore. </p>
<p> Excellent recipe! Only “additions” I made was to use a whole onion (small) and a tablespoon of crushed red pepper. Oh and I had some meatballs and sausage links at the beginning. Would highly recommend this! Mmm mmm good! </p>
<p> Amazing sauce! My daughter took the small leftover to school the next day, which is a rare occasion and a high level of praise :D. I shifted dry basil with fresh and used some of the water from boiling the fresh tomatoes to make it a bit “thiner”, because I had to pick up a kid in the proces and had to make sure it didn´t burn. besides that i made some crispy bacon to drizzle on top and a spinach and fresh plum salad :)..The sauce tasted simple and amazing! Thank You for sharing!!!! 😀 </p>
<p> I have the sauce cooking now . It seems very thick with another hour to go I am hoping that it will become more of a sauce not a glop of tomatoes I’m also going to add meatballs to it & may end up adding a little wine to smooth it out </p>
<p> Sicilian nana only used wine, ok, homemade Chianti, after dinner- FYI squeezed fresh tomatoes in her hand! What a great cook Her sister’s son is Jimmy Stolfe. CONNIE’s Pizza. MMM good Sunday dinners at Nana’ s. THANKYOU FOR THE RECIPE. But we left out one important ingredient! ALL THE LAUGHS AND HAPPY CHATTER. BEST PART OF SUNDAY DINNER BESIDES ANTI PASTA, PASTA, SALAD, DESERT, FRUIT AND CRACKING NUTS, AND, OH YAH, PLAYING CHEVHERS WITH UNCLE SAM, WHILE THE ADULTS CRANKED UP THE MUSIC…Right there and tben, we kids knew – there is no way we will be getting home to finish homework. BUT EBERYBODY WAS HAPPY BACK THEN. </p>
<p> I made your family recipe and my husband and I love loved it. I browned some pork neck bones and sweet Italian sausage with the onion and garlic .. I then added the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for three and a half hours. It was delicious.. Thank you so much for sharing </p>
<p> No oregano? I’m curious, what does oregano do to the sauce? I will be using THIS recipe when my fresh Roma’s come in this summer. </p>
<p> Hi, I read through your recipes today and they are exactly what I have been making for years. My recipe came from a Sicilian family also. My Alfredo recipe came from Marie Callender’s.Incorporating cream cheese into the sauce makes it perfect. I also add a TBL of cooking sherry. Thank you and I look forward to following you new recipes from now on! </p>
<p> Hi Lauren, this is very similar to a base sauce that is in our family for years. I like to call it your “Go To Sauce” something you can count on time and time again. Do you ever use San Marzano tomatoes? </p>
<p> I have to ask. Have you ever put 1 tablespoon of cream cheese in it? My great grandma had that same recipe with cream cheese added. </p>
<p> Lauren, The base sause is absolutely superb When I see no sugar required in the comment section I roll my eyes… a seasoned cook would know that the sugar neutralizes the acid in tomatoes. So many experts in the comment section. Lol….Cooking requires passion to do it well and years of experience to refine the process, but without common sense of basic cooking knowledge you do stupid stuff, like omitting the sugar out of the sauce. </p>
<p> Can I make this in the Slow Cooker? If so how long and should it be on low or high? </p>
<p> Do i need to add anything to it for storing it in jars? This recipe is so easy and delicious. I froze the sauce with the meat but want to her it plain. Is that ok to do? </p>
<p> Started growling my own Tomatoes and I’m now looking for a good recipe to make sauce. </p>
<p> Jesus Christ, this thread. Someone posts their grandma’s recipe, and suddenly every asshole on the internet appears. Anyway, GREAT SAUCE. I love it. Thanks very much for posting it, Lauren. </p>
<p> Oh gosh this is the best sauce I have ever had. I have 7 kids and two of them don’t like spaghetti but can you believe I fixed this and every one of them had seconds. Thank you so much for sharing this with us. I hope everyone just gives it a try. And oh i caned10 jars of it and I put it in a water bath for 20 min and it turned out so pretty. Now keeping all my kids from just eating it out of the jar with a spoon lol. Thanks so much. </p>
<p> Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. I followed all the measurment except for the crushed tomatoes I only used one and half cans. I boiled the sause for like 20 min and then simmered it for a half hour. I added the olive oil at the end. It taste awesome thank you again. Ps I added some onion and garlic powder and a tad bit of oregano </p>
<p> I don’t know why anyone would complain about this recipe. I made it last night with fresh tomatoes and it was absolutely delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!! </p>
<p> One question…how much ground beef for meat sauce. I think this recipe is fabulous! Thank you for sharing!!! </p>
<p> Hi Lauren. I made this spaghetti sauce and it is the best!! I added ground beef and mild Italian sausage. As soon as it started cooking it smelled delicious! We had leftovers for the next day but it was all gone by noon. The family loved it! Thank you for sharing. I’ve been looking for the best spaghetti sauce recipe for years and here it is. </p>
<p> I am not fond of spaghetti or the sauce, but decided to try this one for the family. OMG it was so good that I even had a plate ofspaghetti. Am making a large batch for a family reunion and I know it will be a hit. Thank you and my compliments for sharing a great recipe.! </p>
<p> This recipe has the exact ingredients I use for my own sauce lol! I just prepare it a little differently than your recipe. But it is fabulous and I love it! I HAVE to make meatballs with it though because my youngest son, 25, says it’s not mamas without meatballs! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ </p>
<p> I added a little salt, a little oregano because my puree didnt have any, and I added some red pepper flakes. Even without those red pepper flakes, I know this sauce is delicious. I will be making this again for sure. Very glad I chose this one on my pinterest search. </p>
<p> Wow, I came online to get a great simple red sauce recipe. Wasn’t expecting such a rough crowd! </p>
<p> I’m from over the pond. Fleetwood UK. Am so looking forward to making it today. Am over eighty and have never made spaghetti sauce I’m. Ashamed to say! Have enjoyed all the comments ! Thankyou. Will let you know how I got on. Xx </p>
<p> I made this with fresh tomatoes. I simmered it for 2 days with hamburger and sweet mild sausage. Everyone loved it. I kept the rest for a few days and it was the best sauce. </p>
<p> Hi Lauren Read your recipe for It. Spaghetti sauce, that was handed down from Sicillian Grandma. Can’t wait to try it.! </p>
<p> Thanks for sharing. My mother always added a few bay leaves. I myself LOVE rosemary so I will be adding that in the recipe, maybe some fresh mushrooms also. Our local Italian mom and pops restaurant, who have pictures of their Italian family wedding pictures from the generations gracing their walls, uses soup bones to give it a good flavor, then takes them out. </p>
<p> We are planning on making up a few different recipes to can enough sauce for the whole year! Thanks again for this basic recipe to start with! </p>
<p> What a RIOT, I have been having a great time reading most of all of the comments i wasn’t paying attention and it has been 2 1/2 hrs. Funny how things tend to stray off the subject at hand and into a totally different realm. Im not a great cook yet I am not a bad cook I am a good cook. always like to stroll and see what might be knew or different in a simple recipe. Love it… </p>

<p> I am looking for a new love affair. I want something for frying a whole chicken or several burger patties. I'm done with non-stick. I've had Circulon and Calphalon and the non-stick is coming off. Guess where it went? </p>
<p> When I go to restaurants where I can see into the kitchen, it looks like the pans they're using are stainless or aluminum. These pans must take a beating as they are used over and over all day. </p>
<p> I have cast iron and love it but I would like something a little lighter in weight (I'm not Pop Eye). A helper handle might be nice. I am a little hesitant about aluminum cookware as I was taken in by the Alzheimer's claims...What do the pros do??? </p>

<p> Gordon Ramsay’s Pork Chops with Sweet and Sour Peppers </p>
<p> A Keto version of the legendary Gordon Ramsay recipe </p>
<p> If it isn’t obvious already, I love to eat good food and I enjoy cooking good food too. Over the years many chefs have inspired me and one of those has been Gordon Ramsay. While he might be famous more for his cursing, he’s not one of the best chefs in the world for nothing. His pork chops with sweet and sour peppers is the stuff of legends. This recipe is extremely simple, it’s literally just a few ingredients of top quality, treated perfectly for maximum flavour. I hope I’ve done Gordon proud and I hope you folks enjoy this recipe. </p>
<p> A whole lot of porky goodness </p>
<p> Since I didn’t get the perfect bone in pork chops, I filleted mine and cooked up just the eye or the loin part of it. I plan to use the bones to make a stock and at the end I cooked up the other meat trimmings for a tasty snack. Couple of tips to keep in mind is to cut the fat side of the pork chop with the knife so it doesn’t curl up when cooking and it cooks more evenly. Also once done cooking make sure you save the residual oil in the pan and it can be used for plenty of things in the future. Make sure you also eat that crispy garlic. Anyway, enjoy the recipe. </p>

<p> Grandma’s Cooking Secret </p>
<p> A bride finally questions why her mother cuts the ends off of roasts before cooking them. </p>
<p> Barbara Mikkelson </p>
<p> Published 9 November 1999 </p>
<p> Claim </p>
<p> A bride finally questions why her mother cuts the ends off of roasts before cooking them. </p>
<p> Rating </p>
<p> Legend </p>
<p> Origin </p>
<p> Some family traditions are inexplicable … as one bride supposedly found out when she finally thought to question why cutting off the ends of the roast before cooking the meat made for a better result: </p>
<p> The new Jewish bride is making her first big dinner for her husband and tries her hand at her mother’s brisket recipe, cutting off the ends of the roast the way her mother always did. Hubby thinks the meat is delicious, but says, “Why do you cut off the ends — that’s the best part!” She answers, “That’s the way my mother always made it.” </p>
<p> The next week, they go to the old bubbie’s house, and she prepares the famous brisket recipe, again cutting off the ends. The young bride is sure she must be missing some vital information, so she askes her grandma why she cut off the ends. Grandma says, “Dahlink, that’s the only way it will fit in the pan!” </p>
<p> In this respect, they are as bad as “this old boy down home.” His wife sent him to the store for a ham. After he bought it, she asked him why he didn’t have the butcher cut off the end of the ham. “This old boy” asked his wife why she wanted the end cut off. She replied that her mother had always done it that way and that was reason enough for her. Since the wife’s mother was visiting, they asked her why she always cut off the end of the ham. Mother replied that this was the way her mother did it; Mother, daughter and “this old boy” then decided to call grandmother and solve this three-generation mystery. Grandmother promptly replied that she cut the end of the ham because her roaster was too small to cook it in one piece. </p>
<p> Setting up housekeeping is a daunting yet satisfying task as the bride strives to create a home for herself and her husband, not just a bare-walls place to live. (Grooms appear to be far less motivated in this regard — if it has a TV, sofa, and refrigerator, they figure it’s about as done as it gets.) In creating her nest, it’s assumed the bride will make mistakes early on as she finds out the hard way that what looked so easy when Mom was doing it is a bit more difficult on one’s own. Burnt dinners and tears go together, but eventually a satisfactory homelife is settled into as major purchases are made, redecoration is accomplished, and traditions established within this new family. Throughout the upheaval, the bride is expected to look to her mother for a living example of how to pull it all together and to rely on her advice. </p>
<p> It’s upon this assumption this legend rests. Many of the secrets of being a good cook are counterintuitive, and it’s easy to adopt an “I don’t know how this works, I just know it does” stance as yet another of Mom’s recipes proves to turn out only when certain procedures are rigidly followed. The stage is set, so to speak, for the “too big for the pan” joke. </p>
<p> Often told within the Jewish religion, this tale is a parable for teaching the importance of understanding the whys of religious rituals. It is not enough, says this legend, to perform by rote — if observance is to have value, the reasons behind a tradition have to be appreciated as well as the ritual itself faithfully carried out. What better way to express this concept than by telling a tale of a bride and a trimmed roast? </p>
<p> In 2001, the following version of this classic appeared in the Canadian edition of Reader’s Digest: </p>
<p> When my friend Dale opens a can, she always turns it upside down to open it from the bottom. One day her young son asked her why. “I don’t really know,” she said. “My mom always did it that way.” She decided to call her mom and ask. </p>
<p> “When we brought the cans up from the cellar, the tops were always dusty,” her mother explained. “I couldn’t be bothered to clean them, so I turned them upside down and opened the bottom.” </p>
<p> This account came to us from a reader in 2005: </p>
<p> I was cooking Thanksgiving dinner with my friend who comes from a long line of Black Southern cooks! We were going to cook like 10 different desserts and take them to Grandma’s house for the big day! </p>
<p> Well, with every cake that went into the oven, a pan of water went in too … I didn’t ask him why, while cooking, figuring that surely it was some secret for making the cakes more moist. </p>
<p> He made sure to point this out to his mother when we arrived. She complimented him on his remembering. I am brave enough to ask, in this crowded kitchen, with food laid out for at least 50 people. His grandmother pipes in … </p>
<p> “I used to put a pan of water in there because my racks were uneven.” </p>
<p> In 2003 a reader mailed us an especially enjoyable version of the tale: </p>
<p> A young woman is preparing her first thanksgiving dinner. As she gets everything ready for thanksgiving day, she very sternly reminds herself to let the turkey finish thawing in the sink overnight. She puts it in and places the dishrack over the top of the bird. Her husband walks into the kitchen and sees this. “Why are you doing that?” he asks. </p>
<p> “My mom always did that to help the turkey thaw” she told him. </p>
<p> The next day Mom calls to see how everything is going. “Fine, Ma. I have everything ready to go in the oven. I even remembered to put the rack over the turkey last night.” </p>
<p> This seemed to confuse her mother a bit. “What are you talking about?” she asked. </p>
<p> “Oh, I remember you always put the dish rack over the turkey when it was thawing in the sink,” she said. </p>
<p> There was a pause on the end of the line. “Yes, but honey, we had cats!” </p>
<p> Just to prove it’s not only the ladies who fall into the trap of imitating without understanding, we leave you with this bit of humor from 1958: </p>
<p> A more frightened than injured young Seabee electrician was brought into the hospital suffering from electrical burns. Shortly afterward his instructor, a chief electrician, arrived. “Why on earth didn’t you turn off the main power switch before you tried to splice the wires?” asked the chief. </p>
<p> “I wanted to save time, chief, and I’ve seen you stand on one leg, grab the wires and splice without turning off the power.” </p>
<p> “My God, kid,” exclaimed the chief. “Didn’t you know I have a wooden leg?” </p>
<p> Variations: </p>
<p> In many tellings, the bride emulates her mother’s behavior and her mother is found to be but doing what her mother always did. Bride and mother consult with the grandmother only to discover that Grandma’s “secret” had to do with a too-small roasting pan. Two generations have slavishly followed the tradition without understanding it. </p>
<p> Oftentimes it’s the new husband who insists upon questioning the inexplicable procedure because his wife appears not to care about its mechanics. In her world, that it works is enough; understanding its mystery is beside the point. </p>
<p> Variations of the tale include cutting the bones out of the drumsticks before roasting the turkey or removing the drumsticks and cooking them in a separate pan (the oven was too small to roast the bird intact), cutting two inches off a new broom (short broom closet), always removing the bottom lid of a can (tops were dusty), and fastening balls of cotton onto a new screen door “to keep out the flies” (Mom used to stuff cotton balls into holes in the ancient screen door). </p>
<p> Sightings: This legend surfaces in a 1994 episode of television’s The Commish: Tony Scali asks one of his officers why he makes five copies of each document only to always throw away the fifth and is told “That’s the way we’ve always done it.” In retaliation, the Commish tells the “ends cut off the roast” story. </p>

<p> Grief: Ritual Finger Amputaion </p>
<p> The death of a loved one can be a traumatic experience and causes emotional pain and suffering. However, in some cultures the loss can result in physical pain as well. Certain cultures believe this physical representation of emotional pain is essential to the grieving process. This can be seen in the Dani tribe in Papua, New Guinea. Some tribe members have cut off the top of their finger upon attending a funeral. This ritual is specific to the woman population of the Dani tribe. A woman will cut off the top of her finger if she loses a family member or child. The practice was done to both gratify and drive away the spirits, while also providing a way to use physical pain as an expression of sorrow and suffering. The Dani tribe members have the religious belief that if the deceased were a powerful person while living, their essence would remain in the village in lingering spiritual turmoil. </p>
<p> The practice is performed by first tying a string tightly around the upper half of the finger for about 30 minutes. This allows the finger to become numb for a “near” painless removal. The finger is removed by using an ax and the open sore is cauterized both to prevent bleeding and to form new-calloused fingers. The left over piece of finger is dried and then either burned to ashes or stored in a special place. This ritual is now banned in New Guinea, but the practice can still be seen in some of the older women of the community who have mutilated fingertips. The practice of causing physical pain to show grief and deal with mourning can be seen in a numerous amount of other cultures as well. Cutting arms, legs and body, shaving off hair from the head, and burning skin are rituals used by other cultures during the grieving process. Grieving is a natural response to losing someone and everyone has different ways of dealing with grief. </p>

<p> 3 responses to “Grief: Ritual Finger Amputaion” </p>
<p> I’m very interested as to how this practice served to drive away and gratify spirits and how this manifested in only the women of the community. In Western culture, it seems that we rarely see grief in such an immediate physical form. We expect grief to be mental and emotional as we mourn. Sometimes emotional dependencies mixed with a form of substance abuse become physical affliction, but that pain is a processs over time. By inflicting intense immediate pain, I’m curious how this aids the grieving process. By axing off the fingers, does the death become more finalized? Does the grief period end once the fingers are removed and sacrificed to satisfy spirits? </p>
<p> I always find it interesting to learn about different aspects of cultures. I think that when you learn about others, you learn about your own culture and comforts. In learning about this cultural practice, I found that the idea of cutting off the end of a finger on purpose makes me uncomfortable. I think that my aversion is initially the pain that the cutting and cauterization would cause and the long-term effects of the amputation. I would imagine that those that have lost several people would have difficulties in completed daily activates. I wonder if the permanent mutilation acts as a reminder of the loss and aids in the grieving process. </p>
<p> Even though I do not understand the practice, I think that the banning of it is wrong. A person’s culture and beliefs should not be challenged in this way. This practice held religious value and helped in the grieving process of this tribe and I would be interested in understanding why it was banned in New Guinea. I would also be interested in how the grieving process of the tribe has changed since it was banned. </p>
<p> It’s on a entirely diffeгent topic but it has pretty much the same laʏout and design. Great cһoіce of colors! </p>

<doc id="file14875115" filename="Groom's_cake" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom%27s_cake">
<p> A groom's cake is a wedding tradition originating in Victorian England,[1] but observed more often in the modern age in the American South. While a wedding cake may often be decorated in white and light in texture or color, the groom's cake can take a variety of forms, many incorporating chocolate or fruit.[2] Cheesecake sometimes serves as a groom's cake. The groom's cake is often served at a table separate from the wedding cake at a wedding reception or wedding breakfast, though it may be served as a dessert for a rehearsal dinner. </p>
<p> The tradition of the groom's cake began in Britain. The groom's cake was often richer than the bride's, since stronger flavors such as chocolate, fruitcake, and alcohol were considered more appropriate to "the stronger sex." Groom's cakes during the Victorian era were heavy, dense fruitcakes. A characteristic recipe for the groom's fruit cake was published in The British Baker in 1897.[3] Eventually, flour cakes, either white or chocolate, supplanted fruit cakes as the most popular choice. </p>
<p> Groom’s cake is a tradition most popular in the southeastern United States. It was brought over from Britain by colonists. The Southern groom's cake was traditionally a dark-liquor soaked fruitcake, especially in Virginia. The white-iced bride's cake was considered too light for masculinity.[4] Chocolate groom's cakes became popular in the late 19th century, and can be any flavor, such as carrot cake, red velvet cake, etc.[3] </p>
<p> Groom's cakes are usually served at the wedding reception as a second flavor choice to the guests, but are often served at the rehearsal dinner in some regions. Groom's Cakes are often decorated to reflect the groom's hobbies or interests, such as golfing, fishing, hunting, or sports. The 1989 movie Steel Magnolias features a famous scene with a red velvet groom's cake shaped as a giant armadillo. </p>
<p> Another tradition was to cut a piece of the cake and put it in a small box, then present the box to an unmarried woman attending the wedding.[5] The woman was not expected to eat the cake, but rather to put it under her pillow. Superstition held that this tradition would help an unmarried woman find a husband.[5] </p>

<p> "Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him." ~Romans 14:3~ </p>
<p> Have you ever wondered WHY you do some of the things that you do? Are we creatures of habit or does our environment play a big part in our lives? Does genetics decide what makes us who we are? </p>
<p> "For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether" ~Psalms 139:4~ </p>
<p> "For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well. " ~Psalms 139:13-14~ </p>
<p> Yes indeed, "We are fearfully and wonderfully made". Read or reread Psalms 139 to remind yourself of how much the Lord knows about you and yet He still loves you. </p>
<p> We are exactly what the Lord planned for us to be. He loves us not because of what we have done or will do but because of who He is. He loves us because of what His son Jesus did for us by dying on the cross. Jesus was the ultimate yet necessary perfect sacrifice. Remember that "without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin" (Hebrews 9:22). </p>
<p> His love for us is unconditional and undeserved! </p>
<p> OK, so let's get to the Ham Story........ </p>
<p> I don't know the source of this story but I really do love it. Hope you do too. </p>
<p> Once upon a time a mother and daughter who were working together in the kitchen preparing the Easter dinner. They always worked together to make their special traditional family Easter meal. No matter what the mother was doing, it seemed that the daughter was always watching her intently. The mother could even feel her daughters big brown eyes on her without even turning to see if she was in the room. Yet she continued with her task of preparing the meal without even missing a beat or a blink. </p>
<p> As she did every year the mother took the pan out of the cupboard and set it on the counter. Then she went to the fridge and removed the ham that had been defrosting. They had a large ham this year. It was not unusually large or different then last year's ham. </p>
<p> She took the wrapping off and then proceeded to cut about an inch off of either end of the ham. </p>
<p> Before the mother even put the ham in the pan the daughter stopped her and said: </p>
<p> "Mom why did you cut the ends off the ham?". </p>
<p> The mother stopped in her tracks and pondered the question. She was rather perplexed since no one had ever asked her why she cut the ham that way before. She had done it that way as long as she could remember. </p>
<p> The mother answered her daughter and said: "Well sweetie, I really don't know the answer to your question. Your Grandma always cut the ends off of her ham and I have just naturally done the same thing. I never ever wondered why I did that though. So let's call Grandma and ask her why she cuts the ham that way." </p>
<p> So they grabbed the phone and called Grandma. Then the mother asked her mother if she knew why she cut the ends of the ham off before placing it in the pan. </p>
<p> The Grandmother stopped and became rather quiet. She hadn't thought about her ritual of cutting the ham being anything different then normal. Then it occurred to her that her own mother had done the very same thing for as long as she remembered. The Grandmother suggested that the daughter call her mother and ask her that very question. </p>
<p> So she hung up the phone and dialed the little girl's great-grandmother. After the usual pleasantries she asked her why she cut the ends of the ham off before cooking it. She replied without hesitation and with a smile in her voice along with a little chuckle...... The reason that she cut the ends off of the ham was because back in the early days of their marriage she didn't have a pan big enough to hold the ham. They couldn't afford to buy a bigger pan either. So that was the only way to make the ham fit in the pan. Now we know why she has done that for as long as they can remember and so do you! </p>
<p> What does the Bible say about HAM? </p>
<p> "The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not cloven footed, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean." ~Leviticus 11:26~ </p>
<p> Do you know what the Bible says about Ham and Pork? Both Pork and Pig were not found in the Bible when I did a search. </p>
<p> Ham is mentioned in 16 verses but they all refer to the son of Abraham. To learn more about him visit Annie's Noah's Ark Page </p>
<p> Just to clarify things...... I am certainly not telling people to eat pork or to not eat pork. I am not the Holy Spirit. It is important to learn what the whole Bible says about this and then ask the Lord what you should do. As Christian's we are not to be bound by the "law" of the Old Testament but we are not to offend those that are weaker or younger in their faith either. Read the New Testament passages about this HERE. </p>
<p> "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:" ~Luke 6:37~ </p>
<p> "I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean." ~Romans 14:14~ </p>
<p> Actually Ham in the Old Testament was considered an UNCLEAN animal and the Jewish people were not to eat it. To find out more about the foods we that are considered "clean and unclean" visit Nave's Topical Bible page about Food. We are not bound by the laws of the Old Testament but it is interesting and can't hurt us to learn about why these foods were considered unclean. It is pretty amazing how the Old Testament Laws about food & sanitation were given so long ago, yet we are just learning now the significance of them. It is mentioned that they were told to throw away cracked pottery. Now we know that bacteria grows in them if they are cracked and can make you very ill. God's provision and care for us is immeasurable. Our God is truly an awesome God! </p>
<p> It is rather ironic that people actually eat HAM on Easter. Ham is an unclean and forbidden food for the Jewish people and Easter is based on Eshtar the pagan god. Oh well!!! To learn more about the history of Easter visit: Annie's Easter History Page </p>

<p> Hawaiian Roll Italian Sliders Recipe </p>
<p> These Hawaiian Roll Italian Sliders are a simple, one-pan recipe that anyone can make. Hawaiian rolls are filled with deli meats and provolone cheese, basted with butter and Italian herbs, then baked. They are perfect for a game day recipe, potluck appetizer, or any other time you need to feed a crowd. </p>
<p> Hawaiian rolls: great roll or the greatest roll? If you asked me, I’d say greatest! </p>
<p> One of my favorite things to do with them is to make sheet pan sliders. </p>
<p> I noticed that I couldn’t find any Hawaiian roll slider recipes that were modeled after an Italian sandwich (aka, the greatest sandwich of all time). </p>
<p> I took it upon myself to come up with my own recipe and I think it turned out pretty good. </p>
<p> I love how easy they are to make. If you can put together a sandwich, you can make these Italian sliders. </p>
<p> After assembling the sandwiches, I made a butter/Italian herbs mix to slather on top. Mmm good! </p>
<p> You can even assemble them ahead of time and show up to a football party ready to pop them in the oven. </p>
<p> When you’re done, there’s only one dish to clean! My favorite part! </p>
<p> These Italian sliders are for sure making my Super Bowl menu this year! </p>
<p> Hawaiian Roll Italian Sliders Recipe </p>
<p> These Hawaiian Roll Italian Sliders are a simple, one-pan recipe that anyone can make. Hawaiian rolls are filled with deli meats and provolone cheese, basted with butter and Italian herbs, then baked. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 350. </p>
<p> Place rolls on a baking sheet. Slice in half. Leave rolls intact, but remove the top half. </p>
<p> Evenly layer the ham, salami, pepperoni, capicola, and provolone. Top with roasted red peppers and pepperoncini. </p>
<p> In a small bowl, add the melted butter and Italian herbs. Whisk together. </p>
<p> Brush Italian herb and butter mixture over the tops of the Hawaiian rolls. </p>
<p> Bake sandwiches for 15-20 minutes, until cheese is melted. If rolls are getting too brown, cover the top with foil (I usually do this for the last 5-7 minutes). </p>
<p> Holy moly! This looks so yummy. Capicola is one of my favorite lunch meats. I will be making this real soon, even if I don’t watch any games 🙂 </p>
<p> This looks so delicious. I don’t eat pork, so I wonder how I could substitute it? Maybe roast beef. </p>
<p> I typically use Hawaiian Rolls for sliders, but I m wondering if they would be too sweet for this Italian Pesto Slider. </p>
<p> Love sliders and these look super comforting! Perfect for game day, weekend eats or a random Wednesday 😉 </p>
<p> Now that’s what I call a slider! I love all the additional flavors on it instead of just being meat and cheese! This will definitely be my go-to slider recipe! </p>
<p> I love Hawaiian rolls and with all this cheesy and delicious meat?! I’m so in!! Would it be mad if I made all of these just for an afternoon at home by myself?! </p>
<p> These looks so yummy! Love hawaiian rolls and the use of roasted red pepper and pepperoncini’s! Delish! </p>
<p> I have to make 200 of these. can i make ahead, freeze them in foil…then when ready just pop in the over? </p>

<p> Christmas Traditions You Can Cut, Keep, or Totally Rethink </p>
<p> 10 Minute Read </p>
<p> We look forward to certain Christmas traditions each year, like baking Granny’s gingerbread cookies, watching Elf with the kids, or wrapping Christmas presents late at night while sipping eggnog. But sometimes cramming in all the fun holiday traditions at once can get overwhelming. And pretty soon, they aren’t even fun anymore. </p>
<p> This year, ignore the pressure to people please, and, instead, go for the Christmas tradition ideas that don’t stress you out. The key to deciding what stays and what goes is figuring out if you want to do it, if it’s in the budget, and if you actually have time for it. </p>
<p> Here are 12 Christmas traditions to rethink this year. </p>
<p> 1. Annual Christmas Bash </p>
<p> You may love hosting Christmas parties. Cooking for 50? No problem! It’s those folk’s favorite holiday tradition! But if you’d rather not spend several weeks planning and prepping for your annual Christmas open house, then don’t. Forget the cheese ball, homemade hot cider and sugar cookies, and just get together with those pals at a local restaurant. Split the check and enjoy a simple, stress-free evening with your nearest and dearest. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: If you do love throwing parties but hate the cost, invite less people or ask someone to co-host and share the responsibility. It’s your party, so do what you want! </p>
<p> 2. Competitive Lights Display </p>
<p> Make the yuletide bright with Christmas lights until your heart is content. But just remember all those lights come with a hefty price tag at the end of the month when the electric bill hits. And guess what? Santa can still find your house even if it’s not decked out with gigantic, colorful bulbs from top to bottom. </p>
<p> And if you’re decorating your house, it should be because you actually enjoy that Christmas tradition, not because your over-the-top neighbors guilted you into a light display worthy of Rockefeller Center. Your time and money matter more than how many people drive by to ooh and aah at your light display. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: If you just must make your front yard look like a glittering gingerbread house, then at the absolute least, put your display on a timer. Your decor doesn’t need to light up the neighborhood until the sun comes up. Be strategic with how you decorate, and your electric bill will thank you. And if your family enjoys looking at lights, you could pack a thermos of hot chocolate and drive around town to admire the best of the lit up yards. This is free, and you won’t freeze to death. You’ll be the parent of the year! </p>
<p> 3. Elf on the Shelf </p>
<p> This is a hot-button issue that can divide people faster than the "When do you start listening to Christmas music?" debate. So we won’t get into the pros and cons of the Elf. We’ll just say this: If you’re a diehard Elf on the Shelf fanatic, you can find ways to keep that holiday tradition going without running yourself ragged. And if you’re truly over this freakin’ Elf on the Shelf business, just tell your kids it went back to the North Pole this year—for good. They’ll be fine. We promise. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: If you’re pro-Elf, make it easier on yourself. The good ole Elf doesn’t need to build a Lego amusement park in the middle of the night and he doesn’t have to leave a gourmet treat for the kiddos every morning either. Keep it simple and keep it fun. Be creative without stressing yourself out about it. </p>
<p> 4. The Shopping Frenzy </p>
<p> We like a deal as much as the next person, but if you’re shopping "for sport," take a time-out. We’ve got a great Christmas tradition idea for you: How about not waking up at 3 a.m. on Black Friday to battle thousands of equally sleep-deprived shopping warriors just to get the best "deal"? </p>
<p> Alternative idea: Times have changed. You can get those same too good to be true deals online. Shop from the comfort of your couch while eating leftover pie and watching White Christmas. Buying Christmas gifts should be fun! But just remember—don’t let the pressure to spend destroy your budget. </p>
<p> 5. Christmas Cards </p>
<p> Sending fancy holiday cards with professional photography is a sweet Christmas tradition, but those cards aren’t a must. It’s okay if you didn’t have time or money to schedule a photographer, buy matching red-and-white outfits, and order hundreds of glossy prints this year. Cards are a meaningful gesture, but don’t make them more difficult or expensive than they need to be. You can still enjoy this tradition by limiting your card list and having the kids help you craft some beautiful letters with stickers and glitter. How fun is that? And it’s personalized! </p>
<p> Alternative idea: You can also just use photos you took earlier in the year as your designated family Christmas photo. Print a simple 4x6 from your summer vacation and plop a "Merry Christmas" sticker on it. Done and done. Keep your eyes peeled for websites like Shutterfly who offer 10–15 free Christmas photo cards. (You just pay the shipping costs.) </p>
<p> 6. Price-Inflated Plane Tickets </p>
<p> Oh, there’s no place like home for the holidays, but why not visit your family in January or February when prices are cheaper? You could even start a new holiday tradition, like meeting your folks in a fun city that’s perhaps within driving distance of your two towns. Imagine a calm, post-holiday vacation that costs half the price with half the crowd! Now that’s a peaceful gift. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: If you’re looking forward to being with your parents and siblings on Christmas day but need to save some dough, grab your tickets but skip the bulky presents. You’ll limit the outrageous baggage fees and avoid the stress of making sure your stuff doesn’t get crushed to smithereens. Make it easy by giving gift cards, shopping when you arrive, or shipping online purchases straight to your family members’ front doorsteps. </p>
<p> 7. A Freshly Cut Tree </p>
<p> Christmas trees are a must in most households, but if you dread the drama of picking the perfect, overpriced gem from your local Boy Scouts, try something else. What we mean is, use the garage-sale special buried in the back of your attic. (You know it’s in there.) Or buy a tree at your local craft store with a coupon. What really matters is how you decorate it and who you decorate it with. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: If you really want to get a "real tree" there are a few budget-friendly options to look into. Check around your area for a local forest that welcomes those who want to chop down their own Christmas tree. Or, just wait until it gets closer to Christmas Day before you buy your tree. That price will keep dropping as we near the big day. </p>
<p> 8. Gift Wrapping Service </p>
<p> If it’s complimentary at the store, go for it. But do you really need to pay someone to wrap all your gifts? This isn’t the North Pole, after all. And watch out. Even if you DIY, the costs can still add up! </p>
<p> For some people, it’s fun to see how Pinterest-worthy they can wrap their gifts. But it can take some pretty pennies to buy all those handcrafted bows, spray-painted twigs, and fancied-up fabric that will only get trashed on Christmas morning. You’ll save a ton of money just buying a roll of wrapping paper and a bag of bows from the local dollar store. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: You can still be creative without spending gobs of money. Why not cover your presents in the Sunday comics or colored butcher paper instead? Then have your kids decorate the paper with stickers, stamps and crayon creations. Trim it with some ribbon or twine, and you’re done! But if you really want to try something unconventional this year, how about chip bag wrapping paper? We’re serious. All you have to do is turn an (empty) bag of chips inside out, wash it, and then use the shiny, silver foil to wrap your gifts! </p>
<p> 9. New Christmas Outfits </p>
<p> You’ve seen them on your Instagram feed. Remember the advertisement of the cute kids with matching Christmas pajamas circled around the fireplace? They looked so happy and well-behaved, didn’t they? And cozy. That’s it. You decided then and there your family needs matching Christmas jammies. And what about at church? You picture everybody walking into the candlelight Christmas Eve service in their brand-new Christmas threads. We get it. It’s easy to think you "need" new outfits every Christmas. You can’t possibly wear that dress or tie someone saw you wear two years ago. Or can you? Oh yes. Yes, you can. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: Pass along the Christmas hand-me-down outfits for the kids, pull an old faithful outfit from the closet and spruce it up with new accessories. You and your family can still celebrate Christmas without decking yourselves out in a new wardrobe. Outfits really add up quick! </p>
<p> 10. Overnight Shipping </p>
<p> Is waiting until the last minute your favorite Christmas tradition? There’s just something about that frenzy feeling in the air while franticly eating all the Christmas sugar cookies. Listen, you don’t need overnight shipping because you’re planning ahead this year. Right? Don’t wait until December 22 to order your Christmas presents. If you order a few weeks earlier, you might even be able to score free shipping and have your gifts arrive in plenty of time for Christmas. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: Look, if something falls off your radar and you don’t realize it until it’s almost too late, either take the loss or go to the store to pick something up. Does getting out with the crazed holiday shoppers stink? Yeah, it does. But it’s better than coughing up an extra $25. Plan ahead (like right now!) so you don’t have to worry about any of that stress. </p>
<p> 11. Holiday Party Extras </p>
<p> Ugly Christmas sweaters, Secret Santa and white elephant gifts—oh my! Sometimes it feels like people are just trying to get you to overspend in December. And if you do try to bow out of a planned festivity, you catch side eye from someone. But listen, you can get your jingle bell rock on while still being frugal. It’s possible and you don’t need a Christmas miracle to pull it off either. </p>
<p> Alternative idea: Participate if you want to, but be sure to set a budget for your spending and stick to it. That might mean you check out a thrift store to hunt for the tackiest Christmas sweater you can find. Or grab the most random item around the house for your office white elephant gift—like that "Mom Life" trucker hat collecting dust in your closet. </p>
<p> 12. Overblown Holiday Feasts </p>
<p> What is Christmas without all the fixings? It’s a Scrooge-filled holiday—that’s what. So we’re not saying you need to ditch having a family dinner or baking your favorite pie. But think about cutting back on the outrageous blowout feast in little ways here and there. After all, you don’t have to prepare the Who pudding, the Who hash and the roast beast. (Grinch references, anyone?) </p>
<p> Alternative idea: If you’re preparing the Christmas dinner this year, agree to fix the main course of turkey, ham, duck or whatever your tradition may be, and ask your guests to bring the side dishes. That way, you’re not stuck with the bill for that lavish feast and everyone feels the satisfaction of having helped with the prep work. </p>
<p> Rethink Your Christmas Traditions Without Becoming a Scrooge </p>
<p> We’re not trying to burst your Christmas tradition snow globe over here. Just remember: Christmas is all about spending time with others and blessing them—not spending money just because every Christmas commercial told you to. </p>
<p> If anyone asks why you’re not doing something as lavishly this year, just tell them you want to spend more time truly savoring the Christmas season and less time trying to keep up with the Joneses. Christmas isn’t a race or a competition, so slow down and enjoy it. </p>
<p> And no matter what, don’t get so caught up in the season that you bust your budget. If you’re looking for some budget-friendly buys, grab something from our online store or use our new, fancy gift finder to look for some incredibly awesome and meaningful gifts for the people in your life! </p>

<p> Homemade Italian Sausage </p>
<p> "One of my earliest and most vivid food memories was when my uncle Bill would make his famous dried Italian sausage every Christmas Eve. They'd be fried after Midnight Mass and served on bread with roasted red peppers. This fresh version was inspired by those. If you can manage not to eat them right away, letting them dry for a day or two really deepens the flavor, and firms up the texture as well, in true Uncle Billy fashion." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Cut pork shoulder into cubes. Place in a bowl and refrigerate while preparing the other ingredients. </p>
<p> Grind garlic with a pinch of salt in a mortar to make a paste. Add fennel, anise, and black pepper. Bruise spices lightly with a pestle to release the flavors. Add red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, oregano, marjoram, coriander, mustard, allspice, sugar, and a splash of water. Stir to combine. </p>
<p> Add the spice paste to the pork cubes. Mix thoroughly by hand. Add the remaining salt. Cover and refrigerate until flavors meld, 8 hours to overnight. </p>
<p> Process the cold pork through a meat grinder on the slowest speed. </p>
<p> Push a casing onto the stuffing tube of your meat grinder. Feed the sausage meat through the filling tray. Run the meat through the casing on the slowest speed until all the casing is used up. Tie casing at the end into a knot. Pinch and twist the meat to create links if desired. </p>
<p> Place sausage onto a wire rack set over a sheet pan. Refrigerate uncovered for 24 hours. </p>
<p> Preheat a charcoal grill for medium heat. Separate the links and grill them until browned, about 5 minutes per side. </p>
<p> Footnotes </p>
<p> Chef's Notes: </p>
<p> You can also grind meat in a food processor, and there are plenty of videos out there showing how, but then you'll have to get a sausage stuffer. </p>
<p> For a little nicer flavor, you can toast the fennel seeds in a dry pan just until you begin to smell them. This goes for any other whole spices you may want to grind and toss in. </p>

<p> Reviews </p>
<p> My review </p>
<p> Don't have the attachment to put it in casings, so I just made bulk sausage. Whole family loved it! </p>
<p> My husband is a hunter so I used this recipe to make venison sausage. I used half pork and half venison. We usually get our sausage made at a local butcher shop and it is expensive. I adjusted... </p>
<p> Awesome mix! This version did it skinless for breakfast tacos and later with diced potatoes onions and bell peppers for a nice dinner burrito! Next version will use hog liner for an actual sausa... </p>
<p> This is by far the best Italian sausage I have ever made. Another hit from Chef John. This is my fifth batch of Italian sausage glad to find this one. </p>
<p> The spices are on point for sure. I used half pork and half goose. Left out marjoram but everything else was delicious! </p>

<p> Follow us </p>
<p> How to Cook Lamb Chops </p>
<p> At the first hint of spring, we roll the grill out of the garage, crank up the flames, and toss some lamb chops onto the hot grates. Nothing does more for rich lamb than the smoky, charred flavors of the grill. We'll show you how to cook lamb chops on the grill -- and because there's more than one way to love lamb chop recipes, we'll explore how to cook lamb chops on the stovetop and in the oven, as well. </p>
<p> How to Grill Lamb Chops </p>
<p> Give your lamb chops a quick soak in a flavorful marinade. What ingredients are best for marinating lamb chops? Try balsamic vinegar, garlic, a little olive oil, and seasonings. (We have many more marinade options below.) How long should you marinate your lamb chops? Give them anywhere from 2 hours to overnight, marinated in the fridge. </p>
<p> As it gets close to grilling time, preheat the grill to medium-high heat. </p>
<p> Next, it's chops to the grill! Lay them out on the hot grill and sear for about 4 to 7 minutes; turn, and sear for another 4 to 7 minutes -- for medium rare, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 to 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). TIP: To keep the exposed bones of your chops from blackening, wrap them up with a little aluminum foil before putting the lamb chops on the grates. </p>
<p> When grilled to your preferred doneness, remove the chops and let rest for about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> When done, remove the chops and let rest for about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> See how Chef John grills lamb chops. "Using a blend of Mediterranean herbs and spices and a touch of cinnamon, these tender grilled lamb chops are served with orange and fresh mint sauce," says Chef John. </p>
<p> Here's an easy recipe for lamb chops on the grill. The quick marinade of white vinegar, salt, pepper, garlic, onion, and olive oil is great for steaks, too. </p>
<p> "Marinated lamb chops get grilled and then topped with a wonderful tangy pomengranate-port reduction," says WannaBeChef. "Most impressive!" </p>
<p> Chef John explains the origins of this grilled lamb chops recipe: "Usually, I take an Italian approach, and marinade the meat with lemon, garlic, and herbs; sometimes I'll go with more of an Indian style, and use a yogurt-based marinade along with the associated aromatic spices like cumin, cinnamon, and coriander. I love both styles. This recipe combines both styles into one uber-recipe." </p>
<p> "This recipe for grilled lamb chops is superb," says Sweet Pickles Mom. "The lamb is succulent and the sauce is such a flavor combination you will want to make this frequently. This is a recipe for people who don't even like lamb -- as it made a true convert out of me. It is a great sauce for beef and poultry as well, with a definite East Indian flavor. " </p>
<p> How to Broil Lamb Chops </p>
<p> Broiling is like the mirror image of grilling, with the heat source above the food instead of below it. It's the same idea as grilling, essentially. To cook your lamb chops under a broiler, adjust the top rack so it's about 6 inches from the heat source. Then crank the oven to broil. Cook your marinated lamb chops under the broiler, about 5 to 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). </p>
<p> "Lamb chops to impress," says emmy. "These chops are restaurant-quality with just enough earthiness to evoke that 'I slaved all day' without slaving at all." </p>
<p> How to Braise Lamb Chops </p>
<p> We're going to slow-braise these chops. Start by preheating the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Generously season lamb chops with salt and black pepper. </p>
<p> The key to a good braise is to build flavor by searing the lamb chops before adding the braising liquid. Heat a little vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or large, oven-ready skillet (with a tight-fitting lid) over high heat. When hot, sear your lamb chops until deep brown on all sides, about 4 or 5 minutes per side. Remove the lamb chops to a plate and cover with foil. </p>
<p> Saute some onions and garlic if you like. Cook the onions until slightly golden, just a few minutes, then add the garlic and cook for an additional minute. </p>
<p> Next, add your braising liquid, turn the heat to high, and reduce the liquid by about half, scraping up the luscious brown bits from the bottom and sides of the pan. What's the best liquid for braising lamb chops: stock, pomegranate juice, white wine, balsamic vinegar (combined with other liquids) all work well. </p>
<p> Return your lamb chops to the skillet or Dutch oven. Cover with that tight-fitting lid and slide into your pre-heated oven and cook until wonderfully fork tender -- give it about 2 hours. </p>
<p> Remove the chops and reduce the sauce on the stovetop if you like. Check for seasonings before serving. </p>
<p> Put a solid sear to these chops and then de-glaze the pan with pomegranate juice and a splash of balsamic vinegar. "This pomegranate braised lamb shoulder is about as seasonally appropriate as it gets, and one of the best things I've tasted in a long time," says Chef John. See how it's done: </p>
<p> These shoulder chops are slowly braised in beef broth and red wine seasoned with rosemary, garlic, onions, finished with a little Worcestershire sauce. "Lamb shoulder chops are one of the most inexpensive cuts of lamb, and slow-cooking them is the best way to get that nice lamb flavor," says kalphen. "The meat falls right off the bone with this recipe." </p>
<p> Here's a Basque-inspired braised lamb shoulder-chops recipe, featuring radishes braised with the lamb, sherry vinegar, anchovies, chicken broth, rosemary, and cinnamon. </p>
<p> How to Bake Lamb Chops in the Oven </p>
<p> Baking is another quick and easy way to cook lamb chops. You'll start with a simple marinade. Give the chops a couple hours in the fridge to marinate. Then place the chops in a preheated oven -- 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for about 35 minutes, turning once halfway through. </p>
<p> These lamb chops are quickly marinated and then breaded and baked in a hot oven. "I found a lot of great recipes out there for grilled lamb chops but only one for breaded, and it didn't have a lot of flavor," says MSAGGIEAMY. "So I came up with this easy recipe myself a few years ago. It's bursting with flavor and has become a comfort food staple in our home. Use plain or Italian bread crumbs. We like it with a Caesar salad and garlic mashed potatoes." </p>
<p> "These lamb chops were the simple answer to what my husband and I were looking for," says SHRUBBIE. "These were juicy, crisp, and very tasty right out of the oven! Amazingly quick and easy to prepare. I would like to try flavored bread crumbs next time." </p>
<p> You'll marinate these lamb chops in the fridge overnight. Bring the chops to room temperature before roasting in the oven. "These are the most delicious lamb chops you'll ever taste," says Nelson_Huynh. "Plan ahead so you can marinate the lamb overnight." </p>
<p> How to Pan Fry Lamb Chops in the Skillet </p>
<p> Here's how to cook lamb chops on the stovetop. Begin by marinating the lamb chops. Add your ingredients to a Ziploc bag and give the chops a nice massage to distribute the marinade evenly. Pop it in the fridge for about an hour. Remove the lamb from the fridge and salt well on both sides of the chops, drizzle with a little olive oil. Sear the chops on a hot grill pan over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes on each side. The grill pan will create a nice char. If you don't have a grill pan, no worries, a standard heavy-bottomed skillet will work great too. When done, remove the lamb chops to a plate and let rest for about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Note: Chef John uses chops from the shoulder of the lamb -- they're about half the price of chops from the loin. He quickly marinates his shoulder chops in pomegranate juice with fresh rosemary, freshly ground black pepper, and smashed garlic. And then adds them to the hot fry pan. </p>
<p> Impressive yet so simple to prepare, these herb-rubbed lamb chops are served with a delicious balsamic vinegar sauce starring shallots finished with a little butter. They get a quick fry in the skillet. "This recipe for lamb chops is a favorite in my house," says PGRAYMENDOZA. "It is an easy and quick recipe for two people (we eat two chops each). Rosemary and thyme give it great flavor. If you double the recipe, remember that the sauce will take longer to reduce." </p>
<p> This recipe highlights classic flavors. Lamb chops are simply seasoned with fresh rosemary and seared in a little olive oil and finished with a drizzle of homemade mint oil. </p>
<p> How to Cook Lamb Chops in the Slow Cooker </p>
<p> This will not surprise you, but cooking lamb chops in the slow cooker is extremely easy. You'll add the lamb chops, along with other ingredients, cover the Crockpot, set it to low, and then just walk away, folks. </p>
<p> With this simple recipe, you'll add onions and red wine to the slow cooker, along with lamb chops that you've coated with a honey, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, and herb mixture. "These are tender lamb chops slow cooked in a deep and rich red wine reduction gravy," says walliser. </p>

<p> How Enslaved Chefs Helped Shape American Cuisine </p>
<p> Black cooks created the feasts that gave the South its reputation for hospitality </p>
<p> “We need to forget about this so we can heal,” said an elderly white woman, as she left my lecture on the history of enslaved cooks and their influence on American cuisine. Something I said, or perhaps everything I said, upset her. </p>
<p> My presentation covered 300 years of American history that started with the forced enslavement of millions of Africans, and which still echoes in our culture today, from the myth of the “happy servant” (think Aunt Jemima on the syrup bottle) to the broader marketing of black servitude (as in TV commercials for Caribbean resorts, targeted at white American travelers). I delivered the talk to an audience of 30 at the Maier Museum of Art in Lynchburg, Virginia. While I had not anticipated the woman’s displeasure, trying to forget is not an uncommon response to the unsettling tale of the complicated roots of our history, and particularly some of our beloved foods. </p>
<p> It is the story of people like Chef Hercules, George Washington's chef; and Emmanuel Jones, who used his skills to transition out of enslavement into a successful career cooking in the food industry, evading the oppressive trappings of sharecropping.* It is also the story of countless unnamed cooks across the South, the details of their existences now lost. But from its most famous to its anonymous practitioners, the story of Southern cuisine is inseparable from the story of American racism. It’s double-edged—full of pain—but also of pride. Reckoning with it can be cumbersome, but it’s also necessary. The stories of enslaved cooks teach us that we can love our country and also be critical of it, and find some peace along the way. </p>
<p> It’s not easy uncovering the histories of enslaved cooks, who left few records of their own and whose stories often appear in the historical record as asides—incidental details sprinkled through the stories of the people who held them in bondage. In my recent study of enslaved cooks, I relied on archaeological evidence and material culture—the rooms where they once lived, the heavy cast iron pots they lugged around, the gardens they planted—and documents such as slaveholders’ letters, cookbooks, and plantation records to learn about their experiences. These remnants, scant though they are, make it clear that enslaved cooks were central players in the birth of our nation’s cultural heritage. </p>
<p> In the early 17th century, tobacco farming began to spread throughout Virginia’s Tidewater region. Before long, plantations were founded by colonists, such as Shirley Plantation, constructed circa 1613; Berkeley Hundred, and Flowerdew Hundred, whose 1,000 acres extended along the James River. These large homes marked a moment of transition, when English cultural norms took hold on the Virginia landscape. </p>
<p> Traditions surrounding dining and maintaining a grand household were part of those norms, and the white gentry began seeking domestic help. At first, the cooks they hired on plantations were indentured servants, workers who toiled without pay for a contractually agreed-upon period of time before eventually earning their freedom. But by the late 17th century, plantation homes throughout Virginia had turned to enslaved laborers, captured from central and western Africa, to grow crops, build structures and generally remain at the beck and call of white families. Before long these enslaved cooks took the roles that had once been occupied by white indentured servants. </p>
<p> Black cooks were bound to the fire, 24 hours a day. They lived in the kitchen, sleeping upstairs above the hearth during the winters, and outside come summertime. Up every day before dawn, they baked bread for the mornings, cooked soups for the afternoons, and created divine feasts for the evenings. They roasted meats, made jellies, cooked puddings, and crafted desserts, preparing several meals a day for the white family. They also had to feed every free person who passed through the plantation. If a traveler showed up, day or night, bells would ring for the enslaved cook to prepare food. For a guest, this must have been delightful: biscuits, ham, and some brandy, all made on site, ready to eat at 2:30 a.m. or whenever you pleased. For the cooks, it must have been a different kind of experience. </p>
<p> Enslaved cooks were always under the direct gaze of white Virginians. Private moments were rare, as was rest. But cooks wielded great power: As part of the “front stage” of plantation culture, they carried the reputations of their enslavers—and of Virginia—on their shoulders. Guests wrote gushing missives about the meals in they ate while visiting these homes. While the missus may have helped design the menu, or provided some recipes, it was the enslaved cooks who created the meals that made Virginia, and eventually the South, known for its culinary fare and hospitable nature. </p>
<p> These cooks knew their craft. Hercules, who cooked for George Washington, and James Hemings, an enslaved cook at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, were both formally trained, albeit in different styles. Hercules was taught by the well-known New York tavern keeper and culinary giant Samuel Frances, who mentored him in Philadelphia; Hemings traveled with Jefferson to Paris, where he learned French-style cooking. Hercules and Hemings were the nation’s first celebrity chefs, famous for their talents and skills. </p>
<p> Folklore, archaeological evidence, and a rich oral tradition reveal that other cooks, their names now lost, also weaved their talents into the fabric of our culinary heritage, creating and normalizing the mixture of European, African, and Native American cuisines that became the staples of Southern food. Enslaved cooks brought this cuisine its unique flavors, adding ingredients such as hot peppers, peanuts, okra, and greens. They created favorites like gumbo, an adaptation of a traditional West African stew; and jambalaya, a cousin of Jolof rice, a spicy, heavily seasoned rice dish with vegetables and meat. These dishes traveled with captured West Africans on slave ships, and into the kitchens of Virginia’s elite. </p>
<p> You also see evidence of this multi-cultural transformation in so-called “receipt books,” handwritten cookbooks from the 18th and 19th centuries. These were compiled by slaveholding women, whose responsibilities sat firmly in the domestic sphere, and are now housed in historical societies throughout the country. Early receipt books are dominated by European dishes: puddings, pies, and roasted meats. But by the 1800s, African dishes began appearing in these books. Offerings such as pepper pot, okra stew, gumbo, and jambalaya became staples on American dining tables. Southern food—enslaved cooks’ food—had been written into the American cultural profile. </p>
<p> For the women who wrote and preserved the receipt books, these recipes, the products of African foodways, were something worthy of remembering, re-creating, and establishing as Americana. So why can’t we, as Americans today, look at this history for what it was? Colonial and antebellum elite Southerners understood fully that enslaved people cooked their food. During the 19th century, there were moments of widespread fear that these cooks would poison them, and we know from court records and other documents that on at least a few occasions enslaved cooks did slip poisons like hemlock into their masters’ food. </p>
<p> But the country began recalibrating its memories of black cooking even before the Civil War, erasing the brutality and hardships of slavery from a story of Old Southern graciousness. The revisionism went full throttle during the era of Jim Crow, when new laws made segregation the norm. Post-emancipation America still relied heavily on the skills and labor of newly freed African Americans. In a highly racialized and segregated America, still grappling with its guilt over slavery, white people created a myth that these cooks were—and always had been—happy. Advertisers leaned on characters like Aunt Jemima and Rastus, stereotypical black domestics, drawn from minstrel song. </p>
<p> While newly free African Americans fled the plantations to find work as housekeepers, butlers, cooks, drivers, Pullman porters and waiters—the only jobs they could get—Aunt Jemima and Rastus smiled while serving white folks, enhancing the myth that black cooks had always been cheerful and satisfied, during slavery and with their current situation. You can find their faces throughout early 20th-century black Americana, and they are still on the grocery shelves today, though modified to reflect a more dignified image. </p>
<p> My angry audience member was likely raised on the old enslaved-cook narrative in which these images took root, where the cook was loyal, passive, and purportedly happy—a non-threatening being whose ultimate goal was to help a white woman fulfill her own domestic vision. But to be an American is to live in a place where contradictions are the very fibers that bind a complicated heritage divided sharply by race. It is to ignore the story of Chef Hercules, or the real story of Aunt Jemima. By forgetting enslaved cooks’ pain to soothe our own, we erase the pride and the achievements of countless brilliant cooks who nourished a nation. </p>
<p> *Editor's Note, August 15, 2018: A previous version of this article wrongly stated that Chef Hercules was our nation’s first White House chef, when, in fact, he served as George Washington's chef at Mount Vernon and at the President's House in Philadelphia, before construction of the White House was complete. </p>

<p> How to Cook a Thin Cut Boneless Chicken Breast </p>
<p> By Jann Seal </p>
<p> Laura Vryhof/Demand Media </p>
<p> The package of thin-sliced chicken breasts that has been sitting in your refrigerator for days needs to be either cooked or tossed. But coming up with a recipe that'll bring out the taste of the chicken without smothering it in a sauce mystifies you. And you know that just plopping the breasts into a skillet makes them turn into shoe leather. What's a person to do? First, don't fret! Thin cut chicken breast recipes are not only tasty, they're easy, creative and leave you satisfied. Hungry for a specific taste? Incorporate special seasonings into your recipe, and your chicken breast slices make a stellar meal. </p>
<p> Chicken – Meet Your Maker </p>
<p> Boneless and thin sliced chicken breasts need the help of good seasonings, slow cooking and a coating that'll give a nice crunch without overpowering the chicken. The delicate, thin slices don't stand much of a chance on their own. Low in fat, high in protein, when prepared correctly, they'll soon be a frequent visitor to your table. </p>
<p> Thin Chicken Breast Coatings </p>
<p> If you've ever seared thin-sliced chicken breasts on their own, you'll have discovered that unless you brown them to death, their color is so pale as to be unappetizing. That's where the coating comes in. Flour not only adds heft to your chicken, it helps during the browning process and gives it the crispy crunch your mouth enjoys. </p>
<p> Flour is the go-to coating for thin chicken breasts. You can use, not only all-purpose flour, but whole wheat, rice, gluten-free, corn and potato starch flours as well. And if you have a bag of almond flour in the pantry, it'll give your chicken a "South Seas" crunch. Each type of flour gives a different taste, but none overwhelms the chicken. </p>
<p> From Coating to the Pan </p>
<p> Once you've brought your chicken breasts to room temperature and towel-dried them, they're ready to be coated. In a large bowl, mix the flour and any seasonings you want to include. Garlic powder, salt, pepper, red chili flakes, chopped cilantro, and French or Italian seasonings add personality. Just don't use freshly chopped garlic – it'll burn during the sauteing process and give your chicken a bitter taste. </p>
<p> Gently place the pieces into the bowl, one by one, and cover them completely. Shake them out and place them on a kitchen towel or paper towel until all are ready for the skillet. </p>
<p> Sauteing the Chicken Breasts </p>
<p> Pour olive oil into a skillet and heat until the oil is wavy. One by one, add the chicken pieces and wait for them to sizzle. Each piece should take no longer than 5 minutes on each side to get the color you want and to be fully cooked. A meat thermometer reading 165 degrees Fahrenheit tells you when they're ready for dinner. </p>
<p> In less than 15 minutes, you've taken those wimpy pieces of chicken breast and turned them into golden nuggets. Spray a little lemon juice on top or serve with a dip of Thai chili sauce to ratchet up your meal. </p>
<p> Cooking in the Oven </p>
<p> Thin cut chicken breasts can also be prepared in the oven. Lightly oil a shallow roasting pan and heat the pan for 5 minutes at 350F. Lay the chicken pieces, either floured or just seasoned, into the oil, cover the pan, and let the chicken cook until it reaches 170F on your meat thermometer, or for about 25 minutes. </p>
<p> Turn on the Grill </p>
<p> Grilling also works when cooking thin sliced chicken breasts. Just keep them at least 6–8 inches from the heat source and oil the grill slats just before placing the meat over the fire. Turn the pieces several times and slather your favorite flavoring sauce as they cook. Remove when the internal temperature reaches 170F. This should take anywhere between 10–20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices. </p>

<p> How to Cook Bratwurst in a Pan </p>
<p> Learning how to cook bratwurst in a pan is simple and can produce brats just as tasty as grilled ones. </p>
<p> Some bratwurst devotees think it’s sacrilegious to even consider the question of how to cook bratwurst in a pan but access to a grill isn’t always possible. </p>
<p> We’d hate to see you miss out on tasty brats just because there’s no grill around. </p>
<p> And we’ll let you in on a little secret — most brat “experts” can’t tell the difference between a grilled brat and a pan-cooked brat in a blind taste test for most bratwurst recipes. </p>
<p> Grilling brats may be the preferred method for many but knowing how to cook bratwurst in the oven as well as how to cook bratwurst in a pan are great tools to have in your brat cooking arsenal. </p>
<p> A well-rounded brat chef can whip up some delicious brats in any environment they find themselves in — grill, stove, oven, or campfire! </p>
<p> Picking the Right Brat </p>
<p> Before we get into actual cooking instructions for how to cook bratwurst in a pan — which are dead simple — let’s start with your brats. </p>
<p> Kewauskum, Klement’s, and Usinger’s make some of the tastiest brats you’ll ever eat but they’re out to find outside of the Midwest. </p>
<p> You can also sometimes get great brats locally from butcher’s or groceries that have their own meat counter. </p>
<p> Don’t be shy to ask if they’ll make brats for you as some have the equipment necessary and will make bratwurst and other sausage for custom orders. </p>
<p> You can also take the ultimate plunge and learn how to make homemade brats. You’ll need a good grinder and sausage stuffer but you’ll have a never-ending supply of some of the freshest brats imaginable! </p>
<p> How to Cook Bratwurst in a Pan </p>
<p> There are a few different ways to pan-fry bratwurst but they’re based on a pretty simple concept: cook your brats on medium heat in a large pan until they’re browned to your liking. </p>
<p> You’ll need to add a little liquid to the pan to help them brown up and stay moist. Some people add their brats then pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil over them. </p>
<p> We like the beer method — huge shock there — which is just as easy. Put your bratwurst in the pan and then add enough beer so that the bottom half of the brats are covered. </p>
<p> You’re not aiming to boil them so adjust the heat if necessary to keep them at a low simmer. </p>
<p> Once the beer cooks off we like to add a drizzle of olive oil, which helps them crisp and brown up nicely. </p>
<p> Cooking time will depend on whether you’re using pre-cooked or fresh bratwurst but basically cook them about five minutes on a side and then flip them over. </p>
<p> Cook bratwurst in a pan until they’re done to your liking. If you’re worried about temperature, most brats should be cooked to an internal temperature of 160F to 170F. </p>
<p> When it’s time to eat your tasty brats, they’re best served on a hard roll with stone ground mustard — don’t commit the sacrilegious act of eating bratwurst on soft, flimsy hot dog buns with cheap French’s mustard. </p>

<p> How to Cook Italian Sausage </p>
<p> This post may contain affiliate links. Please read my disclosure policy. </p>
<p> For hearty flavor and pure comfort, nothing beats scrumptious Italian sausage. I’ll show you how to cook Italian sausage on the stovetop, in the oven or on the grill so it’s crispy brown and juicy every time. </p>
<p> Italian sausage fits into so many fabulous recipes, such as sausage and peppers, sausage and pasta, or sausage hoagies with mounds of caramelized onion. Minestrone soup with Italian sausage cut into rounds is practically a feast all on its own. And it’s all made possible by proper preparation of the sausage. </p>
<p> What is Italian Sausage? </p>
<p> Italian sausage is made from seasoned ground pork stuffed into casing shells to produce links about 6 inches long. Typically it’s made with fennel seed and red pepper flakes. That combination gives Italian sausage its distinctive flavor and character. </p>
<p> How to Cook Italian Sausage </p>
<p> Unlike smoked sausage, Italian sausage needs to be cooked to 160°F as it is a raw ground pork product. </p>
<p> Cooking sausage too high, too fast and unevenly can cause links to be too dark on the outside and still raw at the center or the skins to split and disintegrate. </p>
<p> Gradually bringing them up to heat, and turned for even browning will allow for perfect sausages. To avoid them curling you can skewer them lengthwise or place in a barbecue clamp. </p>
<p> Do You Need to Pierce the Skin? </p>
<p> No, please don’t! This is common tip appears on many recipes but it’s not ideal. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, this will cause all those lovely juices to escape as well, sort of defeating the whole purpose of encasing meat in an impermeable membrane to hold the juices in. </p>
<p> Note: Cooking times will vary based on thickness of the sausages. </p>
<p> Stovetop </p>
<p> Place links in a skillet in water. </p>
<p> Bring slowly to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 -12 minutes, covered </p>
<p> Uncover, allow water to evaporate and continue cooking, turning frequently until browned. </p>
<p> Oven </p>
<p> Place links on foil-lined baking sheet. </p>
<p> Place in cold oven and turn heat to 350°F </p>
<p> Cook for 25-35 minutes or until internal temperature registers 160°F. </p>
<p> Grill </p>
<p> Place on a 375°F grill and close the lid. </p>
<p> Turn every until uniformly browned about 15 to 20 minutes or until the pork reaches 160°F. </p>

<p> How to Cook Italian Sausage- Spicy, Sweet Goodness : CookyAunty </p>
<p> You have bought your sausages, prepared your side dishes, and set the table for the evening. Everyone is coming! But, at the last moment, you wonder how to cook Italian sausage? It’s supposed to be easy, isn’t it? Find all the tips and tricks for cooking Italian sausage here. My love— and my family’s love— for a good, hearty meal as well as my interest in European cooking mean that we taste flavors from other cultures as often as we can. Sure, we love Vietnamese, Indonesian, Peruvian, German— but we adore a good plate of solid Italian fare. </p>
<p> This is why I am something of an expert on Italian sausages! I have bought them, I have cooked them, I have made them. It’s been a wild ride! As fun the learning journey is, I thought I would simplify the process for you. Here is the complete summary of all my secrets and experiences buying, making, storing, and cooking Italian sausage. After reading this, you will be an expert yourself! </p>
<p> What is the Italian sausage? </p>
<p> My family loves a good Italian sausage with sauces, bread, and potatoes on a cold evening. What is it, you ask? Well, there are many different types of sausages in Italy, but what is commonly referred to as “Italian sausage” in the US is a distinct, particular variety. </p>
<p> The Italian sausage is a pork-based one that is combined, in the making, with a couple of spices: fennel and anise. There are two main varieties included in the typical US Italian sausage: hot, mild, and sweet. The mild version of the US contains only the regular spices— that is, anise and fennel—, while the hot version adds one little naughty ingredient: hot red pepper pieces! The sweet Italian sausage, instead, has another ingredient added to the fennel and anise to give it its characteristic taste: sweet basil. </p>
<p> When you are planning your purchases and meals, think of what your general preferences are in what regards spices. Do you and your family really love a hot, spicy dish? If you do get the hot variant, what are you going to serve as a side dish? It should be something mild and soothing to counteract the strength of the red pepper. </p>
<p> To accompany sweet Italian sausage, you should make something with a little bite, spice, or acidity to it— think hummus, baba ganoush, or some other Middle Eastern antipasto. </p>
<p> How to buy Italian sausage </p>
<p> Throwing some Italian sausage into the mix is a sure way to make your dish stand out. It’s such an amazing taste! But how do you make sure that, if you buy your sausage, you are getting the best of the lot when you go to purchase it? </p>
<p> Other than making the sausage yourself, the best option to get a great Italian is to buy it from a specialized vendor. That is, someone who is dedicated to producing quality Italian foods. This way, you know you are truly getting the real thing! </p>
<p> If you plan to buy it at a general meat sell point, ask around. Your friends and neighbours will certainly know who has the best quality to offer. When you get to the vendor’s, you have the right to ask when and how the sausage was made and exactly what ingredients it has. Also check the surroundings for cleanliness: you always need to make sure that your meat is sanitary. </p>
<p> If you are purchasing the Italian sausage at a grocery store, make sure to check the sell-by date. Make this the last thing you grab before you head home: you never want to let your sausage be at room temperature for too long. </p>
<p> What is the best way to cook Italian sausage? </p>
<p> Now that you have your tasty Italian sausage and it’s safe and sound, it is time to decide how to cook it. Before you use either method, you need to thaw your sausages (if you were keeping them in the freezer). Never let them thaw on the counter, as this makes nasty germs multiply. To the contrary: get them out of the freezer and into the fridge the night before using them in your cooking. They will be thawed and safe! </p>
<p> There are many different methods that are used to cook Italian sausage. Here are the ones that have proven to be the most efficient in my personal experience: cooking the Italian sausages on the stove top and cooking them in the oven. </p>
<p> Read on to find out what steps you have to follow for each of these methods. Afterwards, you will be able to make a responsible and informed choice. </p>
<p> How to cook Italian sausage on stove top </p>
<p> The stove top is a great, simple method for beginners who want to try cooking Italian sausage. You will only need: </p>
<p> The stove top </p>
<p> As many sausages as you plan on eating </p>
<p> A medium to large non-stick skillet that is at least 2 inches deep. Preferably, you will use one that has a fitting lid to cover it. </p>
<p> The process of cooking Italian sausage in a pan is quite visible and straightforward, so you will not have any problems (just do not forget the pan on the fire). Follow these easy steps: </p>
<p> After thawing the sausages, you can let them simmer in beer in the fridge for one hour. This will give them a very special taste! Just make sure that the beer covers the Italian sausages completely. </p>
<p> Choose a skillet or pan that is medium to large: you need to consider how many sausages you are preparing. You do not want them to stick to each other while they are getting cooked. </p>
<p> Pour water (about a quarter of an inch) into the pan or skillet and add one tablespoon or two of olive oil. </p>
<p> Place the skillet on the stove top and heat it up for two minutes over medium heat. </p>
<p> Put the sausage or sausages in the skillet, making sure that they have enough space to slide around. </p>
<p> Place the lid on the skillet and let the water come to a boil. </p>
<p> Bring the heat down a little. </p>

<p> Whether as hotdogs for tailgating or just in marinara sauce for pasta, Italian sausage is a favorite. But are you always left with dry, charred sausages? Well, maybe, you are just cooking it wrong the way! There are different ways to cook Italian sausage and sticking to these methods is the key to cooking the ultimate succulent sausage. </p>
<p> ‘Italian sausages’ are not actually from Italy. They are, in fact, what people in the US refer to the sausages which are made of ground pork with a distinctive taste of fennel or anise. This sausage is usually available in the market in two different flavors, hot or spicy and sweet. The difference between the two lies in the amount of red chili flakes used in them. They are different from the regular breakfast sausages as they are more spicy. </p>
<p> ‘Italian sausages’ are versatile and you can prepare them in numerous ways and it will still manage to taste amazing. They are mostly used as pizza topping or with pasta sauce. They are available in bulk and with casings or as link sausages. Also, you have an option between fresh ones and parboiled. It is recommended to use the fresh ones, rather than the parboiled, as they are more flavorsome and you can cook them to perfection. However, always remember that since the meat is raw, it is very important to cook it properly. </p>
<p> Frying </p>
<p> This is probably the most common way of cooking Italian sausage. It is quick and easy, and makes a great breakfast, with eggs and hash browns on the side. Since frying can make the sausages dry, wine or water is used in the frying process to retain their juices. It is also advisable to use a nonstick pan, as it prevents the sausage from sticking to the pan. </p>
<p> Put a nonstick pan on medium high heat and spray some oil on it. </p>
<p> Now, add the sausages to the hot pan and brown them on all sides. </p>
<p> Once the sausages are evenly browned, add some wine (till the sausages are half submerged) to the pan. You can use red or white wine, depending upon your preference. </p>
<p> Cover the pan and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the sausages for 10 to 15 minutes, turning them occasionally. </p>
<p> Finally, using a meat thermometer, check if the sausages are cooked through. The sausages are done when the internal temperature is 165° F. </p>
<p> These pan-fried sausages can be enjoyed on their own or you can just slice and add them to frittatas or have them with bell peppers. Here are some recipes you can try. </p>
<p> Pan-fried Ketchup Sausages </p>
<p> Cooking time: 10-15 minutes Servings: 2-3 Ingredients: </p>
<p> Brown sugar, ½ cup </p>
<p> Bourbon, ½ cup </p>
<p> Ketchup, ⅜ cup </p>
<p> Combine the sausages, brown sugar, ketchup, and bourbon in a large pan. </p>
<p> Simmer in medium-high heat for 5 to 10 minutes or until the sausages are cooked through. Check the temperature with a meat thermometer. </p>
<p> Grilling </p>
<p> Grilling is another way to cook Italian sausage. Although it sounds quite easy, there are certain things that can go wrong and leave you with a dried-out piece of meat. The key to a good grilled sausage is to maintain the temperature. Very high temperature can dry the sausage altogether. When properly grilled, the sausage has a crispy outside and is juicy inside. You can grill it in a gas grill or barbecue. You can also parboil the sausages or grill them directly. Whatever be the method, it is bound to taste yummy. </p>
<p> Direct Grilling </p>
<p> Heat the grill to medium-high and spray the rack with a nonstick spray or oil. </p>
<p> To keep the edible casings from splitting or bursting, poke some holes with a fork. This will, however, let some juices flow out. </p>
<p> Place the sausages on the greased rack. </p>
<p> Cook for 10 minutes on both sides. For a perfectly cooked sausage, the internal temperature should be 165° F. </p>
<p> Another way of grilling these sausages is by parboiling or poaching them before the actual grilling process. This method leaves you with juicy flavorsome sausages. Although, you can just use water for poaching, beer gives an added juiciness. In case you are wondering if your kids can have this too, don’t fret, as all the alcohol evaporates during the heating process. </p>
<p> Poaching Method </p>
<p> In a large pan, combine beer, water, onion, garlic, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Poke the sausages with a fork to keep it from splitting or bursting. </p>
<p> Add the sausages to the pan and put it in medium-high heat. </p>
<p> Once the liquid starts boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Turn off the heat and remove the sausages from the pan. </p>
<p> Preheat the grill to medium-high and place the sausages on the grilling rack. </p>
<p> Grill for 5 minutes till they are brown. </p>
<p> Remove from the grill and let the sausages rest for a few minutes before serving them. </p>
<p> Although, pricking the edible casing keeps it from bursting, it is not recommended. Cooking the sausages in low heat will keep the casing and the juices intact; however, it can be quite time-consuming. </p>
<p> In a large pan, put the onion slices on the bottom of the pan. Make sure the pan is large enough to accommodate all the sausages. </p>
<p> Place the sausages on top of the onions and add beer and water. </p>
<p> Put the pan over medium heat and let the liquid simmer. Remember, you don’t have to boil it. </p>
<p> After 5 minutes, the sausages should be half-cooked. </p>
<p> Remove the sausages from the pan and let it rest for 2 minutes. </p>
<p> Preheat the grill to medium-high and brush the rack with some oil. </p>
<p> Lightly brush the sausages with some oil and place them on the hot rack. </p>
<p> Grill till the sausages turn brown and its surface is crispy. This should take around 6 minutes on all sides. </p>
<p> Once the sausages are cooked through, remove from the grill and let them rest for 3 to 4 minutes. </p>
<p> Serve with mustard. </p>
<p> Baking </p>
<p> Baking is probably the easiest way to cook sausages as it is practically effortless. When baking, you do not have to constantly turn the sausages or worry about them getting burned. However, it is very important to make sure the sausages are cooked, and not pink in the center. Baking is also a great option to make the classic Italian dish of sausages with bell peppers. </p>
<p> Poke the sausages with a fork to prevent them from bursting. </p>
<p> Grease the bottom of the baking dish with some oil and lay the sausages in the dish without overlapping. </p>
<p> Cover the dish with a foil and place it in a preheated oven of 375° F. </p>
<p> Bake for 45 minutes and then remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes until the sausages are browned evenly. </p>
<p> In a roasting dish, combine the sausages, bell peppers, potatoes, onions, basil, salt, and pepper. </p>
<p> Preheat the oven at 375° F. </p>
<p> Place the dish in the oven and bake for 60 minutes or until the sausages and potatoes are cooked. </p>
<p> Stir occasionally. Remove from oven and have it with pasta or spaghetti. </p>
<p> Things to Keep in Mind </p>
<p> The sausage should not be left outside and must be stored in the refrigerator as soon as it is brought from the store, or after preparing it at home. </p>
<p> Use fresh sausages within 2 days of preparing or purchasing it. </p>
<p> In case you are not going to cook it immediately, keep it frozen in a freezer, in a vacuum seal bag. </p>
<p> Sausage should never be defrosted on the counter. It can either be defrosted slowly in the refrigerator or in the microwave using the defrost setting. However, make sure you cook sausages as soon as you have defrosted it. </p>
<p> Always use a meat thermometer to check whether the meat is done or not. Meat-borne bacteria can be harmful. </p>
<p> Cooking Italian sausage is not difficult. With the proper knowledge about the cooking methods, anyone can prepare a sumptuous meal. So, the next time you have a craving for this ‘not-so-Italian’ delight, try out all these simple processes for the ultimate sausage treat. </p>

<p> How to Cook Lamb Chops in the Oven </p>
<p> Baking lamb chops in the oven is the best way to seal in all the goodness and flavor! </p>
<p> There’s no tastier way to make this meat than cooking lamb chops in the oven. </p>
<p> When man first realized that sheep were not only good as a meat source but also good as a way to clothe themselves they began to breed and raise them domestically. </p>
<p> Lamb is the word used for sheep that are less than two years old. </p>
<p> Before the age of two a lamb has more tender meat than the older sheep known as mutton. </p>
<p> When butchering sheep, there is often a prescribed number of cuts obtained from each animal. </p>
<p> The lamb loin chops are one of the favorite cuts along with the rib chops when it comes to roast lamb chops. </p>
<p> What are Lamb Chops? </p>
<p> The most tender cuts are those from the backbone of the lamb, called a lamb chop. </p>
<p> A lamb chop is a rib bone with a chunk of meat attached on one side. </p>
<p> When lamb chops are served together in one piece, it is known as a rack of lamb. </p>
<p> These are not to be confused with loin chops, which are cut from the back part of the backbone. </p>
<p> How to Marinate Lamb Chops </p>
<p> Marinating lamb chops give them so much more flavor. </p>
<p> They are very tasty by themselves with just a little salt and pepper. </p>
<p> However, I like to make my own marinade to really enhance infuse the lamb chops. </p>
<p> Then add lamb chops and marinate for at least 30 minutes per side at room temperature. </p>
<p> You can also marinate in the fridge overnight. </p>
<p> Just allow chops to come back to room temperature before you bake the lamb chops. </p>
<p> Cooking Lamb Chops in the Oven </p>
<p> My favorite way to cook lamb chops is in the oven. </p>
<p> By cooking the lamb chops this way, it keeps the juices with the meat and makes it very tender. </p>
<p> My method starts by preheating the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200°C). </p>
<p> Whilst the oven is heating, warm a pan with some oil on a high heat. </p>
<p> Then sear the lamb chops just for a minute on each side to really lock in the aroma. </p>
<p> Once seared, place the lamb chops on a baking tray and pop in the heated oven for 30 minutes. </p>
<p> An alternate method for cooking lamb chops is using your broiler. </p>
<p> Place your lamb chops under the broiler for: </p>
<p> Medium-Rare: 7-11 minutes @ 145ºF (63ºC) </p>
<p> Medium: 15-20 minutes @ 160ºF (71ºC) </p>
<p> Make sure to turn your chops once during broiling for even cooking. </p>
<p> Where to Buy Lamb Chops </p>
<p> You can buy lamb chops at most grocery stores as well as from your local butcher. </p>
<p> I personally like to order my lamb online from FreshDirect. </p>
<p> It can be hit and miss sometimes in grocery stores and I’ve found FreshDirect to deliver every time. </p>
<p> What to Serve with Lamb Chops </p>
<p> So many things can be a great accompaniment to lamb chops, with some of my favorites being: </p>
<p> Wine Pairing with Lamb Chops </p>
<p> Normally I would recommend a wine with heavier tannins like a Cabernet Sauvignon pairs well with lamb chops, but there are other choices as well. </p>
<p> If tannins are not your thing then you can try a Pinot Noir which will be softer and still full of flavor. </p>
<p> My personal favorite type of wine with lamb chops is a nice Cote du Rhone which has the tannins I like along with a nice spiciness that stands up well to the lamb flavor. </p>
<p> I also like a Barolo as well with its very strong tannins which is characteristic of the Nebbiolo grape. </p>
<p> Just be sure it’s decanted first. </p>
<p> Some other wines are Merlot, Syrah, or if you feel like indulging – a Bordeaux. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Remove from fridge and mix chops in the marinade. </p>
<p> Cover and refrigerate for another 30 minutes. </p>
<p> Remove from fridge and bring chops to room temperature. </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 400ºF (200º). </p>
<p> Place the chops in a baking tray in a single layer and bake for 30 minutes, turning once. </p>

<p> How to Cook Pork Chops </p>
<p> Danilo Alfaro has published more than 800 recipes and tutorials focused on making complicated culinary techniques approachable to home cooks. </p>
<p> Pork chops are a common dinnertime entree as they are somewhat simple to make and can be paired with a variety of flavors and ingredients. However, one of the biggest problems that most people have with cooking pork chops is that they turn out dry, tough, and flavorless. Overcooking is one of the main reasons for this, but it can also be due to the cut of the chop as well as its fat content. The good news is that dry pork chops can be easily avoided by following a few simple guidelines. </p>
<p> Buying </p>
<p> A successful outcome of a final dish often begins with the ingredients themselves. So it is important to purchase a certain cut of pork chop to assure you will have delicious results. The best pork chops are center-cut loin chops or center-cut rib chops that are one inch thick. Whether you go with a loin chop or a rib chop, you'll have better results with bone-in pork chops; not only does the bone contribute flavor but it also helps the pork chop stay nice and juicy. </p>
<p> You also want to be sure the pork chops are thick enough. If you've been eating pork chops that are about 1/2-inch thick, it's going to be really difficult to prepare them so that they turn out moist and juicy. If the pork chops in the meat case all appear to be this thin, ask the butcher if he or she can cut you chops that are an inch thick each. </p>
<p> Cooking to the Right Temp </p>
<p> Due to food safety concerns, for many years the recommended way of preparing pork was to cook it well-done, leaving many of us overcooking our pork. But today it's perfectly safe to cook pork to medium, which means it's okay for it to have a slight rosy hue. </p>
<p> One issue we don’t have control of is that modern pork is much leaner than pork from years ago, and because it contains less fat, it's also less moist. This makes overcooking it even more likely. But by following a few steps from prep to post-cook, you can make delicious pork chops that everyone will love. </p>
<p> Preparation </p>
<p> There are a few steps you can take before you even start cooking to increase your chances of juicy pork chops. If you have stored them in the refrigerator, let the pork chops sit out for 20 minutes at room temperature before you start to cook. (You can preheat your oven to 400 F during this time). </p>
<p> Dry the pork chop thoroughly with paper towels, which will help them get a really nice brown sear on the outside. Then season generously with Kosher salt—it helps to press the salt crystals into the meat so that they really grab on—and freshly ground black pepper. </p>
<p> 1:04 </p>
<p> Watch Now: How to Make a Perfect Pork Chop </p>
<p> Use a Hot Pan </p>
<p> Once the pork chops have been sitting, dried, and seasoned, they are ready to be cooked. The first important step is that you make sure your pan is nice and hot. Heat an oven-proof skillet on the stovetop along with a couple of teaspoons of high-heat vegetable oil. You just need enough oil to fully coat the entire surface of the pan. Make sure you get it smoking hot; it might take 4 or 5 minutes to get hot enough, but it really makes a difference. Add the pork chops to the hot pan and let them sit there for a full 3 minutes, untouched. </p>
<p> Time in the Oven </p>
<p> The perfect pork chops are then finished cooking in the oven. After they are seared on one side, flip the chops over and immediately transfer the pan to the oven. Let the chops bake for 6 to 7 minutes. For the ideal doneness, you should be able to press your thumb in the center of the chop and feel it spring back firmly against your finger. If it feels mushy or jellylike, it's not done yet. Conversely, if it feels hard, you've overcooked it. The target temperature is about 140 F, but poking a hole in the chop with a thermometer will let the juices leak out so it is not recommended. </p>
<p> Let Them Rest </p>
<p> When the chops are done, remove the pan from the oven, transfer the chops to a plate, and tent with foil for 3 or 4 minutes. The chops will hit 145 F while they rest. Serve with a simple pan sauce. </p>

<p> How to Cook Sausage in a Pan </p>
<p> By Kathryn Hatter </p>
<p> DigiPub/Moment/GettyImages </p>
<p> Delightful at any time of the day, sausages fry up easily to provide a delicious meal. Although sausages may contain a variety of different ground meats, including pork, beef and turkey, they all contain a measurable amount of seasonings to make them zesty and tasty. Cook sausage in a pan -- the pan-frying method will produce tender sausages on the inside with a crisp and flavorful outer casing. </p>
<p> Place the frying pan on the stovetop and cover the bottom of the pan with about 1/4-inch of water. </p>
<p> Puncture each sausage two or three times with the tines of a fork and place the sausages into the pan. Piercing the sausage casings allows the sausage juices to flavor the cooking water. </p>
<p> Turn the burner to medium and cover the pan. Cook the sausages for about five minutes. </p>
<p> Remove the lid and rearrange the sausages gently with the spatula. Flip the sausages over to brown the other sides. Cover the pan again. </p>
<p> Cook the sausages until the water disappears and the casings lightly brown -- approximately 10 to 15 minutes. </p>
<p> Check the inside of a sausage for doneness. Remove one sausage and cut into it to see the center. As long as the center is no longer pink, the sausage is fully cooked. </p>
<p> Turn off the burner and keep the sausages warm in the covered frying pan until you are ready to serve them. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> According to the USDA Food Safety Inspection Service Sausage Fact Sheet, raw sausage must have a label that informs the consumer of the cooking process required before eating the sausage. Check the label of your sausage for specific cooking recommendations. </p>

<p> How to Cook Thick Cut Lamb Loin Chops </p>
<p> By Casey Fatzinger </p>
<p> Jupiterimages/Comstock/Getty Images </p>
<p> Lamb chops are similar in size to miniature T-bone steaks; they may look small, but they are packed with flavor. Cooking lamb chops is not a complicated process. These chops are served medium but can also be served rare or well done. They don't require trimming and can be cooked frozen, unlike other meats. The thicker the lamb chop, the more time it needs to cook. While the cost may be higher for lamb chops in comparison to other cuts of meat, they are worth every penny. You have a couple of ideal options when it comes to cooking the lamb: pan frying or grilling. </p>
<p> Pan Frying </p>
<p> Add water to a frying pan. Turn the stove onto medium; the pan is hot enough when the water begins to evaporate. Add 2 tbsp. olive oil to the pan and wait one minute for the oil to heat. </p>
<p> Season both sides of the lamb chops with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place into the frying pan. Let the meat sear for four to five minutes., six to seven minutes if the chops are frozen. </p>
<p> Flip the chops over, the opposite side should be brown. Sear the other side for another four to five minutes. Cooking the chops this long will make them medium. Add two minutes for well done or subtract one minute for rare and serve with your favorite sauce. </p>
<p> Grilling </p>
<p> Arrange the charcoal in grill to form a pyramid. Cover charcoal with lighter fluid, let soak for one minute. Light the charcoal. If using a gas grill, set to a high heat. Leave the grill closed for 10 to 15 minutes to heat the racks. </p>
<p> Spread the charcoal out evenly when it begins to grey. Season each side of the lamb chops with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the lamb chops on the grill. </p>
<p> Cook chops on one side for five minutes. Leave on for two minutes longer if frozen. Flip chops over, cook for an additional five minutes. Same deal as with pan frying: grilling for this long will cook it medium, add two minutes for a well done chop or subtract two for a rare chop. Remove from grill and serve. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> Lamb chops are meant to be served medium with the internal temperature being 150 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Saskatchewan Sheep Development Board. </p>
<p> An alternative to mint jelly is a yogurt sauce. Dice about five mint leaves and combine it with two parts yogurt and one part Dijon mustard. </p>

<p> How to Keep Pork Chops Moist When Pan Frying </p>
<p> By Jodi Buttarazzi </p>
<p> Rob Harris/Demand Media </p>
<p> Pork chops are a flavorful cut of meat that are tender and moist, if properly cooked. Pork chops can quickly become dry if cooked the wrong way, because there is no marbling of fat to keep it moist. The key to a moist and juicy pan-fried pork chop is to sear it. Searing locks in the flavor and natural juices. </p>
<p> Rob Harris/Demand Media </p>
<p> Remove the pork chops from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking. Pan-frying is best when the pork chops are close to room temperature. </p>
<p> Rob Harris/Demand Media </p>
<p> Blot moisture from each side of the pork chops with a clean paper towel. Searing is best done if there is no excess moisture on the chops. </p>
<p> Rob Harris/Demand Media </p>
<p> Add seasoning to the pork chops. Add flavor with a favorite seasoning, or sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. Press the seasonings into the pork chops to adhere. </p>
<p> Rob Harris/Demand Media </p>
<p> Heat a heavy duty frying pan on medium-high. Add a tablespoon of oil to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot, add the pork chops and sear on one side for approximately 6 minutes. Do not put too many pork chops in the pan at once. This will greatly reduce the temperature of the pan and proper searing will not occur. </p>
<p> Rob Harris/Demand Media </p>
<p> Flip the pork chops over and sear on the opposite side for an additional 6 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the pork chop reaches 155 degrees Fahrenheit. Remove them from the frying pan and let rest for 3 minutes. </p>

<p> Thin layers of sweet, spicy meat topped off with cheese make the Italian cold cut sub, or "hoagie," a sandwich connoisseur’s delight. Holding off on the mayo, mustard and pickles concentrates the flavors and distinguishes the sub from a straightforward ham and cheese sandwich. The purists may take the sub without any salad, but lettuce, tomato and peppers provide valuable moisture. </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Slice the bread in half and remove some of the inner filling to make more room for the meat. Drizzle the bread with olive oil and dried oregano. </p>
<p> Lay 4 slices of Genoa salami or spicy soppressata (keeping the rest for the other sandwich) along the length of the roll. Dense and oily, the salami gives the hoagie its distinctive Italian flavor. </p>
<p> Arrange a second layer using the mortadella and Parma ham, which tend to come in larger slices than the salami rosettes and will easily overlap. Top the ham layer with the cheese slices, and finish off with a layer of rich, spicy capocollo. </p>
<p> Fine shred the lettuce, slice the onion into thin slivers and cut the tomatoes and spicy pepperoncini into delicate rounds. Sprinkle the lettuce evenly over the meat, scatter the onion and lay the tomato and pepperoncini along the sub. </p>
<p> Drizzle the salad layer with a little more olive oil; a splash of red wine vinegar, for sharpness; and the salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Fold down the top layer of the first sandwich and repeat the process for the second sandwich. If taking the hoagie on the road, wrap it tight with a sheet of sandwich paper, deli-style. </p>

<p> How to make panna cotta </p>
<p> How to make panna cotta </p>
<p> Panna cotta is a traditional Italian dessert which literally translates as 'cooked cream'. Hailing from the region of Piedmont in Italy, it is a simple mixture of sweetened cream and gelatine. A good panna cotta is one that is only just set but can still stand unsupported once out of the mould. Panna cotta is very easy to make and can be made the day before a dinner party to save time. </p>
<p> Traditionally panna cotta was always made with just cream; however, as tastes change and people move away from heavy foods, chefs now tend to use a percentage of milk in their recipes to make panna cotta a lighter dessert which is also healthier. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Panna cotta </p>
<p> Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod and add both to a saucepan with the milk, cream and sugar </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Warm gently over a low heat, being careful not to let the milk boil </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Remove from the heat and stir through the gelatine leaves until dissolved </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Pass through a fine sieve into a jug and leave to cool to room temperature, stirring every few minutes </p>
<p> 5 </p>
<p> Once cool, stir one last time to evenly distribute the vanilla then divide between 4 moulds. Transfer to the fridge to set for at least 3 hours </p>
<p> 6 </p>
<p> To serve, run the moulds under warm water for a few seconds before carefully turning out the panna cottas onto a plate </p>
<p> Variations </p>
<p> As it is such a simple creation, panna cotta benefits from the addition of flavourings. Alan Murchison flavours his panna cotta with white chocolate, Josh Eggleton uses caramel for a intense richness and Greg Malouf creates a floral panna cotta with the addition of rose and buttermilk. Most herbs and sweet spices work well; you could try mint, lavender, elderflower or even honey. </p>
<p> Serving suggestions </p>
<p> Shaun Hill perfectly executes a Vanilla panna cotta and accompanies with fresh summer berries for a simple yet stunning dessert. Vineet Bhatia pairs his interesting Cardamom panna cotta with grilled peaches and rich white chocolate while panna cotta makes up part of Matthew Tomkinson's time consuming but spectacular Assiette of Apple dessert. </p>

<p> How to Make Perogies (A Delicious Ukrainian Tradition) </p>
<p> Perogy (or pierogi, pirohy, pyrhoy, etc) is a food from Central Europe that is especially popular in Russia and the Ukraine. Since we’re Canadian (and almost every Canadian will tell you that they have some sort of claim to being Ukrainian) we decided to tackle making perogies, as it is a dish that is near and dear to our hearts. ❤️ </p>
<p> If you’re unfamiliar with what they are, think Chinese dumplings. If you’re unfamiliar with those, think ravioli. All three of these foods are comprised of a filling wrapped in dough. Essentially, perogies are Ukrainian ravioli. Because of the similarities to ravioli and dumplings there are many myths surrounding their origins and who may or may not have brought them to Europe hundreds of years ago. But, instead of focusing on folklore, let’s focus on theses delicious potato based dumplings — #LiveInThePresent. (#realitysucks) </p>
<p> How to Make Perogy Dough </p>
<p> Perogy dough is as simple as you can get! Four ingredients are all you need to start your perogy adventure. 🥟 </p>
<p> 2 eggs </p>
<p> 1 tsp salt* </p>
<p> **We used water that the potatoes had been boiled in for extra starchiness. </p>
<p> Whisk the eggs, add salt and water, and then mix well with the flour. Knead the dough for 7-10 minutes or until the dough is soft, smooth, and bounces back when you poke it with your finger. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it sit for at least a half hour to give it a chance to relax. </p>
<p> Once the dough is finished its nap, unwrap it and begin to roll it out with a rolling pin on a floured surface so it doesn’t stick. We recommend working with the dough one quarter at a time — trying to roll out the whole thing all at once will become a major pain in the butt very rapidly. </p>
<p> 🍝 Mediocre Tip: If you have a pasta machine, use it! It’s the same principle as pasta dough. </p>
<p> When your dough is at an acceptable thickness (apparently ⅛ of an inch is a pretty standard thickness), use a cup, ring mould, or a round cookie cutter to cut out circles of dough. Now you’re ready to fill your perogies! </p>
<p> Delicious Perogy Fillings </p>
<p> Perogy filling is super easy to make — just mash some potatoes and add whatever you want to it. Classic combinations include: </p>
<p> Cheese and bacon </p>
<p> Bacon, sauerkraut, and onion </p>
<p> There are also dessert perogies, but we won’t get into that in this post. Dessert perogies are essentially just mini handheld pies, so you can put any pie filling in them! (Think blueberry or apple — apparently prune is really popular too.) </p>
<p> Anyways, back to savoury perogies — if it mixes well with mashed potatoes, you can put it in a perogy. Here’s how to make the filling: </p>
<p> Peel and cut potatoes into evenly sized pieces. </p>
<p> Put potatoes in a pot and fill with water, covering the potatoes. </p>
<p> Boil potatoes. Poke potatoes to test tenderness. </p>
<p> Once tender, drain the water. (If you haven’t made your dough yet, reserve a cup to use for your dough!) </p>
<p> Hope you have enough potatoes for the amount of dough you made. (It’s okay — you probably have too much.) </p>
<p> Mash your potatoes. </p>
<p> Add your flavourings. If adding cheese, add it while the mashed potatoes are still hot so it’s easy to incorporate and melts. Adding salt and pepper is also recommended here. </p>
<p> 🥔 Mediocre Tip: When making the filling, you can save some time by using a hand blender to mash the potatoes instead of mashing them with a potato masher. Your arms will thank you! </p>
<p> Angry Reader: “What, you’re not giving me measurements for my perogy filling?” </p>
<p> No! Perogy filling is a great time to experiment and make what suits your tastes. For example, a lot of perogy recipes we looked at called for a ratio of 3 cups mashed potatoes to 1 cup of cheddar cheese. We tried it, and it wasn’t cheesy enough, so we added 2 cups instead. If you have leftover filling, freeze it for next time or enjoy eating your fancy mashed potatoes on their own! </p>
<p> Shaping Your Perogies </p>
<p> Once you have your dough circles cut out and your filling ready, it’s perogy assembling time! Here are the Mediocre Chef approved steps to assembling a perogy: </p>
<p> Place approximately 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of the dough circle. (Add enough to fill the perogy without overstuffing.) </p>
<p> Dip your finger in a bowl of water and wipe the water around the rim of the dough circle. </p>
<p> Gently fold the dough circle in half, ensuring that the filling is spread throughout the perogy, but there is room for the edges to seal. </p>
<p> Gently pinch to seal the perogy shut. (You may need to rub more water on the seam to glue it shut.) </p>
<p> If you’ve never made perogies, ravioli, or dumplings before, then it may take a few attempts before you make the perfect perogy. Just work carefully and adjust the amount of filling so that it works for you! </p>
<p> How to Cook Perogies </p>
<p> The traditional method of cooking perogies is to boil them until they float, then tossing them in butter to coat. We prefer to boil ours, then fry them in some butter and oil to give them a nice golden brown color and to get them a bit crispy, but we respect the just boil and butter method as well. </p>
<p> 🥓 Mediocre Tip: If you cooked bacon to go along with your perogies, you can fry them in the leftover bacon fat for extra bacony goodness! </p>
<p> When boiling your perogies, don’t add too many to the pot — you don’t want them to crowd and stick together. Also be sure to give them a little stir to ensure they don’t stick to the bottom of your pot! </p>
<p> What to Eat With Perogies </p>
<p> Perogies can be served with a myriad of things — the most common way to eat them is with sautéed onions and sour cream. If sour cream isn’t your thing, that’s cool. Other ways to serve perogies include: </p>
<p> Bacon bits and green onion </p>
<p> Garlic and onions </p>
<p> Salsa and more cheese (think nacho perogies) </p>
<p> Perogies go great with pickled beets, sauerkraut, kielbasa, and cabbage rolls! </p>

<p> She's 90, she's adorable, and in this video she's teaching a Del Posto chef how to make an Italian masterpiece: timpano </p>
<p> Timpano. A huge, round "drum" of pasta, filled with even more pasta, meatballs, sausage, pork shank, and hard-boiled eggs. See: labor of love. This Italian dish, which is neither quick nor easy, has been featured in movies and on Sunday dinner tables alike, and now it's coming to New York City's Del Posto restaurant. </p>
<p> Like the best timpani, the one featured in Del Posto's video above comes courtesy of nonna. Chef di cucina Matt Abdoo spent hours with his 90-year-old grandmother, Valerie Mancuso, to learn how to execute her timpano so that he can (try to) serve the same thing at the restaurant. We see Abdoo sieving tomatoes and rolling meatballs as visions of Mancuso, likely wagging her finger, dance in his head. It's a testament to Italian food as a cuisine with deep roots and lots of soul, even at restaurants as polished and prestigious as Del Posto. Watch and prepare yourself to say "awwwwwwww." </p>
<p> Del Posto's timpano is now available upon request, and is $100 for four portions. </p>

<p> How to Pan Fry a Thin Cut Pork Chop </p>
<p> By Tom Ross </p>
<p> bluegame/iStock/GettyImages </p>
<p> A thin cut pork chop is approximately ¼ to ½-inch thick. The chop holds its shape, and some believe the flavor is better, when the bone is left in. A thin cut pork chop is very tender and tasty when properly fried. The diner is able to hold it by the bone and take neat bites from it without creating a messy situation. Fortunately, a thin cut pork chop requires little time to fry and is cooked as close to the time of consumption as possible. Plan on more than one thin cut chop for each adult for a typical dinner. </p>
<p> Set a large bowl filled with approximately 2-inches of whole milk on the left hand side of the work station. </p>
<p> Arrange a large casserole dish filled with approximately 2-inches of self-rising flour that is seasoned with salt and pepper to taste next to the milk on the right hand side of the work station. </p>
<p> Position a flat tray or platter next to the casserole dish of flour. </p>
<p> Place a wok or a deep heavy frying pan on the stove burner and fill it with 2 to 3-inches of oil that has a high smoke point, such as vegetable frying oil. The smoke point simply means that the oil withstands higher temperatures for frying without breaking down. Do not turn the stove burner on at this point. </p>
<p> Wear disposable plastic gloves if you have them. If not, wash your hands and dry them thoroughly. Place the thinly cut chops to the left of the bowl of flour and use the left hand to pick up the chop, put it in the flour and immediately cover it completely with flour. Press down with the left hand to embed the flour into the chop on both sides. The idea is to keep the left hand dry so a build-up of wet flour does not create a mess. </p>
<p> Shake the chop to remove loose flour and place it in the milk with the left hand. Use the right hand to immerse it in the milk giving it approximately 30 to 45 seconds to absorb the milk and then place it back into the flour. Use the left hand to completely cover it with flour while pressing the chop into the flour to insure it is completely covered. </p>
<p> Turn on the stove burner to medium-high and heat the oil. Use a cooking thermometer to heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<p> Use a pair of cooking tongs to carefully place the chops into the oil. A single layer of chops is enough to fry at one time. The chops will sink to the bottom of the pan and, when done, float to the top. When the chops rise to the top, remove one of them and use a stem thermometer to be sure it has an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The frying process will require approximately four to five minutes. Do not overcook the chops. </p>
<p> Allow the oil to recover its temperature back to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and repeat the frying process. </p>
<p> Tip </p>
<p> Take the chops out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before preparation for frying. </p>
<p> Several drops of egg shade food color added to the milk gives the thin cut pork chops a golden color after frying. </p>
<p> Warning </p>
<p> Frying in a pan holding several inches of oil could result in a splash. Have an ABC fire extinguisher and a first aid kit nearby. </p>
<p> Do not allow kids or pets in the kitchen. Cooking with boiling oil is dangerous if common caution is not exercised. </p>

<p> How to pan-fry cod </p>
<p> Pan-frying is a great option for cod fillet or loin as there is time to produce a lovely crispy skin without overcooking the delicate, flaky flesh. This is the way cod and similar white fish are often cooked in restaurant kitchens and is very simple to do at home. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Method </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> Lightly coat the base of a non-stick frying pan with olive oil then place the pan over a medium-high heat </p>
<p> 2 </p>
<p> Once the pan is hot, season the cod with salt and place it in the pan skin-side down (if the skin has been left on) </p>
<p> 3 </p>
<p> Cook for 2–3 minutes until the skin is nicely golden and crisp. If you are cooking skinless cod, cook until the fish has turned a nice golden colour </p>
<p> 4 </p>
<p> Carefully turn the cod over and cook for a further 2–3 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet or loin. The fish is cooked when the flesh becomes opaque </p>
<p> Tips </p>
<p> To ensure crispy skin, dry the fillets with kitchen roll before seasoning them with salt. </p>
<p> To ensure crispy skin on your pan fried cod, dry the fillets with kitchen roll before seasoning them with salt. Don't put too much oil into the frying pan and make sure it has a chance to get hot before adding the fillets. </p>
<p> If you are cooking a very thick loin or fillet, cook skin-side down in the pan until the skin is golden, then turn over and finish cooking in an oven preheated to 180°C/gas mark 4 for 6 minutes. </p>
<p> If desired, add a squeeze of lemon juice to the pan before serving to ‘brighten’ the final flavour of the cod. </p>
<p> Once you have turned the fish over, James Sommerin suggests adding a knob of butter to the pan and basting the fish for the final 2–3 minutes to add extra flavour and keep the fish moist. </p>

<p> How to Use A Chef's Knife </p>
<p> Danilo Alfaro has published more than 800 recipes and tutorials focused on making complicated culinary techniques approachable to home cooks. </p>
<p> Whether you are a novice cook or know your way around the kitchen, honing your knife skills is not only important for keeping you safe but will make your recipes that much better. Ingredients that are cut uniformly cook at the same rate and result in a dish that is cooked properly throughout. Since each piece of food is cut in the same fashion, the finished dish will have a nice presentation. </p>
<p> This tutorial will cover the correct way to hold a chef's knife as well as how to grip the food with your other hand to avoid cutting yourself. </p>

<p> Watch Now: The Correct Way to Use a Chef's Knife </p>
<p> 01 of 03 </p>
<p> Proper Chef's Knife Grip—Outer View </p>
<p> This photo shows the appropriate way to grip a blade. Note how the index finger is wrapped fully around the blade. The index finger and thumb should be opposite each other on either side of the blade while the remaining three fingers are sort of loosely curled around the handle. You should be gripping the knife mainly with the thumb and forefinger. If you find that you're tightly clutching the entire handle of the knife, just relax and loosen your hold. With practice, you'll get used to this grip, and soon any other grip will feel unnatural to you. </p>
<p> 02 of 03 </p>
<p> Secure the Food With the Guiding Hand </p>
<p> Now that ​your knife hand knows what to do, you need to make sure your other hand does as well. Your non-knife hand is called your "guiding hand," and its job is to hold the food to keep it from sliding around on the cutting board. This puts that hand in a uniquely dangerous position. With the knife blade quickly moving up and down, you need to keep those fingertips tucked safely away, while still being able to firmly hold the food. The grip shown here is called the "claw grip"—by keeping the fingers curled inward and gripping the food with the fingernails, the fingers stay out of harm's way. The side of the knife blade should rest against the first knuckle of the guiding hand, helping keep the blade perpendicular to the cutting board. </p>
<p> 03 of 03 </p>
<p> Alternate Claw Grip </p>
<p> In this modified version of the claw grip, the first knuckle of the guiding hand rests flat on the ingredient, with the fingers again curled inward safely. This time, the knife rests against the second knuckle rather than the first. Both of these claw grips is acceptable, so use whichever one you feel comfortable with. You may want to start off with chopping an onion to practice getting comfortable with how to use a chef's knife. </p>

<p> Massimo Bottura: The chef who reinvented classic Italian cuisine </p>
<p> Silvia Marchetti, for CNN • Updated 28th March 2018 </p>
<p> FacebookTwitterEmail </p>
<p> Up next </p>
<p> (CNN) — When rumors emerged late last year that chef Massimo Bottura was thinking about moving his Michelin three-starred Osteria Francescana restaurant from Modena, Italy, to London, the Italian city's mayor freaked out. </p>
<p> "The Osteria Francescana will stay where it is -- in Modena" he declared to local media, after calling the chef himself to find out if the rumor was true. </p>
<p> The mayor's panicked reaction wasn't a surprise to locals. Bottura is to Modena like the Colosseum is to Rome. </p>
<p> Osteria Francescana in 2015 </p>
<p> Courtesy Mattia (MO) </p>
<p> His Osteria Francescana, which opened in 1995, is a culinary icon in this city of 180,000 people in the heart of northern Italy's Emilia Romagna region, an area famed for its fast cars and balsamic vinegar. It ranks third on the current World's 50 Best Restaurants list and receives more than 120 booking requests each day from hungry diners fighting for one of its 35 seats. </p>
<p> All that hype prompts an obvious question: In a country already famed for its culinary excellence, what makes this 52-year-old chef so special? To put it simply, he's dared do what few chefs have been confident or skilled enough to pull off -- reinvent classic Italian cuisine. </p>
<p> Edible works of art </p>
<p> Bottura is fascinated by contemporary art and is an avid collector </p>
<p> Dubbed a visionary chef with a monkish allure, Bottura defines his food as "traditional, but seen from 10 miles away." </p>
<p> Like an alchemist, he elevates Italian food to art by pairing its essence with painting, music, philosophy and literature. The result is a mix of tradition and irreverence that touches all the senses -- an experience akin to admiring works by Jackson Pollock or Mario Schifano, the master of Italian pop art. </p>
<p> A sample dish, called "Five stages of Parmigiano Reggiano," transforms the King of Cheese by turning its hard surface and crumbling insides into a sublime foam. </p>
<p> "Compression of pasta and beans" turns a humble peasant dish into a multilayer masterpiece of cream, red chicory with bacon, bean cream, a Parmigiano crust cut thin like pasta and rosemary foam. </p>
<p> Then there are the dishes that'd likely shock your Italian grandmother, like "Eel swimming up the Po River" and "Snails under the vine." </p>
<p> Spirituality pervades Bottura's creations. </p>
<p> Dishes such as "Tribute to Thelonius Monk" are conceptual plates based on meditation, listening and tasting in the dark. </p>
<p> 'Since I was a kid, I was a troublemaker' </p>
<p> Osteria Francescana's "Hunting the Pigeon" dish features pigeon breast, beetroot juice, turnips, porcini mushrooms, apples and truffles. </p>
<p> Courtesy Paolo Terzi, Modena </p>
<p> Though Bottura has achieved global fame, being innovative in the land that gave the world pizza, lasagna and pesto isn't easy. </p>
<p> "For us Italian chefs, we grew up with such an important heritage, it's so important to focus on that," he tells CNN. </p>
<p> "So in another way in your mind you feel tradition is oppressive ... it's so difficult to be creative with such a heavy heritage." </p>
<p> Bottura says he looks at history in a critical way -- not a nostalgic one -- "to bring the best from the past into the future." </p>
<p> "Since I was a kid, I was a troublemaker -- I was escaping from my older brother under the table in the kitchen and from down there, where my grandmother was defending me, in the meantime she was rolling pasta," says Bottura. </p>
<p> "I was looking at the world from another point of view. It's what we do in Osteria Francescana every day. </p>
<p> "We look at the world from another point of view and we compress all our passion, the music, art, our past, our experiences, our memories, into edible bites." </p>
<p> No stopping this skinny Italian chef </p>
<p> "Oops! I dropped lemon tart!" -- both a dish and the name of a chapter in chef Massimo Bottura's book. </p>
<p> Courtesy Paolo Terzi, Modena </p>
<p> In spite of all he's achieved, Bottura isn't content to rest on past successes. </p>
<p> For Milan's Expo, which kicks off in May, Bottura will open the Ambrosian Refectory, an initiative to feed homeless people with the event's daily leftovers. Last year, he reflected on his 25-year career with a book called "Never Trust a Skinny Italian Chef," which features 50 recipes and stories highlighting his life, motivations and cooking techniques. </p>
<p> The chapter titles are as offbeat as the names of his dishes, including "Memory of a Mortadella Sandwich" and "Oops! I Dropped the Lemon Tart!" </p>
<p> He recently exported his passion to Istanbul with the opening of Ristorante Italia di Massimo Bottura, his first venture abroad. Franceschetta 58 is Bottura's new offshoot brasserie, which can be defined as a more humble take on Osteria Francescana. </p>
<p> Set outside Modena's medieval center, its goal is to introduce locals to foods from other Italian regions. </p>
<p> "I am a gastronomic traveler. I close my eyes and I want to understand where I am," says Bottura. </p>
<p> "Cooking is about emotion, it's about culture, it's about love, it's about memory." </p>

<doc id="file14874931" filename="Indian_cuisine" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cuisine">
<p> Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.[1] The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule, particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples.[2] </p>
<p> History </p>
<p> Indian cuisine reflects an 8,000-year history of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent, leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine.[7][8] </p>
<p> Antiquity </p>
<p> Early diet in India mainly consisted of legumes, vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy products, and honey.[citation needed] Staple foods eaten today include a variety of lentils (dal), whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), rice, and pearl millet (bājra), which has been cultivated in the Indian subcontinent since 6200 BCE.[8] Over time, segments of the population embraced vegetarianism during the Śramaṇa movement[9][10] while an equitable climate permitted a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains to be grown throughout the year. A food classification system that categorised any item as saatvic, raajsic, or taamsic developed in Yoga tradition.[11][12] The Bhagavad Gita proscribes certain dietary practices (chapter 17, verses 8–10).[13] Consumption of beef is taboo, due to cows being considered sacred in Hinduism.[14] Beef is generally not eaten by Hindus in India except for Kerala, parts of southern Tamil Nadu and the north east.[15] </p>
<p> Foods mentioned in ancient Indian scripture </p>
<p> While many ancient Indian recipes have been lost in history, one can look at ancient texts to see what was eaten in ancient and pre-historic India. </p>
<p> Middle Ages to the 16th centuries </p>
<p> During the Middle Ages, several Indian dynasties were predominant, including the Gupta dynasty. Travel to India during this time introduced new cooking methods and products to the region, including tea. India was later invaded by tribes from Central Asian cultures, which led to the emergence of Mughlai cuisine, a mix of Indian and Central Asian cuisine. Hallmarks include seasonings such as saffron.[23] In the late 18th/early 19th century, an autobiography of a Scottish Robert Lindsay mentions a Sylheti man called Saeed Ullah cooking a curry for Lindsay's family. This is possibly the oldest record of Indian cuisine in the United Kingdom.[24][25] </p>

<p> Many Indian dishes are cooked in vegetable oil, but peanut oil is popular in northern and western India, mustard oil in eastern India,[23] and coconut oil along the western coast, especially in Kerala and parts of southern Tamil Nadu.[28][self-published source?] Gingelly (sesame) oil is common in the south since it imparts a fragrant, nutty aroma.[29] In recent decades, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, and soybean oils have become popular across India.[30] Hydrogenated vegetable oil, known as Vanaspati ghee, is another popular cooking medium.[31] Butter-based ghee, or deshi ghee, is used frequently, though less than in the past.[citation needed] Many types of meat are used for Indian cooking, but chicken and mutton tend to be the most commonly consumed meats. Fish and beef consumption are prevalent in some parts of India, but they are not widely consumed except for coastal areas, as well as the north east.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Lentils are a staple ingredient in Indian cuisine. </p>
<p> Regional cuisines </p>
<p> Cuisine differs across India's diverse regions as a result of variation in local culture, geographical location (proximity to sea, desert, or mountains), and economics. It also varies seasonally, depending on which fruits and vegetables are ripe. </p>
<p> Andaman and Nicobar Islands </p>
<p> Seafood plays a major role in the cuisine of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.[36] Staples of the diet of the Indigenous Andamanese traditionally included roots, honey, fruits, meat, and fish, which were obtained by hunting and gathering. Some insects were also eaten as delicacies.[37] Immigration from mainland of India, however, has resulted in variations in the cuisine. </p>
<p> The cuisine of Andhra Pradesh belongs to the two Telugu-speaking regions of Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra and is part of Telugu cuisine. The food of Andhra Pradesh is known for its heavy use of spices, and the use of tamarind. Seafood is common in the coastal region of the state. Rice is the staple food (as is with all South Indian states) eaten with lentil preparations such as pappu (lentils) and pulusu (stew) and spicy vegetables or curries. In Andhra, leafy greens or vegetables such as bottle-gourd and eggplant are usually added to dal. Pickles are an essential part of the local cuisine; popular among those are mango-based pickles such as avakaya and maagaya, gongura (a pickle made from Kenaf leaves),[38] usirikaya (gooseberry or amla), nimmakaya (lime), and tomato pickle. Dahi (yogurt) is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness. Breakfast items include dosa, pesarattu (mung bean dosa), vada, and idli. </p>
<p> Arunachal Pradesh </p>
<p> The staple food of Arunachal Pradesh is rice, along with fish, meat, and leaf vegetables.[39] Many varieties of rice are used. Lettuce is the most common vegetable, usually prepared by boiling with ginger, coriander, and green chillies.[40] Boiled rice cakes wrapped in leaves are a popular snack. Thukpa is a kind of noodle soup common among the Monpa tribe of the region.[41] Native tribes of Arunachal are meat eaters and use fish, eggs, beef, chicken, pork, and mutton to make their dishes. Apong or rice beer made from fermented rice or millet is a popular beverage in Arunachal Pradesh and is consumed as a refreshing drink.[42] </p>
<p> Assam </p>
<p> Assamese cuisine is a mixture of different indigenous styles, with considerable regional variation and some external influences. Although it is known for its limited use of spices,[43] Assamese cuisine has strong flavours from its use of endemic herbs, fruits, and vegetables served fresh, dried, or fermented. Rice is the staple food item and a huge variety of endemic rice varieties, including several varieties of sticky rice are a part of the cuisine in Assam. Fish, generally freshwater varieties, are widely eaten. Other nonvegetarian items include chicken, duck, squab, snails, silkworms, insects, goat, pork, venison, turtle, monitor lizard, etc. The region's cuisine involves simple cooking processes, mostly barbecuing, steaming, or boiling. Bhuna, the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients, generally common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam. A traditional meal in Assam begins with a khar, a class of dishes named after the main ingredient and ends with a tenga, a sour dish. Homebrewed rice beer or rice wine is served before a meal. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils.[44] Paan, the practice of chewing betel nut, generally concludes a meal.[45] </p>
<p> Bengal </p>
<p> Due to being split between Bangladesh and India, the cuisine of Bengal differs in the use of religiously significant items, as well as international cuisine, such as Chinese food from the diaspora,[46] Portuguese items, and Anglo items from the colonial period. Bangladesh generally does not have the same amount of access to global trade and therefore, food.[47] Mughal cuisine is a universal influencer in the Bengali palate, and has introduced Persian and Islamic foods to the region, as well as a number of more elaborate methods of preparing food, like marination using ghee. Fish, rice, milk, and sugar all play crucial parts in Bengali cuisine.[48] </p>
<p> Bengali cuisine can be subdivided into four different types of dishes, charbya (চারব্য), or food that is chewed, such as rice or fish; choṣya, or food that is sucked, such as ambal and tak; lehya (লেহ্য), or foods that are meant to be licked, like chuttney; and peya (পেয়ে), which includes drinks, mainly milk.[49] </p>
<p> Bengali authentic full meal </p>
<p> During the 19th century, many Odia-speaking cooks were employed in Bengal[citation needed], which led to the transfer of several food items between the two regions. Bengali cuisine is the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the Indian subcontinent that is analogous in structure to the modern service à la russe style of French cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once[citation needed]. Bengali cuisine differs according to regional tastes, such as the emphasis on the use of chilli pepper in the Chittagong district of Bangladesh[50] However, across all its varieties, there is predominant use of mustard oil along with large amounts of spices. The cuisine is known for subtle flavours with an emphasis on fish, meat, vegetables, lentils, and rice.[51] Bread is not a common dish in Bengali cuisine, but a deep fried version called luchi is popular. Fresh sweetwater fish is one of its most distinctive features; Bengalis prepare fish in many ways, such as steaming, braising, or stewing in vegetables and sauces based on coconut milk or mustard. East Bengali food, which has a high presence in West Bengal and Bangladesh, is much spicier than the West Bengali cuisine, and tends to use high amounts of chilli, and is one of the spiciest cuisines in India and the World. Shondesh and Rasgulla are popular sweet dishes made of sweetened, finely ground fresh cheese. The "Jaggery Rasgullas" are even more famous. The rasgulla originated in Bengal.[52][53][54] and later became popular in erstwhile Odisha. The government of west Bengal has recently acquired the GI status of rasgulla after citing proof in court. </p>
<p> The cuisine is also found in the state of Tripura and the Barak Valley of Assam. </p>
<p> Bihar </p>
<p> Bihari cuisine may include litti chokha, a baked salted wheat-flour cake filled with sattu (baked chickpea flour) and some special spices, which is served with baigan bharta, made of roasted eggplant (brinjal) and tomatoes.[55][56] Among meat dishes, meat saalan is a popular dish made of mutton or goat curry with cubed potatoes in garam masala. Dalpuri is another popular dish in Bihar. It is salted wheat-flour bread, filled with boiled, crushed, and fried gram pulses. Malpua is a popular sweet dish of Bihar, prepared by a mixture of maida, milk, bananas, cashew nuts, peanuts, raisins, sugar, water, and green cardamom.

Being a coastal region, the communities are mainly dependent on seafood. Normally, rotli and tea are taken for breakfast, rotla and saak for lunch, and chokha along with saak and curry are taken for dinner. Some of the dishes prepared on festive occasions include puri, lapsee, potaya, dudh-plag, and dhakanu.[62] While alcohol is prohibited in the neighbouring state of Gujarat, drinking is common in Daman and Diu.

The Paranthewali Gali in Chandani Chowk is just one of the culinary landmarks for stuffed flatbread (paranthas). Delhi has people from different parts of India, thus the city has different types of food traditions; its cuisine is influenced by the various cultures. Punjabi cuisine is common, due to the dominance of Punjabi communities.[63] Delhi cuisine is actually an amalgam of different Indian cuisines modified in unique ways. This is apparent in the different types of street food available. Kababs, kachauri, chaat, Indian sweets, Indian ice cream (commonly called kulfi), and even western food items like sandwiches and patties, are prepared in a style unique to Delhi and are quite popular.[64] </p>
<p> Goa </p>

Kingfish (vison or visvan) is the most common delicacy, and others include pomfret, shark, tuna, and mackerel; these are often served with coconut milk.[65] Shellfish, including crabs, prawns, tiger prawns, lobster, squid, and mussels, are commonly eaten. The cuisine of Goa is influenced by its Hindu origins, 400 years of Portuguese colonialism, and modern techniques.[65][66] Bread, introduced by the Portuguese, is very popular, and is an important part of goan breakfast. Frequent tourism in the area gives Goan food an international aspect. Vegetarianism is equally popular.[67] </p>
<p> Gujarat </p>
<p> Vegetable Handva is a savory Gujarati dinner dish. </p>
<p> Gujarati cuisine is primarily vegetarian. The typical Gujarati thali consists of roti (rotlii in Gujarati), daal or kadhi, rice, sabzi/shaak, papad and chaas (buttermilk).

Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella), is widely used for flavouring vegetables and dals,[106] while garam masala and turmeric are commonly used for meat-based curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, and dahi (yogurt), that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer in rural areas.[107] Oriyas are very fond of sweets, so dessert follows most meals. </p>
<p> Popular Oriya dishes include anna, kanika, dalma, khata (tamato and oou), dali (different types of lentils, i.e. harada (red gram), muga (moong), kolatha (horsegram), etc.), (spinach and other green leaves) and alu-bharta (mashed potato) along with pakhala. </p>
<p> Puducherry </p>
<p> The union territory of Puducherry was a French colony for around 200 years, making French cuisine a strong influence on the area. Tamil cuisine is eaten by the territory's Tamil majority. The influence of the neighbouring areas, such as Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, is also visible on the territory's cuisine. Some favourite dishes include coconut curry, tandoori potato, soya dosa, podanlangkai, curried vegetables, stuffed cabbage, and baked beans.[108] </p>
<p> Punjab </p>
<p> The cuisine of Punjab is known for its diverse range of dishes.The cuisine is closely related to the cuisine of the neighbouring Punjab province of Pakistan. The state, being an agriculture center, is abundant with whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Home-cooked and restaurant Punjabi cuisine can vary significantly. Restaurant-style Punjabi cooking puts emphasis on creamy textured foods by using ghee, butter and cream while, home-cooked meals center around whole wheat, rice, and other ingredients flavored with various kinds of masalas.[109] Common dishes cooked at home are roti with daal and dahi (yogurt) with a side chutney and salad that includes raw onion, tomato, cucumber, etc. The meals are also abundant of local and seasonal vegetables usually sautéed with spices such as cumin, dried coriander, red chili powder, turmeric, black cloves, etc. Masala Chai is a favorite drink and is consumed in everyday life and at special occasions. Many regional differences exist in the Punjabi cuisine based on traditional variations in cooking similar dishes, food combinations, preference of spice combination, etc. Is it apparent that "the food is simple, robust, and closely linked to the land."[110] Certain dishes exclusive to Punjab, such as makki di roti and sarson da saag,[111] dal makhani, etc. are a favorite of many. The masala in a Punjabi dish traditionally consists of onion, garlic, ginger, cumin, garam masala, salt, turmeric, tomatoes sauteed in mustard oil. Tandoori food is a Punjabi specialty. Common meat dishes in this region are Bhakra curry (Goat) and fish dishes[112] Dairy products are commonly consumed and usually accompany main meals in the form of dahi, milk, and milk derived products such as lassi, paneer, etc. Punjab consists of a high number of people following the Sikh religion who traditionally follow a vegetarian diet (which includes plant derived foods, milk, and milk by-products. See diet in Sikhism) in accordance to their beliefs. </p>
<p> No description of Punjabi cuisine is complete without the myriad of famous desserts, such as kheer, gajar ka halwa, sooji (cream of wheat) halwa, rasmalai, gulab jamun and jalebi. Most desserts are ghee or dairy-based, use nuts such as almonds, walnuts, pistachios, cashews, and, raisins. </p>
<p> Many of the most popular elements of Anglo-Indian cuisine, such as tandoori foods, naan, pakoras and vegetable dishes with paneer, are derived from Punjabi styles.[113] Punjabi food is well liked in the world for its flavors, spices, and, versatile use of produce; and hence it is one of the most popular cuisine's from the sub continent. And last but not least is the Chhole Bhature and Chhole Kulche which are famous all over the north India. </p>
<p> Rajasthan </p>
<p> Cooking in Rajasthan, an arid region, has been strongly shaped by the availability of ingredients. Food is generally cooked in milk or ghee, making it quite rich. Gram flour is a mainstay of Marwari food mainly due to the scarcity of vegetables in the area.[114] </p>
<p> Historically, food that could last for several days and be eaten without heating was preferred. Major dishes of a Rajasthani meal may include daal-baati, tarfini, raabdi, Ghevar, bail-gatte, panchkoota, chaavadi, laapsi, kadhi and boondi. Typical snacks include bikaneri bhujia, mirchi bada, Pyaaj Kachori, and Dal Kachori. </p>
<p> Daal-baati is the most popular dish prepared in the state. It is usually supplemented with choorma, a mixture of finely ground baked rotis, sugar and ghee.[115] </p>
<p> Rajasthan is also influenced by the Rajput community who have liking for meat dishes. Their diet consisted of game meat and gave birth to dishes like laal maas, safed maas, khad khargosh and jungli maas.[116] </p>
<p> Sikkim </p>
<p> In Sikkim, various ethnic groups such as the Nepalese, Bhutias, and Lepchas have their own distinct cuisines. Nepalese cuisine is very popular in this area. Rice is the staple food of the area, and meat and dairy products are also widely consumed. For centuries, traditional fermented foods and beverages have constituted about 20 percent of the local diet. Depending on altitudinal variation, finger millet, wheat, buckwheat, barley, vegetables, potatoes, and soybeans are grown. Dhindo, Daal bhat, Gundruk, Momo, gya thuk, ningro, phagshapa, and sel roti are some of the local dishes. Alcoholic drinks are consumed by both men and women. Beef is eaten by the Bhutias.[117] </p>
<p> Sindh </p>
<p> Sindhi cuisine refers to the native cuisine of the Sindhi people from the Sindh region, now in Pakistan. While Sindh is not geographically a part of modern India, its culinary traditions persist,[118] due to the sizeable number of Hindu Sindhis who migrated to India following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, especially in Sindhi enclaves such as Ulhasnagar and Gandhidam. A typical meal in most Sindhi households consists of wheat-based flatbread (phulka) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one with gravy and one dry. Lotus stem (known as kamal kakri) is also used in Sindhi dishes. Cooking vegetables by deep frying is a common practice that is followed. Some common Sindhi dishes are Sindhi Kadhi, Sai Bhaji, Koki and Besan Bhaji. Some common ingredients used are mango powder, tamarind, kokum flowers, and dried pomegranate seeds.[119] </p>
<p> Tamil Nadu </p>
<p> Tamil Nadu is noted for its deep belief that serving food to others is a service to humanity, as is common in many regions of India. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes. Tamil food is characterised by its use of rice, legumes, and lentils, along with distinct aromas and flavours achieved by the blending of spices such as mustard, curry leaves, tamarind, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rose water. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being seated on the floor, having the food served on a plantain leaf, and using the right hand to eat. After the meal the plantain leaf is discarded but becomes food for free-ranging cattle and goats. A meal (called Saapadu) consists of rice with other typical Tamil dishes on a plantain leaf. A typical Tamilian would eat on a plantain leaf as it is believed to give a different flavour and taste to food. Also growing in popularity are stainless steel trays – plates with a selection of different dishes in small bowls. </p>
<p> Tamil food is characterized by tiffin, which is a light food taken for breakfast or dinner, and meals which are usually taken during lunch. The word "curry" is derived from the Tamil kari, meaning something similar to "sauce".[120][121] The southern regions such as Tirunelveli, Madurai, Paramakudi, Karaikudi, and Chettinad,Kongu Nadu are noted for their spicy non-vegetarian dishes.[122][123] Dosa, idli, pongal and Biryani are some of the popular dishes that are eaten with chutney and sambar. Fish and other seafoods are also very popular, because the state is located on the coast. Chicken and goat meat are the predominantly consumed meats in Tamil Nadu. </p>
<p> A typical Tamil vegetarian meal is heavily dependent on rice, vegetables and lentil preparations such as rasam and sambar, but there are variations. They have influenced Kerala as well in their Kootu, Arachi vitta sambhar and molagootals. As mentioned above, the Chettinad variety of food uses lots of strong spices, such as pepper, garlic, fennel seeds and onions. Tamil food tends to be spicy compared to other parts of India so there is a tradition of finishing the meal with dahi (yogurt) is considered a soothing end to the meal. </p>
<p> Notably, Tamil Brahmin cuisine, the food of the Iyers and Iyengar community, is characterized by slightly different meal times and meal structures compared to other communities within the state. Historically vegetarian, the cuisine is known for its milder flavor and avoidance of onion and garlic (although this practice appears to be disappearing with time). After a light morning meal of filter coffee and different varieties of porridges (oatmeal and janata kanji are immensely popular), the main meal of the day, lunch/brunch is usually at 11 am and typically follows a two-three course meal structure. Steamed rice is the main dish, and is always accompanied by a seasonally steamed/sauteed vegetable (poriyal), and two or three types of tamarind stews, the most popular being sambhar and rasam. The meal typically ends with thair sadham (rice with yogurt), usually served with pickled mangoes or lemons. Tiffin is the second meal of the day and features several breakfast favorites such as idli, rava idli, upma, dosa varieties, vada and is usually accompanied by chai. Dinner is the simplest meal of the day, typically involving leftovers from either lunch or tiffin. Fresh seasonal fruit consumed in the state include bananas, papaya, honeydew and canteloupe melons, jackfruit, mangos, apples, kasturi oranges, pomegranates, and nongu (hearts of palm). </p>
<p> Telangana </p>
<p> The cuisine of Telangana consists of the Telugu cuisine, of Telangana's Telugu people as well as Hyderabadi cuisine (also known as Nizami cuisine), of Telangana's Hyderabadi Muslim community.[124][125] Hyderabadi food is based heavily on non-vegetarian ingredients, while Telugu food is a mix of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian ingredients. Telugu food is rich in spices and chillies are abundantly used. The food also generally tends to be more on the tangy side with tamarind and lime juice both used liberally as souring agents. Rice is the staple food of Telugu people. Starch is consumed with a variety of curries and lentil soups or broths.[126][127] Vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are both popular. Hyderabadi cuisine includes popular delicacies such as Biryani, Haleem, Baghara baingan and Kheema, while Hyderabadi day to day dishes see some commonalities with Telanganite Telugu food, with its use of tamarind, rice, and lentils, along with meat.[126] Dahi (yogurt) is a common addition to meals, as a way of tempering spiciness.[128] </p>
<p> Tripura </p>
<p> The Tripuri people are the original inhabitants of the state of Tripura in northeast India. Today, they comprise the communities of Tipra, Reang, Jamatia, Noatia, and Uchoi, among others. The Tripuri are non-vegetarian,[129] although they have a minority of Vaishnavite vegetarians.[130] The major ingredients of Tripuri cuisine include vegetables, herbs, pork, chicken, mutton, fishes, turtle, shrimps, crabs, freshwater mussels, periwinkles, edible freshwater snails and frogs. </p>
<p> Mughlai cuisine is a style of cooking developed in the Indian subcontinent by the imperial kitchens of the Mughal Empire. It represents the cooking styles used in North India (especially Uttar Pradesh). The cuisine is strongly influenced by the Central Asian cuisine, the region where the Chagatai-Turkic Mughal rulers originally hailed from, and it has in turn strongly influenced the regional cuisines of Kashmir and the Punjab region.[136][134] The tastes of Mughlai cuisine vary from extremely mild to spicy, and is often associated with a distinctive aroma and the taste of ground and whole spices. A Mughlai course is an elaborate buffet of main course dishes with a variety of accompaniments.[137] </p>
<p> Uttarakhand </p>
<p> Saag, a popular Kumauni dish from Uttarakhand, is made from any of the various green vegetables like spinach and fenugreek. </p>
<p> The food from Uttrakhand is known to be healthy and wholesome to suit the high-energy necessities of the cold, mountainous region. It is a high protein diet that makes heavy use of pulses and vegetables. Traditionally it is cooked over wood or charcoal fire mostly in iron utensils. While also making use of condiments such as jeera, haldi and rai common in other Indian cuisines, Uttarakhand cuisine uses some exotic condiments like jambu, timmer, ghandhraini and bhangira. Similarly, although the people in Uttarakhand also prepare the dishes common in other parts of northern India, several preparations are unique to Uttarakhand tradition such as rus, chudkani, dubuk, chadanji, jholi, kapa, etc. Among dressed salads and sauces, kheere ka raita, nimbu mooli ka raita, daarim ki khatai and aam ka fajitha necessarily deserve a mention. The cuisine mainly consists of food from two different sub regions—Garhwal and Kumaon—though their basic ingredients are the same.[138] Both the Kumaoni and Garhwali styles make liberal use of ghee, lentils or pulses, vegetables and bhaat (rice). They also use Badi (sun-dried Urad Dal balls) and Mungodi (sun-dried Moong Dal balls) as substitutes for vegetables at times. During festivals and other celebrations, the people of Uttarakhand prepare special refreshments which include both salty preparations such as bada and sweet preparations such as pua and singal. Uttarakhand also has several sweets (mithai) such as singodi, bal-mithai, malai laddu, etc. native to its tradition. </p>
<p> Hindu fasting cuisine </p>
<p> Sabudana khichadi.A snack popular on Hindu fasting days </p>
<p> Diaspora and fusion cuisines </p>
<p> The interaction of various Indian diaspora communities with the native cultures of their domiciles have resulted in the creation of many fusion cuisines, which blend aspects of Indian and foreign cuisines. These cuisines tend to adapt Indian seasoning and cooking techniques to foreign dishes. </p>
<p> Indian Chinese cuisine </p>
<p> Indian Chinese cuisine, also known as Indo-Chinese cuisine originated in the 19th century among the Chinese community of Calcutta, during the immigration of Hakka Chinese from Canton (present-day Guangzhou) seeking to escape the First and Second Opium Wars and political instability in the region.[145] Upon exposure to local Indian cuisine, they incorporated many spices and cooking techniques into their own cuisine, thus creating a unique fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisine.[145] After 1947, many Cantonese immigrants fleeing political repression under Mao Zedong, opened their own restaurants in Calcutta, whose dishes combined aspects of Indian cuisine with Cantonese cuisine.[146] While Indian Chinese cuisine is heavily derived from traditional Chinese cuisine, it bears little resemblance to its Chinese counterpart.[146] The dishes tend to be flavoured with cumin, coriander seeds, and turmeric, which with a few regional exceptions, are not traditionally associated with Chinese cuisine.[147] Chilli, ginger, garlic and dahi (yogurt) are also frequently used in dishes.[147] </p>
<p> Popular dishes include Chicken Manchurian, Chicken lollipop, Chilli chicken, Hakka noodles, Hunan chicken, Chow mein, and Szechwan fried rice. Soups such as Manchow soup and Sweet corn soup are very popular, whereas desserts include ice cream on honey-fried noodles and date pancakes. Chow mein is now known as one of the most favorite Chinese dishes in India. Especially in West Bengal, it is one of the most loved street foods. </p>
<p> Malaysian Indian cuisine </p>
<p> Indian Singaporean cuisine </p>
<p> Indian Singaporean cuisine refers to foods and beverages produced and consumed in Singapore that are derived, wholly or in part, from South Asian culinary traditions. The great variety of Singaporean food includes Indian food, which tends to be Tamil cuisine, especially local Tamil Muslim cuisine, although North Indian food[148] has become more visible recently. Indian dishes have become modified to different degrees, after years of contact with other Singaporean cultures, and in response to locally available ingredients, as well as changing local tastes. </p>
<p> Indian Indonesian cuisine </p>
<p> Indian-Indonesian cuisine refers to food and beverages in Indonesian cuisine that are have influenced of Indian cuisine—especially from Tamil, Punjabi, and Gujarati cuisine. These dishes are well integrated. </p>
<p> Desserts </p>
<p> Many Indian desserts, or mithai, are fried foods made with sugar, milk or condensed milk. Ingredients and preferred types of dessert vary by region. In the eastern part of India, for example, most are based on milk products. Many are flavoured with almonds and pistachios, spiced with cardamon, nutmeg, cloves and black pepper, and decorated with nuts, or with gold or silver leaf. Popular Indian desserts include Rasogolla, gulab jamun, jalebi, laddu, peda etc.[153] </p>
<p> Non-alcoholic beverages </p>
<p> Tea is a staple beverage throughout India, since the country is one of the largest producers of tea in the world. The most popular varieties of tea grown in India include Assam tea, Darjeeling tea and Nilgiri tea. It is prepared by boiling the tea leaves in a mix of water, milk, and spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. In India, tea is often enjoyed with snacks like biscuits and pakoda.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Lassi is a traditional dahi (yogurt)-based drink in India.[155] It is made by blending yogurt with water or milk and spices. Salted lassi is more common in villages of Punjab and in Porbandar, Gujarat.[citation needed] Traditional lassi is sometimes flavoured with ground roasted cumin. Lassi can also be flavoured with ingredients such as sugar, rose water, mango, lemon, strawberry, and saffron.[156] </p>
<p> Sharbat is a sweet cold beverage prepared from fruits or flower petals.[157] It can be served in concentrate form and eaten with a spoon, or diluted with water to create a drink. Popular sharbats are made from plants such as rose, sandalwood, bel, gurhal (hibiscus), lemon, orange, pineapple, sarasaparilla and kokum, falsa (Grewia asiatica). In Ayurveda, sharbats are believed to hold medicinal value.[158] </p>
<p> Modern carbonated cold drinks unique to southern India include beverages, such as "Panner Soda" or "Gholi Soda", which is a mixture of carbonated water, rose water, rose milk, and sugar. "Narenga Soda", a mixture of carbonated water, salt and lemon juice and "Soda Nannari Sharbat", a mixture of sarasaparilla Sharbat with carbonated water are most popular non alcoholic beverages in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Street shops in Central Kerala and Madurai region of Tamil Nadu are most popular for these drinks which are also called 'Kulukki Sharbats' in Kerala </p>
<p> Alcoholic beverages </p>
<p> Beer </p>
<p> Most beers in India are either lagers (4.8 percent alcohol) or strong lagers (8.9 percent). The Indian beer industry has witnessed steady growth of 10–17 percent per year over the last ten years. Production exceeded 170 million cases during the 2008–2009 financial year.[159] With the average age of the population decreasing and income levels on the rise, the popularity of beer in the country continues to increase. </p>
<p> Others </p>
<p> Other popular alcoholic drinks in India include fenny, a Goan liquor made from either coconut or the juice of the cashew apple. The state of Goa has registered for a geographical indicator to allow its fenny distilleries to claim exclusive rights to production of liquor under the name "fenny."[160] </p>
<p> Hadia is a rice beer, created by mixing herbs with boiled rice and leaving the mixture to ferment for around a week. It is served cold and is less alcoholic than other Indian liquors. Chuak is a similar drink from Tripura. Palm wine, locally known as Neera, is a sap extracted from inflorescences of various species of toddy palms.[161] Chhaang is consumed by the people of Sikkim and the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region of West Bengal. It is drunk cold or at room temperature in summer, and often hot during cold weather. Chhaang is similar to traditional beer, brewed from barley, millet, or rice.[162] Kallu(Chetthu Kallu) is a popular natural alcohol extracted from coconut and pine trees in Kerala. It is sold in local Kallu shops and is consumed with fried fish and chicken. Its alcoholic content is increased by addition of alcoholic additives. </p>
<p> Eating habits </p>
<p> Indians consider a healthy breakfast important. They generally prefer to drink tea or coffee with breakfast, though food preferences vary regionally. North Indian people prefer roti, parathas, and a vegetable dish accompanied by achar (a pickle) and some curd.[163] Various types of packaged pickles are available in the market. One of the oldest pickle-making companies in India is Harnarains, which had started in the 1860s in Old Delhi. People of Gujarat prefer dhokla and milk, while south Indians prefer idli and dosa, generally accompanied by sambhar or sagu and various chutneys.[164] </p>
<p> Traditional lunch in India usually consists of a main dish of rice in the south and the east, and whole wheat rotis in the north. It typically includes two or three kinds of vegetables, and sometimes items such as kulcha, naan, or parathas. Paan (stuffed, spiced and folded betel leaves) which aids digestion is often eaten after lunch and dinner in many parts of India.[32] Apart from that, many households, specially those in north and central India, prefer having sweets after the dinner (similar like the western concept of dessert after meals). </p>
<p> Indian families often gather for "evening snack time", similar to tea time to talk and have tea and snacks. Dinner is considered the main meal of the day.[165] </p>
<p> Dietary restrictions </p>
<p> In India people often follow dietary restrictions based on their religion or faith: </p>
<p> Hindu communities consider beef taboo since it is believed that Hindu scriptures condemn cow slaughter. Cow slaughter has been banned in many states of India.[166] </p>
<p> Vaishnavism followers generally are strict lacto-vegetarians due to an emphasis on Ahimsa. They also do not consume garlic and onions because they are advised against it in the Bhagavad Gita.[167] </p>
<p> Jains follow a strict form of lacto-vegetarianism, known as Jain vegetarianism, which in addition to being completely lacto-vegetarian, also excludes all root vegetables such as carrots and potatoes because when the root is pulled up, organisms that live around the root also die.[168] </p>
<p> Unlike some East Asian countries, dogs and cats are not considered suitable for consumption. </p>
<p> Etiquette </p>
<p> Traditionally, meals in India were eaten while seated either on the floor or on very low stools or mattress. Food is most often eaten with the hands rather than cutlery. Often roti is used to scoop curry without allowing it to touch the hand. In the wheat-producing north, a piece of roti is gripped with the thumb and middle finger and ripped off while holding the roti down with the index finger. A somewhat different method is used in the south for the dosai, the adai, and the uththappam, where the middle finger is pressed down to hold the crepe down and the forefinger and thumb used to grip and separate a small part. Traditional serving styles vary regionally throughout India. </p>
<p> Contact with other cultures has affected Indian dining etiquette. For example, the Anglo-Indian middle class commonly uses spoons and forks, as is traditional in Western culture.[169] </p>
<p> In South India, cleaned banana leaves, which can be disposed of after meals, are used for serving food. When hot food is served on banana leaves, the leaves add distinctive aromas and taste to the food.[170] Leaf plates are less common today, except on special occasions. </p>
<p> Outside India </p>
<p> Indian migration has spread the culinary traditions of the subcontinent throughout the world. These cuisines have been adapted to local tastes, and have also affected local cuisines. Curry's international appeal has been compared to that of pizza.[171] Indian tandoor dishes such as chicken tikka enjoy widespread popularity.[172] </p>
<p> Australasia </p>
<p> A Roy Morgan Research survey taken between 2013 and 2018 found that Indian cuisine was the top-rated international food among 51% of Australians, behind Chinese, Italian, and Thai.[173] </p>
<p> China </p>
<p> Indian food is gaining popularity in China, where there are many Indian restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Hong Kong alone has more than 50 Indian restaurants, some of which date back to the 1980s. Most of the Indian restaurants in Hong Kong are in Tsim Sha Tsui.[176] </p>
<p> Middle East </p>
<p> The Indian culinary scene in the Middle East has been influenced greatly by the large Indian diaspora in these countries. Centuries of trade relations and cultural exchange resulted in a significant influence on each region's cuisines. The use of the tandoor, which originated in northwestern India,[177] is an example. The large influx of Indian expatriates into the Middle Eastern countries during the 1970s and 1980s led to the booming of Indian restaurants to cater to this population and was also widely influenced by the local and international cuisines. </p>
<p> Nepal </p>
<p> Indian cuisine is available in the streets of Nepalese cities, including Kathmandu and Janakpur. </p>
<p> Southeast Asia </p>
<p> Indian cuisine is very popular in Southeast Asia, due to the strong Hindu and Buddhist cultural influence in the region. Indian cuisine has had considerable influence on Malaysian cooking styles[5] and also enjoys popularity in Singapore.[178][179] There are numerous North and South Indian restaurants in Singapore, mostly in Little India. Singapore is also known for fusion cuisine combining traditional Singaporean cuisine with Indian influences. Fish head curry, for example, is a local creation. Indian influence on Malay cuisine dates to the 19th century.[180] Other cuisines which borrow inspiration from Indian cooking styles include Cambodian, Lao, Filipino, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, and Burmese cuisines. The spread of vegetarianism in other parts of Asia is often credited to Hindu and Buddhist practices.[181] </p>
<p> United Kingdom </p>
<p> Chicken tikka masala, a modified version of Indian chicken tikka, has been called "a true British national dish."[182] </p>
<p> The UK's first Indian restaurant, the Hindoostanee Coffee House, opened in 1810.[183][184] By 2003, there were as many as 10,000 restaurants serving Indian cuisine in England and Wales alone. According to Britain's Food Standards Agency, the Indian food industry in the United Kingdom is worth 3.2 billion pounds, accounts for two-thirds of all eating out and serves about 2.5 million customers every week.[185] </p>
<p> One of the best known examples of British Indian restaurant cuisine is Chicken tikka masala, which has also been called "a true British national dish."[186] </p>
<p> Ireland </p>
<p> Ireland's first Indian restaurant, the Indian Restaurant and Tea Rooms, opened in 1908 on Sackville Street, now O'Connell Street, in Dublin.[187] Today, Indian restaurants are commonplace in most Irish cities and towns. Non-Chinese Asians are the fastest growing ethnic group in Ireland.[188] </p>
<p> United States </p>
<p> A survey by The Washington Post in 2007 stated that more than 1,200 Indian food products had been introduced into the United States since 2000.[189] There are numerous Indian restaurants across the US, which vary based on regional culture and climate. North Indian and South Indian cuisines are especially well represented. Most Indian restaurants in the United States serve Americanized versions of North Indian food, which is generally less spicy than its Indian equivalents. </p>
<p> At sit-down restaurants with North Indian cuisine (the most common), complimentary papadum is served with three dipping sauces − typically hari chutney (mint and cilantro), imli chutney (taramind), and a spicy red chili or onion chutney − in place of European-style bread before the meal. </p>

<p> Hearty, delicious, comforting and EASY to make! This pork shoulder ragu is one of those dishes which simmers away for an afternoon on your stove top to transform a cheap cut of meat and few other ingredients into a richly flavored dinner perfect for a Sunday dinner, a snow day when you’re stuck inside, or company coming over since all the work is done hours before. </p>
<p> It’s time for some more slow cooked Italian comfort food here, and I couldn’t think of a better recipe than tender pork ragu! </p>
<p> Hello, all! </p>
<p> Today I have for a perfect wintry weather meal. The kind I love to make when I’m snowed in and puttering around the house. </p>
<p> My husband gets the fire going. I start braising and filling the air with amazing smells of Italian ragu. And we both (along with our daughter) periodically go out to clear off the driveway and walk, working up our appetites for the feast. </p>
<p> Pork Shoulder Ragu </p>
<p> While I’ve been making Beef Bolognese for decades now (I’m thinking it’s been about 20 years!), pork shoulder ragu is a relative newcomer. I’ve only been making this recipe for about 6 years. 😮 Hardly any time at all! I got the original recipe from Fine Cooking, and as soon I saw it in the magazine, I knew I had to try it. </p>
<p> I’m glad I did, since we all loved the combination of pork shoulder and pork sausage. It’s such a great mix having the two textures and the two variations in pork flavor combined together. While I’ve made a few changes over the years to adapt the recipe to our tastes, you can see that the basics of the recipe come right from them. </p>
<p> These days it’s in the snow day rotation, along with a few other comforting, slow braised meals which I pull out as soon as the forecast says the word Nor’easter. A word which everyone on the east coast of the US knows well! </p>
<p> It hasn’t been too bad here so far this year – actually, it’s been rather warm – but there have been some years when we heard that word on a weekly basis and the snow piled higher than our heads. </p>
<p> How do you make braised pork shoulder ragu? </p>
<p> To make pork shoulder ragu, braise chunks of pork shoulder and Italian sausage in a tomato and red wine sauce until the pork is falling apart. Once the pork is tender, shred it and return the pork to the sauce, adjusting the seasonings as needed. </p>
<p> 1. Start by browning the pork shoulder. This gives the meat another layer of flavor which will make the sauce richer. Move that to a plate while you get the rest going. </p>
<p> 2. Then get all the aromatics softened – onion, carrots, and garlic. Low and slow is the way to go here! </p>
<p> 3. Once they are all tender, add the wine and let it simmer for a bit. </p>
<p> 4. Now, you’re going to add in the tomatoes, the pork shoulder, and the sausage. Get that all to a gentle simmer and go sit by the fire! </p>
<p> 5. After the long, slow braise your pork will be falling apart. Give it a hand and shred it all up, then add it back to the pot. Adjust your seasonings, make some pasta (or potatoes or whatever you like to serve with ragu!), and EAT. </p>
<p> Can you make pork ragu ahead? </p>
<p> Yes, you can! </p>
<p> Not only is this pork ragu a great recipe to make on a day when it’s snowy out and you’re puttering about the house, but it’s one of those perfect made-ahead meals! </p>
<p> How so? </p>
<p> Have time to make it on Saturday, but want to serve it on Sunday? No worries! Just let it cool, then chill it overnight, and rewarm it again the next day! No fuss. No muss. </p>
<p> Can you double pork ragu? </p>
<p> Also, yes! </p>
<p> Want the benefit of all the slow braising for another meal (or four)? Divide the ragu into freezer bags, lay them flat, and stack them up. Pork ragu has just become a super quick weeknight meal that simply requires heating the sauce and boiling some water. </p>
<p> Can you make pork shoulder ragu in the slow cooker? </p>
<p> And, while I go for the slow braised in a pot cooking method, yes you can make this in a slow cooker! Several hours on low (6-7) will do you and then it’s into a pot after you shred the pork so the ragu can reduce and thicken. </p>
<p> However you make the ragu, remember that willpower is important. No matter how excellent it smells, it needs its braising time and you’ll just have to wait. </p>
<p> What sort of pasta should you serve with braised pork ragu? </p>
<p> As for the pasta, a short or skinny pasta (like spaghetti) will work fine. The pasta police won’t come after you. At least I don’t think they will… </p>
<p> But I think a wide noodle is best with a chunky ragu! Fettuccine or pappardelle or tagliatelle. They balance each other and I especially like the way the pappardelle fold over the sauce so you get a forkful of pasta surrounding some of the sauce and pork. </p>
<p> Not that I make fresh pappardelle all the time! </p>
<p> Usually I go with a dry fettuccini or pappardelle. But, I’ve been working on my fresh pasta making lately and wrote up a step by step guide to basic, fresh pasta, and I figured it was good time to practice. </p>
<p> Since I know that sounds like a lot of work, I should note that I took advantage of the ragu’s easy reheating and made the ragu on day 1, which I then reheated while I made the pasta on day 2. Though, since 99% of the work in making ragu is done hours before, you could totally make pasta the same day. </p>
<p> My daughter and I have made the pasta and sauce together several times with Bolognese. I had to take photos, so spreading out was the way to go for me. </p>
<p> I will say that with the rich, beautiful pork shoulder ragu and the fresh pappardelle (and a lovely glass of red wine), I felt like I was in a great Italian restaurant. The only difference was we had to do the washing up after dinner, but we also started a fire so it balanced out. </p>
<p> A roaring fire, a glass of wine, snowflakes coming down, and pork ragu. Sounds like a perfect winter evening to me. </p>

<p> Italian Braised Pork Shoulder Ragu </p>
<p> Italian comfort food of tomato, braised sausage, and pork shoulder ragu simmering on the stove is the perfect way to spend a chilly day. This pork ragu is easily doubled and freezes well. </p>
<p> 2 lbs dried or fresh pasta, preferably thick noodles like fettucini </p>
<p> shredded parmesan cheese, for topping </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a large pot, heat the olive oil on medium-high heat. Season the pork shoulder with salt and pepper. Once the oil is shimmering, add the pork and sear it all all sides until browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the pork to a bowl and set aside. </p>
<p> Reduce the heat to low. Add the onion, carrots, and garlic along with another sprinkle of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion is soft, but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add the wine and increase the heat to medium-high again. Let the wine boil for about 5 minutes, then stir in the tomatoes and herbs. </p>
<p> Now add back in the pork shoulder. Then break up the sausage into small clumps and drop them into the sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, then cover the pot and lower the heat to keep it at a simmer. Simmer the sauce for 3 - 3 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the pork is tender and pulls apart easily. </p>
<p> Remove the chunks of pork shoulder from the sauce and shred them by pulling the pieces between two forks. Once the pork is shredded, add it back to the pot. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt, pepper, and/or herbs as needed. Let the sauce continue to gently simmer uncovered on low while you cook the pasta. </p>
<p> Heat up a large pot of well salted water. Add the pasta to the water and cook until it is done to your liking. Scoop out about 1 cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta. Return the pasta to the pot you cooked it in and add about 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Then ladle in some of the pork ragu. Simmer the pasta and ragu together for a few minutes, adding more pasta water if needed, until you have a thick sauce which coats the pasta. </p>
<p> Serve the pasta with more ragu over the top and pass around the parmesan cheese. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> This recipe doubles easily and freezes well. I often make a double recipe, then portion out the sauce into freezer bags, and lay them flat in the freezer for ease of stacking and quick defrosting. </p>
<p> If you want a bit of heat, switch out all or part of the sweet sausage for hot Italian sausage. </p>
<p> I prefer a thicker tomato sauce, so I use crushed tomatoes. For a thinner sauce, use only whole tomatoes. </p>
<p> The sauce can be cooked on the stove top or in the oven. If you want to cook it in the oven, heat the oven to 325F, bring the sauce to a good simmer on the stove top, then cover the pot and let braise for the 3 - 3 1/2 hour cooking time. </p>
<p> The sauce can also be cooked in the slow cooker. Cook it through step 2, then transfer it to the slow cooker for 6-7 hours on low. Once it's done transfer the ragu back to a pot, shred the pork, and let it simmer and thicken on the stove top. </p>

<p> Comments </p>
<p> Yes, it would. There may be more fat in the pork belly, so you might want to skim it off before eating but the meat will be wonderful in the sauce. </p>
<p> Hi I currently have a boneless picnic shoulder with the knitting on it do you think I could just throw it in the sauce and let it slow cook in there or in the Crock-Pot… then take it out cut the net off and put it back in the sauce? Or should I just cut the net off an cut into a couple of pieces first…. or is this not a good cut of meat to use for this recipe? </p>
<p> Pork picnic is a great cut for the sauce! Cut off the netting, trim the fat, and cut it into a few chunks (just as you would the shoulder) and you’ll be good to go. No need to cook it separately in the crock pot. </p>
<p> A million thank you’s for this wonderful and flavorful recipe. The sauce was so rich and delicious. I just shredded the pork and YUM! Another hour and it will surely be heaven for my Christmas lunch. Happy Holidays! </p>
<p> Ragus are wonderfully adjustable recipes and I think the veal would be very tasty. It won’t have the same flavor as sausage of course, so I would add some fennel to the sauce which will give a similar flavor profile. </p>
<p> Make this and put it on a pan fried or griddled garlic parmesan polenta cake along with a dollop of ricotta cheese that has lots of black pepper and fresh basil and parsely… one of the best apps you can make at home </p>
<p> This was amazing. Thank you! I served atop a bed of farro, with broccolini sautéed in olive oil, garlic, and crushed red peppers on the side. </p>
<p> I made this today and we loved it! I really appreciate the crockpot variation. With two toddlers, it’s much easier to be able to do the stove steps during morning nap and put everything in the crockpot until dinner time. I agree with the commenter who said that the addition of the sausage really adds dimension. </p>
<p> Take a look back at step 2 and you’ll see that I direct you to stir in the tomatoes after letting the wine boil. </p>
<p> Has anyone tried making this in a crockpot? Maybe sear the pork shoulder before placing in there for 8 hours on low? </p>
<p> Made this the night before thanksgiving for a Friendsgiving, and man oh man! What a great little recipe! Only thing I changed was that I simmered a Parmesan rind in with the sauce. This was a fantastic recipe and everyone loved it with some home made pasta noodles! I’ll be saving this and doing it again for sure! Thank you! </p>
<p> I’ve tried many recipes for pork ragu. All seemed to be lacking in one way or another, and had to be doctored up. Not so with this recipe…perhaps due to the inclusion of sausage, which amped up the flavor profile. Only changes I made…fresh thyme and fresh rosemary, because I had both on hand. Threw in a parmesan rind and simmered in oven at 300 degrees for @ 3 hours instead of stovetop. Absolutely delicious. </p>
<p> Love the idea of using the parmesan rind! I always save them for my soups. And the oven is definitely a more hands off way of cooking the ragu. Thank you for letting me know how it came out, Christina. 🙂 </p>
<p> I’m sorry, but I don’t yet have an instant pot and would have no idea how to adapt the recipe. </p>
<p> I’m curious about the idea of adding puréed tomatoes AND crushed tomatoes. It also feels like a lot of tomatoes. Did you mean either / or? </p>
<p> I do mean two 28 oz cans of tomatoes – one can whole tomatoes and one can crushed. 🙂 Also, there is 2 and 1/2 lbs of meat in the recipe. There is definitely tomato, but I find it to be quite balanced. You can certainly add one can and see what you think. </p>
<p> Hi there! This recipe looks fantastic. I have a large pork loin in my freezer that I was hoping to use for this recipe instead of buying a pork shoulder. Do you have any concerns or suggestions? Thanks! Lisa </p>
<p> Thanks! As for using pork loin, I have made shredded pork with it in the slow cooker so I think it would work just the same here. The cook time might be a little different, but you can keep an eye on it and check it every so often. One good thing about pork loin is that you will have less fat to skim off at the end. Good luck! 🙂 </p>
<p> This looks amazing. Can’t wait to try it. I’ve pinned and printed the recipe to make this week. </p>
<p> Sounds wonderful. I’d want to cook fat out of the sausage before adding it to the stew and it looks like you didn’t do that, right? </p>
<p> No, I didn’t. Just make sure you don’t brown the sausage. That will change how it works in the sauce and it won’t melt in the way it should. 🙂 </p>
<p> I love a wide noodle too Your pappardelle takes this dish from homey to sexy. Looks delish! </p>

<p> Traditional Italian Bread </p>
<p> Bread expert Elizabeth Yetter has been baking bread for more than 20 years, bringing her Pennsylvania Dutch Country experiences to life through recipes. </p>
<p> *The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a food serving contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice. </p>
<p> (Nutrition information is calculated using an ingredient database and should be considered an estimate.) </p>
<p> Traditional Italian bread is moist, has a thin, crisp crust, and works well with any meal. If you haven't tried baking fresh Italian bread yet, this simple recipe will get you started. </p>
<p> At breakfast, this bread is perfect for scooping up the egg yolk on your plate. Pair it in the Italian way with fruit compote and a dark coffee with a splash of milk to start your day or serve with lunch or dinner alongside pasta or soups. It also works well in a hoagie or even as a pizza-bread base. </p>
<p> When sliced thin, use it to make little French toasts, or as the base of hors d'oeuvres topped with either membrillo paste and Manchego cheese, or ricotta, honey, and pumpkin seeds. </p>
<p> Steps to Make It </p>
<p> Making the Dough </p>
<p> Gather the ingredients. </p>
<p> In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, salt, yeast, and warm water. </p>
<p> Stir in the softened butter or margarine. </p>
<p> Sift in one cup of flour at the time until you have a dough that can be easily kneaded by hand without sticking to your hands. </p>
<p> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8 minutes, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is soft and not sticky. </p>
<p> Lightly grease a medium-sized bowl with olive oil and flip dough over so that the top is also greased. </p>
<p> Cover with a clean kitchen towel or wrap paper and let rise for 30 minutes in a warm, draft-free place. </p>
<p> Proofing a Second Time </p>
<p> Grease a large baking sheet and sprinkle it with coarse cornmeal, if desired. </p>
<p> Remove the dough from the bowl, place onto a lightly floured table, and divide into two equal parts. </p>
<p> Roll each dough half into an approximately 15 x 9-inch rectangle. </p>
<p> Roll the dough tightly along the 15-inch side, pinch the seams, and taper the ends of each loaf with your hands at a 45-degree angle. </p>
<p> Place the loaves on the prepared baking sheet and cover. Let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Baking the Bread </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 425 F. </p>
<p> Make 3 deep diagonal slashes on each loaf. </p>
<p> Bake the bread for 20 minutes. </p>
<p> Lightly beat the egg white and cold water in a small bowl to create an egg wash. This step is key for a traditional Italian bread. </p>
<p> Remove the loaves from the oven and brush with the egg wash. </p>
<p> Return the loaves to the oven for another 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Serve bread warm or cold and enjoy. </p>
<p> Italian Bread Basics </p>
<p> You may have had Italian bread before, but it's important to know what characteristics you can expect it to have: </p>
<p> The inside is moist, thick, and very absorbent, perfect for soaking up soup, sauces, and oils. </p>
<p> Italian bread tends to be an elongated oval shape, not too thin and not too thick. </p>
<p> Unlike French bread, which tends to be sweet, Italian bread often has a savory taste that adds to its versatility. </p>
<p> Italian bread dough is typically wetter than other doughs because it uses more liquid (water or milk) and fat (butter or olive oil). </p>
<p> Despite its savory flavor, many Italian bread recipes do use sugar. </p>
<p> Traditionally, Italian bread is baked on a stone to give it that signature thin crisp crust, golden brown in color. </p>
<p> Italian breads baked in wood ovens have a smokier flavor. </p>
<p> I don't like this at all. It's not the worst. Sure, this will do. I'm a fan—would recommend. Amazing! I love it! Thanks for your rating! </p>

<p> Easy Baked Italian Breaded Pork Chops </p>
<p> Share </p>
<p> Italian Breaded Pork Chops, a delicious Family Dinner Meal. Pork chops baked not fried in a yummy Parmesan Breaded coating, makes this dish a healthy alternative. An Easy weeknight or weekend dinner idea. </p>
<p> Breaded Pork Chops </p>
<p> One thing we all agree on is we love Pork Chops. I first had these pork chops years ago when my sister-in-law made them. Although she fried them and I decided that I would prefer them baked. </p>
<p> OK maybe not prefer them baked, because they certainly are yummy fried, but let’s face it baked is healthier. And one pan makes them so easy. </p>
<p> How to Make Italian Bread Pork Chops: </p>
<p> On a large plate mix together the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, salt and freshly chopped parsley. </p>
<p> Coat the pork chops very well with the crumb mixture one at a time, </p>
<p> Place the chops on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, lightly drizzle the paper with a little olive oil. </p>
<p> Sprinkle the chops with a little salt and drizzle with olive oil. </p>
<p> Bake in a pre-heated oven for approximately 30 minutes, halfway through baking turn the chops over sprinkle with a little salt, (in the last 5 minutes I raised the temperature to 390°/200°), for extra browning. </p>
<p> Let the chops sit 3-5 minutes before serving. </p>
<p> How long to Bake Pork Chops for: </p>
<p> Depending on the thickness of the chop be sure to bake them for about 30 minutes at 375F (190C). </p>
<p> If you aren’t sure if the Baked Pork Chops are cooked thoroughly then you can measure the internal temperature of the meat. Make sure that it has reached 145F (62C). </p>
<p> Also let the Pork Chop rest for 3-4 minutes before serving. </p>
<p> What are the best type of Pork Chops for baking? </p>
<p> You can use either boneless or bone in Pork Chops. Personally a thick cut 1 to 1 1/2 inch chop is the best for baking and thinner and you will have a dry breaded chop. Not too delicious. </p>
<p> How to Store the Baked Breaded Pork Chops: </p>
<p> Any leftover pork chops should be stored in an air tight container in the fridge for up to three days. Or they can be frozen for up to three months. </p>
<p> What to serve with these Italian Baked Breaded Pork Chops: </p>
<p> Bread Crumbs tossed with freshly grated parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley take these Breaded Pork Chops to another level. So Good. </p>
<p> They come out crunchy on the outside and nice and moist on the inside. Amazingly delicious! Try them, trust me, you won’t regret it. Buon Appetito! </p>

<p> Hi Rose, Can you tell me how thick the pork chops should be? Also they look like rib chops. </p>
<p> Hi Patricia, I don’t think they are rib chops, but they are thick cut chops (bone in). Hope that helps. </p>
<p> No shaming please.😀. I ran out of Shake and Bake. Decided to be a modern woman and find a recipe online. My home smells wonderful! Can’t wait to serve up your recipe. Loved your story too. Thank you, Rosemary. </p>
<p> Hi Savannah, no shaming whatsoever! I love the stuff lol. Thanks so much I hope you enjoyed it. 🙂 </p>
<p> Trying the recipe now I didn’t add the parmesan cheese because I didn’t have it. Do you think it’ll still taste good? </p>
<p> Hi Valerie, I think it will still taste good, although the Parmesan does give it a nice flavour. Let me know. </p>
<p> I will try your pork chops tomorrow afternoon. .Sound scrumptious. Thanks for the great recipes. </p>
<p> Tryed them that way before,but found dipping them in a beaten egg with salt and pepper, then the bread crumbs makes them taste even better……….. Also wanted to ask if you have a recipe for fulitella? </p>
<p> Hi Joan, good idea, although I’m not too crazy about the taste of food dipped in egg and then baked fried ok. I’m sorry Joan I have never heard of fulitella, it must be dialect, what exactly is it and where is it from? 🙂 </p>
<p> Thanks for this recipe. I wrote a post on my blog this morning about how to use pork chops that you buy at Costco and I included a link to your recipe. Have you ever tried brining your pork before breading them? </p>
<p> Hi Eric, thanks for including my recipe. I have never tried brining, but now I think I will give it a go. Have a great weekend. </p>

<p> Italian Breaded Pork Chops </p>
<p> My father's side of the family is Sicilian, and has been making these pork chops for at least 3 generations. My husband frequently requests these over my marinated and grilled pork chops when I give him a choice. If you do not have an oven-proof skillet, you may cook the chops on the stove at medium-low. </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> In a small bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. In a separate small bowl, mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and parsley. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook until lightly browned. Remove garlic, reserving for other uses. </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Dip each pork chop into the egg mixture, then into the bread crumb mixture, coating evenly. Place coated pork chops in the skillet, and brown abut 5 minutes on each side. </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Place the skillet and pork chops in the preheated oven, and cook 25 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). </p>

<p> Love it, love it love it. Seasoned italian bread crumbs are wonderful, I just added 1 tsp each of garlic powder and italian seasoning. I browned them olive oil 2 minutes on each side, then placed them on a roasting rack in the oven to finish. It was much less greasy and the rack allowed both sides to remain crispy. Read More </p>

<p> I used 1 inch thick pork chops and increased the oven temp to 375. I bypassed the skillet altogether, and baked the chops on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes. Perfect every time. I use this same method for oven fried chicken. No oil required and use Egg Beaters instead of eggs. I also dredged the chops in flour then egg then breadcrumbs. I also added fresh parsley instead of green dried confetti. You can also substitute Italian breadcrumbs for panko and it makes for extra crispy crust. Read More </p>

<p> I love these, the method was the most useful thing. I dipped in the egg wash and batter twice. My husband loves these. I beat the heck out of my chops first, so I only get about 3 to a large skillet. I was very happy with this. I also coat the raw plain chops with a flour salt pepper mix then the egg wash then bread crumb mixture. The flour binds with the egg to keep the breading on a bit better.

<p> EXCELLENT!! I've never been able to make good pork chops, but now I have a great recipe to fall back on. I followed some of the other suggestions about cutting back on the bread crumbs/egg mixtures and also dredged the chops in flour mixed with salt and pepper before dunking in eggs and bread crumbs. Also, if you do not know if your skillet is ovenproof, you can double wrap the handle in aluminum foil in order to make it ovenproof. Read More </p>
<p> As suggested by others I dredged the pork chops in flour before dunking them in the egg mixture which I cut to just 1 egg and a couple tablespoons of milk. Also I put the bread crumbs and cheese in a zip top baggie and then did a shake 'n bake type thing. I find it coats the chops better. My husband and I both fully enjoyed these pork chops. They were very easy to make and very moist. Read More </p>
<p> I've always made my pork chops this way-lots of flavor and very tender. However, if you have left-over egg mixture...add the left-over bread crumb mixture to it and cook it in the frying pan after the chops are done. When mixing the two together, you need a slightly pourable consistency, so adjust accordingly, more milk or more bread crumbs as needed. Once it's in the pan, just spread it out a bit with your spatula. Let it cook for a few minutes and then, using your spatula, cut it into 'pie wedges' and flip over and finish cooking till it's lightly browned. Serve it on the platter with your chops. My mom and her mom before her never wasted anything. My 6 brothers and sisters and I grew up loving it, as did my 4 children and their friends. Just a nice little side dish, especially if you don't have a lot of meat to go around. Mom just called it 'egg and cracker'. (...and yes, I'm sure it's probably not the healthiest side dish, just thought I'd offer it up as an alternative to dumping it all down the sink) Read More </p>
<p> I used 1 inch thick pork chops and increased the oven temp to 375. I bypassed the skillet altogether, and baked the chops on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes. Perfect every time. I use this same method for oven fried chicken. No oil required and use Egg Beaters instead of eggs. I also dredged the chops in flour then egg then breadcrumbs. I also added fresh parsley instead of green dried confetti. You can also substitute Italian breadcrumbs for panko and it makes for extra crispy crust. Read More </p>
<p> I never breaded my pork chops before but since husband came along, he loves them that way so this was my attempt. These came out just as advertised but I should have read more of the reviews and went with 1 less egg and half of the bread crumbs (although it did make it quick and easy to bread with all of those crumbs!) I did transfer to a glass casserole for baking and easy table presentation. Might add ground rosemary next time. The 2 T. olive oil probably could have been 3-4 T. They did come out looking picture perfect though and hub must've complimented them more than anything else I've made (and I cook a lot). Thanks for the really easy recipe to get all that praise for!

<p> Terriffic recipe! My husband loved it too, and he's a picky eater. However, I substituted SLICED garlic for the chopped, because it's easier to remove from the oil, rather than trying to retrieve a bunch of little garlic pieces from hot oil! Also, I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning blend to the milk/egg mixture. I will DEFINATELY use this recipe on a regular basis! THANK YOU! Read More </p>

<p> Love it, love it love it. Seasoned italian bread crumbs are wonderful, I just added 1 tsp each of garlic powder and italian seasoning. I browned them olive oil 2 minutes on each side, then placed them on a roasting rack in the oven to finish. It was much less greasy and the rack allowed both sides to remain crispy. </p>

<p> I love these, the method was the most useful thing. I dipped in the egg wash and batter twice. My husband loves these. I beat the heck out of my chops first, so I only get about 3 to a large skillet. I was very happy with this. I also coat the raw plain chops with a flour salt pepper mix then the egg wash then bread crumb mixture. The flour binds with the egg to keep the breading on a bit better. I learned this from a breaded chicken recipe and it works. </p>

<p> Italian Breaded Pork Chops </p>

<p> These Italian Breaded Pork Chops are a classic Italian entree. Perfectly golden brown and crispy on the outside but moist and packed full on flavor on the inside, these are about to become your newest favorite mid week meal. </p>
<p> Pork Chops </p>
<p> I don’t think pork chops get enough love. They’re totally juicy and moist, packed full of flavor, and such a perfect protein punch when prepared correctly. If you’ve never tried to bread pork chops before, then do I ever have the most perfectly scrumptious dinner for you! </p>
<p> Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside – what could possible be better? If you have some chops taking up space in your freezer and you want a way to prepare them that will get the entire family salivating, this recipe is the only answer you need. </p>
<p> Italian Breaded Pork Chops </p>
<p> Truth be told, I’m kind of old fashioned when it comes to pork chops, at least I used to be until a few years ago. In my family we always used to cook them forever, literally for at least an hour in the oven. Times have changed, and I’m here to show you how to cook perfect pork chops that are juicy and flavorful with a perfectly crispy coating. </p>
<p> Now this recipe is by no means new, it is a classic Italian way to prepare chops, dating back more generations than I can count! You may not see this dish on Italian menus when you go out to eat, but believe me it’s the main event in its own right. </p>
<p> Ingredients In Italian Breaded Pork Chops </p>
<p> Detailed measurements and instructions can be found on the printable recipe card at the bottom of the page. </p>
<p> Pork – Pork chops, boneless and 1 inch in diameter. </p>
<p> Eggs – 2 whole eggs beaten. </p>
<p> Milk – Any fat percentage you’d like! </p>
<p> Breadcrumbs – Any kind you prefer! For this recipe I prefer to use Italian breadcrumbs, but Panko would work as well. </p>
<p> Spices – Italian seasoning and garlic powder. </p>
<p> Cheese – Parmesan cheese to incorporate into our dredge. Believe me you need this in your life. </p>
<p> Olive oil – This is how we’re going to saute our sauteables today. </p>
<p> Seasoning – Salt and pepper. </p>
<p> How To Make Italian Breaded Pork Chops </p>
<p> Detailed measurements and instructions can be found on the printable recipe card at the bottom of the page. </p>
<p> In a small bowl, beat together the eggs, the milk, 1/2 tsp of the salt and 1/2 tsp of the pepper. In a separate small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, parsley and remaining 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. </p>
<p> Heat the olive oil in a large, oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Dip each pork chop into the egg mixture, then into the bread crumb mixture, coating evenly. Place coated pork chops in the skillet, and brown abut 4 to 6 minutes on each side. </p>
<p> If using a meat thermometer, check the internal temperature and cook until they reach 135 F degrees. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let them rest for 10 minutes before slicing into them. The residual heat will bring the temperature up to 145 F degrees. </p>
<p> How To Make Your Own Breadcrumbs </p>
<p> If you’d like to try out making your own, I won’t stop you! I mean I always say that homemade is always better, so why not test out that theory with this seemingly small but monumentally important ingredient! </p>
<p> All you need are 10 slices of bread, ground down in a food processor, from there just: </p>
<p> Spread the breadcrumbs on a baking tray and place in your preheated oven. </p>
<p> Bake at 300 F degrees for 10 minutes or until the crumbs are golden and completely dry, stir occasionally. </p>
<p> Cool completely on the baking sheet before incorporating. </p>
<p> What Temperature Is Pork Safe to Eat? </p>
<p> I know that a lot of you may have a fear of undercooked pork. While this was a major issue a few decades ago, standards for pork have increased immensely and these health risks aren’t much to worry about anymore. The standard for fully cooked and safe pork is now 145 F. This is wonderful because at the old standard of 170F, pork ended up being incredibly dry and chewy. </p>
<p> I highly suggest getting yourself an instant read thermometer! You can use it with any type of meat, breads, oil, etc. It comes in handy almost every day for me. If you prefer your pork more than 145 F, that is totally okay. It’s your dinner after all! </p>
<p> Tips For Making The Best Italian Pork Chops </p>
<p> This is the best way to transform simple every day ingredients into something really special. You won’t have to spend so much time and money at the grocery store to have a wonderful dinner. </p>
<p> Here are some tips to make sure you get the best results with your chops: </p>
<p> Both boneless or bone-in pork chops can be used. I prefer the thick cut ones, which I find at Costco. </p>
<p> Pork chops cook quickly so make sure to not overcook them. To properly cook them, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, don’t rely blindly on cooking time. Make sure the thermometer reads 145F to ensure your chops are fully cooked and till nice and juicy. Cooking time can vary based on the thickness of the pork chops. </p>
<p> Let your chops rest for about 30 minutes on the counter before cooking them so they come to room temp. This will ensure they cook evenly on the inside and the center reaches the perfect temperature. </p>
<p> Let your chops rest for at least 10 minutes after they come off the skillet. If you cut into them too early, the juices will come out and leave the chops dry. </p>
<p> How to Store Pork Chops </p>
<p> Store in an airtight container or ziploc bag. Make sure the pork chops have cooled down before storing them. They will last 3-4 days in the fridge or 2-3 months in the freezer. To reheat, you can either heat on the stovetop in a skillet over medium heat or in the oven at 375 F. Keep in mind that reheating cooked pork will cause it to dry out and it is best served fresh. </p>
<p> What Can I Serve With My Breaded Pork Chops? </p>
<p> I mean if you want you can eat these succulent, juicy chops all on their own – I won’t judge. But I suppose some of you would like to make this into a big ole spread. Well in that case Jo has you covered with some scintillating sides: </p>

<p> Recipe Notes </p>
<p> If your pork chops are thicker, you may need to finish cooking them in an oven. To do so, place the skillet and pork chops in a 350 F preheated oven, and cook 15 to 20 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 135 degrees F (63 degrees C). If using a meat thermometer, check the internal temperature and cook until they reach 135 F degrees. Transfer pork chops to a cutting board and let them rest for 10 minutes before slicing into them. The residual heat will bring the temperature up to 145 F degrees. </p>

<p> Italian cuisine </p>
<p> "Italian restaurant" redirects here. For the television series, see Italian Restaurant. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients.[9] Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.[10] Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated with variations throughout the country. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not unite until the 19th century, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BC. Food and culture were very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook (Apicius) which dates back to first century BC.[11] Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval, and the discovery of the New World have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. Regional cuisine is represented by some of the major cities in Italy. For example, Milan (north of Italy) is known for its risottos, Bologna (the central/middle of the country) is known for its tortellini and Naples (the south) is famous for its pizzas[12] and spaghettis. </p>
<p> The first known Italian food writer was a Greek Sicilian named Archestratus from Syracuse in the 4th century BC. He wrote a poem that spoke of using "top quality and seasonal" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by spices, herbs or other seasonings. He placed importance on simple preparation of fish.[13] </p>
<p> With culinary traditions from Rome and Athens, a cuisine developed in Sicily that some consider the first real Italian cuisine.[citation needed] Arabs invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing spinach, almonds, and rice.[14] During the 12th century, a Norman king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from flour and water called atriya, which eventually became trii, a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy.[15] Normans also introduced the casserole, salt cod (baccalà), and stockfish, all of which remain popular.[16] </p>
<p> Food preservation was either chemical or physical, as refrigeration did not exist. Meats and fish were smoked, dried, or kept on ice. Brine and salt were used to pickle items such as herring, and to cure pork. Root vegetables were preserved in brine after they had been parboiled. Other means of preservation included oil, vinegar, or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, liquor, honey, and sugar were used.[17] </p>
<p> The northern Italian regions show a mix of Germanic and Roman culture while the south reflects Arab[14] influence, as much Mediterranean cuisine was spread by Arab trade.[18] The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century Liber de coquina written in Naples. Dishes include "Roman-style" cabbage (ad usum romanorum), ad usum campanie which were "small leaves" prepared in the "Campanian manner", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a torta, compositum londardicum which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman pastello, Lasagna pie, and call for the use of salt from Sardinia or Chioggia.[19] </p>
<p> In the 15th century, Maestro Martino was chef to the Patriarch of Aquileia at the Vatican. His Libro de arte coquinaria describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for Maccaroni Siciliani, made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in capon stock flavored with saffron, displaying Persian influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.[16] The Roman recipes include coppiette (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His Florentine dishes include eggs with Bolognese torta, Sienese torta and Genoese recipes such as piperata (sweets), macaroni, squash, mushrooms, and spinach pie with onions.[20] </p>
<p> The courts of Florence, Rome, Venice, and Ferrara were central to the cuisine. Cristoforo di Messisbugo, steward to Ippolito d'Este, published Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.[22] </p>
<p> In 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to Pope Pius V, wrote his Opera in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game. </p>
<p> Recipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head, and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in Lent. These fish recipes are simple, including poaching, broiling, grilling, and frying after marination. </p>
<p> Particular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters, and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan pizza (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not yet been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as corn (maize) and turkey are included.[23] </p>
<p> In the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti (A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs, and Fruit), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from Modena, Castelvetro moved to England because he was a Protestant. The book lists Italian vegetables and fruits along with their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just as accompaniments.[23] Castelvetro favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, lemon juice, verjus, or orange juice. He also suggested roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and truffles in the winter, detailing the use of pigs in the search for truffles.[23] </p>
<p> L'arte di Ben Cucinare published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662 </p>
<p> In 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the Duchy of Mantua, published L'Arte di Ben Cucinare. He was the first to offer a section on vitto ordinario ("ordinary food"). The book described a banquet given by Duke Charles for Queen Christina of Sweden, with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used), and a napkin.[24] </p>
<p> Other books from this time, such as Galatheo by Giovanni della Casa, tell how scalci ("waiters") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.[24] </p>
<p> At the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than French cuisine. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to bourgeois housewives.[25] Periodicals in booklet form such as La cuoca cremonese (The Cook of Cremona) in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish, and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity, and frequency.[26] </p>
<p> In the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.[27] </p>
<p> In 1779, Antonio Nebbia from Macerata in the Marche region, wrote Il Cuoco Maceratese (The Cook of Macerata). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and pasta, rice, and gnocchi. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats. </p>
<p> In 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's Il Cuoco Galante (The Courteous Cook) gave particular emphasis to vitto pitagorico (vegetarian food). "Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because Pythagoras, as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious." This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes. </p>
<p> Tomatoes are a typical part of Italian cuisine, but only entered common usage in the late 18th century.[28] </p>
<p> Zuppa alli pomidoro in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan pappa al pomodoro. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a "Treatise on the Potato" after the French Antoine-Augustin Parmentier's successful promotion of the tuber.[29] In 1790, Francesco Leonardi in his book L'Apicio moderno ("Modern Apicius") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato-based sauce.[30] </p>
<p> In the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to King Victor Emmanuel, wrote A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie with recipes "suitable for a modest household". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as Genoese Cappon Magro. In 1829, Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico by Giovanni Felice Luraschi featured Milanese dishes such as kidney with anchovies and lemon and gnocchi alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's La Cucina Genovese in 1871 addressed the cuisine of Liguria. This book contained the first recipe for pesto. La Cucina Teorico-Pratica written by Ippolito Cavalcanti described the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.[31] </p>
<p> La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene (The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well), by Pellegrino Artusi, first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes predominantly originate from Romagna and Tuscany, where he lived. </p>
<p> Pesto, a Ligurian sauce made out of basil, olive oil and pine nuts, and which can be eaten with pasta or other dishes such as soup. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or baccalà), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy.[32][33] Italians like their ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.[34] </p>
<p> In Northern Italy though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so.[35] Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes. Basil (found in pesto), nuts, and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham (prosciutto), sausage (cotechino), different sorts of salami, truffles, grana, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes (Bolognese sauce or ragù). </p>
<p> Olive oil is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Italian cooking, and as the basis for sauces, often replaces animal fats of butter or lard.[36] </p>
<p> Traditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In Tuscany, pasta (especially pappardelle) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In Southern Italy, tomatoes (fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, oranges, ricotta cheese, eggplants, zucchini, certain types of fish (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths, and shapes. Most pastas may be distinguished by the shapes for which they are named—penne, maccheroni, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli, lasagne, and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like ravioli and tortellini. </p>
<p> The word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names. </p>
<p> Examples include spaghetti (thin rods), rigatoni (tubes or cylinders), fusilli (swirls), and lasagne (sheets). Dumplings, like gnocchi (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like spätzle, are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy. </p>
<p> Pasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from durum wheat flour or durum wheat semolina, and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety. </p>
<p> Durum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked al dente (Italian: firm to the bite, meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used. </p>
<p> Particular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as pizzoccheri, are made from buckwheat flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (pasta all'uovo "egg pasta"). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour. </p>
<p> Each area has its own specialties, primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics.[37] Italian cuisine is also seasonal with priority placed on the use of fresh produce.[38][39] </p>
<p> Pasta, meat, and vegetables are central to the cuisine of Abruzzo and Molise. Chili peppers (peperoncini) are typical of Abruzzo, where they are called diavoletti ("little devils") for their spicy heat. Due to the long history of shepherding in Abruzzo and Molise, lamb dishes are common. Lamb is often paired with pasta.[40] Mushrooms (usually wild mushrooms), rosemary, and garlic are also extensively used in Abruzzese cuisine. </p>
<p> Best-known is the extra virgin olive oil produced in the local farms on the hills of the region, marked by the quality level DOP and considered one of the best in the country.[41] Renowned wines like Montepulciano DOCG and Trebbiano d'Abruzzo DOC are considered amongst the world's finest wines.[42] In 2012 a bottle of Trebbiano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane ranked #1 in the top 50 Italian wine award.[43] Centerbe ("Hundred Herbs") is a strong (72% alcohol), spicy herbal liqueur drunk by the locals. Another liqueur is genziana, a soft distillate of gentian roots. </p>
<p> The best-known dish from Abruzzo is arrosticini, little pieces of castrated lamb on a wooden stick and cooked on coals. The chitarra (literally "guitar") is a fine stringed tool that pasta dough is pressed through for cutting. In the province of Teramo, famous local dishes include the virtù soup (made with legumes, vegetables, and pork meat), the timballo (pasta sheets filled with meat, vegetables or rice), and the mazzarelle (lamb intestines filled with garlic, marjoram, lettuce, and various spices). The popularity of saffron, grown in the province of L'Aquila, has waned in recent years.[40] The most famous dish of Molise is cavatelli, a long shaped, handmade maccheroni-type pasta made of flour, semolina, and water, often served with meat sauce, broccoli, or mushrooms. Pizzelle cookies are a common dessert, especially around Christmas. </p>
<p> Apulia is a massive food producer: major production includes wheat, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers, potatoes, spinach, eggplants, cauliflower, fennel, endive, chickpeas, lentils, beans, and cheese (like the traditional caciocavallo cheese). Apulia is also the largest producer of olive oil in Italy. The sea offers abundant fish and seafood that are extensively used in the regional cuisine, especially oysters, and mussels. </p>
<p> Goat and lamb are occasionally used.[44] The region is known for pasta made from durum wheat and traditional pasta dishes featuring orecchiette-type pasta, often served with tomato sauce, potatoes, mussels, or broccoli rabe. Pasta with cherry tomatoes and arugula is also popular.[45] </p>
<p> Regional desserts include zeppola, doughnuts usually topped with powdered sugar and filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream, or a butter-and-honey mixture. For Christmas, Apulians make a very traditional rose-shaped pastry called cartellate. These are fried and dipped in vin cotto, which is either a wine or fig juice reduction. </p>
<p> The cuisine of Basilicata is mostly based on inexpensive ingredients and deeply anchored in rural traditions. </p>
<p> Pork is an integral part of the regional cuisine,[citation needed] often made into sausages or roasted on a spit. Famous dry sausages from the region are lucanica and soppressata. Wild boar, mutton, and lamb are also popular. Pasta sauces are generally based on meats or vegetables. Spicy peperoncini is largely used, as well as the so-called peperoni cruschi ("crunchy peppers").[46] The region produces cheeses like Pecorino di Filiano, Canestrato di Molitern, Pallone di Gravina, and Paddraccio and olive oils like the Vulture.[47] </p>
<p> Basilicata is known for spaghetti-like pasta troccoli and capunti,[48] a thick and short oval pasta whose shape is often compared to that of an open empty pea pod. Capunti are usually served with a hearty vegetable tomato sauce or various meat sauces. </p>
<p> The most famous wine of the region is the Aglianico del Vulture, others include Matera, Terre dell'Alta Val d'Agri and Grottino di Roccanova.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Basilicata is also known for its mineral waters which are sold widely in Italy. The springs are mostly located in the volcanic basin of the Vulture area.[51] </p>
<p> In Calabria, a history of French rule under the House of Anjou and Napoleon, along with Spanish influences, affected the language and culinary skills as seen in the naming of things such as cake, gatò, from the French gateau. Seafood includes swordfish, shrimp, lobster, sea urchin, and squid. Macaroni-type pasta is widely used in regional dishes, often served with goat, beef, or pork sauce and salty ricotta.[52] </p>
<p> Main courses include frìttuli (prepared by boiling pork rind, meat, and trimmings in pork fat), different varieties of spicy sausages (like Nduja and Capicola), goat, and land snails. Melon and watermelon are traditionally served in a chilled fruit salad or wrapped in ham.[53] Calabrian wines include Greco di Bianco, Bivongi, Cirò, Dominici, Lamezia, Melissa, Pollino, Sant'Anna di Isola Capo Rizzuto, San Vito di Luzzi, Savuto, Scavigna, and Verbicaro. </p>
<p> Calabrese pizza has a Neapolitan-based structure with fresh tomato sauce and a cheese base, but is unique because of its spicy flavor. Some of the ingredients included in a Calabrese pizza are thinly sliced hot soppressata, hot capicola, hot peppers, and fresh mozzarella. </p>
<p> Mozzarella di bufala is a dairy product traditionally made from buffalo milk in southern Italy </p>
<p> Campania extensively produces tomatoes, peppers, spring onions, potatoes, artichokes, fennel, lemons, and oranges which all take on the flavor of volcanic soil. The Gulf of Naples offers fish and seafood. Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams, and shellfish.[54] </p>
<p> Spaghetti alla puttanesca is a popular dish made with olives, tomatoes, anchovies, capers, chili peppers, and garlic. The region is well-known also for its mozzarella production (especially from the milk of water buffalo) that's used in a variety of dishes, including parmigiana (shallow fried eggplant slices layered with cheese and tomato sauce, then baked). Desserts include struffoli (deep fried balls of dough), ricotta-based pastiera and sfogliatelle, and rum-dipped babà.[54] </p>
<p> Originating in Neapolitan cuisine, pizza has become popular in many different parts of the world.[55] Pizza is an oven-baked, flat, disc-shaped bread typically topped with a tomato sauce, cheese (usually mozzarella), and various toppings depending on the culture. Since the original pizza, several other types of pizzas have evolved. </p>
<p> Since Naples was the capital of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, its cuisine took much from the culinary traditions of all the Campania region, reaching a balance between dishes based on rural ingredients (pasta, vegetables, cheese) and seafood dishes (fish, crustaceans, mollusks). A vast variety of recipes is influenced by the local aristocratic cuisine, like timballo and the sartù di riso, pasta or rice dishes with very elaborate preparation, while the dishes coming from the popular traditions contain inexpensive but nutritionally healthy ingredients, like pasta with beans and other pasta dishes with vegetables. </p>
<p> Emilia-Romagna is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. The Romagna subregion is renowned for pasta dishes like cappelletti, garganelli, strozzapreti, sfoglia lorda, and tortelli alla lastra as well as cheeses such as squacquerone, Piadina snacks are also a specialty of the subregion. </p>
<p> In the Emilia subregion, except Piacenza which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of Lombardy, rice is eaten to a lesser extent. Polenta, a maize-based dish, is common in both Emilia and Romagna. </p>
<p> Bologna and Modena are notable for pasta dishes like tortellini, lasagne, gramigna, and tagliatelle which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated balsamic vinegar is made only in the Emilian cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, following legally binding traditional procedures.[56] Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena, and Bologna and is often used in cooking. Grana Padano cheese is produced in Piacenza. </p>
<p> Although the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include Parma's prosciutto, culatello, and Felino salami; Piacenza's pancetta, coppa, and salami; Bologna's mortadella and salame rosa; Modena's zampone, cotechino, and cappello del prete; and Ferrara's salama da sugo. Piacenza is also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include zuppa inglese (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and Alchermes liqueur) and panpepato (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). </p>
<p> Focaccia with rosemary. Focaccia is widely associated with Ligurian cuisine </p>
<p> Liguria is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. Savory pies are popular, mixing greens and artichokes along with cheeses, milk curds, and eggs. Onions and olive oil are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use chickpeas in farinata and polenta-like panissa. The former is served plain or topped with onions, artichokes, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.[57] </p>
<p> Hilly districts use chestnuts as a source of carbohydrates. Ligurian pastas include corzetti from the Polcevera valley; pansoti, a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables; piccagge, pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and served with artichoke sauce or pesto sauce; trenette, made from whole wheat flour cut into long strips and served with pesto; boiled beans and potatoes; and trofie, a Ligurian gnocchi made from whole grain flour and boiled potatoes, made into a spiral shape and often tossed in pesto.[57] Many Ligurians emigrated to Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing the cuisine of the country (which was otherwise dominated by meat and dairy products that the narrow Ligurian hinterland would have not allowed). </p>
<p> Pasta dishes based on the use of guanciale (unsmoked bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks) are often found in Lazio, such as pasta alla carbonara and pasta all'amatriciana. Another pasta dish of the region is arrabbiata, with spicy tomato sauce. The regional cuisine widely use offal, resulting in dishes like the entrail-based rigatoni with pajata sauce and coda alla vaccinara.[58] </p>
<p> Iconic of Lazio is cheese made from ewes' milk (Pecorino Romano), porchetta (savory, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast) and Frascati white wine. The influence of the ancient Jewish community can be noticed in the Roman cuisine's traditional carciofi alla giudia.[58] </p>
<p> The regional cuisine of Lombardy is heavily based upon ingredients like maize, rice, beef, pork, butter, and lard. Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as risotto. The best-known version is risotto alla milanese, flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as ossobuco alla milanese (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and cotoletta alla milanese (a fried cutlet similar to Wiener schnitzel, but cooked "bone-in").[59] </p>
<p> Other regional specialities include cassoeula (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), Cremona's Mostarda (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), Valtellina's bresaola (air-dried salted beef) and pizzoccheri (a flat ribbon pasta made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes, and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese), and Mantua's tortelli di zucca (ravioli with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.[59] </p>
<p> Regional cheeses include Robiola, Crescenza, Taleggio, Gorgonzola, and Grana Padano (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle farming). Polenta is common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous panettone Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked). </p>
<p> On the coast of Marche, fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and hams. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. Suckling pig, chicken, and fish are often stuffed with rosemary or fennel fronds and garlic before being roasted or placed on the spit.[60] </p>
<p> Ascoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for olive all'ascolana, (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg, and Parmesan, then fried).[61] Another well-known Marche product are the Maccheroncini di Campofilone, from little town of Campofilone, a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in one's mouth. </p>
<p> Between the Alps and the Po valley, featuring a large number of different ecosystems, the Piedmont region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. As a point of union between traditional Italian and French cuisine, Piedmont is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses with protected geographical status and wines under DOC. It is also the region where both the Slow Food association and the most prestigious school of Italian cooking, the University of Gastronomic Sciences, were founded.[62] </p>
<p> Castelmagno is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its Carrù beef (particularly bue grasso, "fat ox"), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon, and salt; carpaccio; Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef; and boiled beef served with various sauces.[62] </p>
<p> The food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are the traditional agnolotti (pasta folded over with roast beef and vegetable stuffing), paniscia (a typical dish of Novara, a kind of risotto with Arborio rice or Maratelli rice, the typical kind of Saluggia beans, onion, Barbera wine, lard, salami, season vegetables, salt and pepper), taglierini (thinner version of tagliatelle), bagna cauda (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil, and butter), and bicerin (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate, and whole milk). Piedmont is one of the Italian capitals of pastry and chocolate in particular, with products like Nutella, gianduiotto, and marron glacé that are famous worldwide.[62] </p>
<p> An exhibition of typical Sardinian pasta shapes, cakes, and pastries </p>
<p> Suckling pig and wild boar are roasted on the spit or boiled in stews of beans and vegetables, thickened with bread. Herbs such as mint and myrtle are widely used in the regional cuisine. Sardinia also has many special types of bread, made dry, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads.[63] </p>
<p> Also baked are carasau bread civraxu, coccoi a pitzus, a highly decorative bread, and pistocu made with flour and water only, originally meant for herders, but often served at home with tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic, and a strong cheese. Rock lobster, scampi, squid, tuna, and sardines are the predominant seafoods.[63] </p>
<p> Casu marzu is a very strong cheese produced in Sardinia, but is of questionable legality due to hygiene concerns.[64] </p>
<p> Sicily shows traces of all the cultures which established themselves on the island over the last two millennia. Although its cuisine undoubtedly has a predominantly Italian base, Sicilian food also has Spanish, Greek and Arab influences. Dionysus is said to have introduced wine to the region: a trace of historical influence from Ancient Greece.[65] </p>
<p> Pasta alla Norma is amongst Sicily's most historic and iconic dishes </p>
<p> The ancient Romans introduced lavish dishes based on goose. The Byzantines favored sweet and sour flavors and the Arabs brought sugar, citrus, rice, spinach, and saffron. The Normans and Hohenstaufens had a fondness for meat dishes. The Spanish introduced items from the New World including chocolate, maize, turkey, and tomatoes.[65] </p>
<p> Much of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as eggplant, peppers, and tomatoes, as well as fish such as tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, and swordfish. In Trapani, in the extreme western corner of the island, North African influences are clear in the use of various couscous based dishes, usually combined with fish.[66] Mint is used extensively in cooking unlike the rest of Italy. </p>
<p> Before the Council of Trent in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian Habsburg Empire came in.[70] </p>
<p> Simplicity is central to the Tuscan cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms, and fresh fruit are used. A good example of typical Tuscan food is ribollita, a notable soup whose name literally means "reboiled". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins. Ribollita was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover minestrone or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans, and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, silverbeet, cavolo nero (Tuscan kale), onion, and olive oil. </p>
<p> A regional Tuscan pasta known as pici resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White truffles from San Miniato appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional Florentine steak, come from the Chianina cattle breed of the Chiana Valley and the Maremmana from Maremma. </p>
<p> In the Aosta Valley, bread-thickened soups are customary as well as cheese fondue, chestnuts, potatoes, rice. Polenta is a staple along with rye bread, smoked bacon, Motsetta (cured chamois meat), and game from the mountains and forests. Butter and cream are important in stewed, roasted, and braised dishes.[74] Typical regional products include Fontina cheese, Vallée d'Aoste Lard d'Arnad, red wines and Génépi Artemisia-based liqueur.[75] </p>
<p> Venice and many surrounding parts of Veneto are known for risotto, a dish whose ingredients can highly vary upon different areas. Fish and seafood are added in regions closer to the coast while pumpkin, asparagus, radicchio, and frog legs appear farther away from the Adriatic Sea. </p>
<p> Made from finely ground maize meal, polenta is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of Northern Italy. It may be included in stirred dishes and baked dishes. Polenta can be served with various cheese, stockfish, or meat dishes. Some polenta dishes include porcini, rapini, or other vegetables or meats, such as small song-birds in the case of the Venetian and Lombard dish polenta e osei, or sausages. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named biancoperla, so that the color of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called polenta bianca). </p>
<p> Beans, peas, and other legumes are seen in these areas with pasta e fagioli (beans and pasta) and risi e bisi (rice and peas). Venice features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as stockfish or simple marinated anchovies are found here as well. </p>
<p> Squid and cuttlefish are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called nero di seppia.[76][77] Regional desserts include tiramisu (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks and mascarpone, and flavored with liquor and cocoa[78]), baicoli (biscuits made with butter and vanilla), and nougat. </p>
<p> A typical Italian breakfast, consisting of cappuccino and brioche / croissant / cornetto. </p>
<p> Traditional meals in Italy typically contained four or five courses.[79] Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures. During holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Eve, feasts can last for hours.[80] </p>
<p> Today, full-course meals are mainly reserved for special events such as weddings, while everyday meals include only a first or second course (sometimes both), a side dish, and coffee. The primo (first course) is usually a filling dish such as risotto or pasta, with sauces made from meat, vegetables, or seafood. Whole pieces of meat such as sausages, meatballs, poultry are eaten in the secondo. Italian cuisine has some single-course meals (piatto unico) combining starches and proteins. Contorni of vegetables and starches are served on a separate plate and not on the plate with the meat as is done in northern European Style serving. </p>
<p> A bottle of sparkling Prosecco, which one would have as an aperitivo </p>
<p> literally "before (the) meal", hot or cold, usually consist of cheese, ham, sliced sausage, marinated vegetables or fish, bruschetta and bread appetizers. </p>
<p> Primo </p>
<p> "first course", usually consists of a hot dish like pasta, risotto, gnocchi, or soup with a sauce, vegetarian, meat or fish sugo or ragù as a sauce </p>
<p> Secondo </p>
<p> "second course", the main dish, usually fish or meat with potatoes. Traditionally veal, pork, and chicken are most commonly used, at least in the North, though beef has become more popular since World War II and wild game is found, particularly in Tuscany. Fish is also very popular, especially in the south. </p>
<p> Contorno </p>
<p> "side dish", may be a salad or cooked vegetables. A traditional menu features salad along with the main course. </p>
<p> Formaggio e frutta </p>
<p> "cheese and fruits", the first dessert. Local cheeses may be part of the antipasto or contorno as well. </p>
<p> Dolce </p>
<p> "sweet", such as cakes (like Tiramisu), cookies or ice-cream </p>
<p> Each type of establishment has a defined role and traditionally sticks to it.[81] </p>
<p> Working farms that offer accommodations and meals. Sometimes meals are served to guests only. According to Italian law, they can only serve local-made products (except drinks). Marked by a green and gold sign with a knife and fork.[82] </p>
<p> Locations which serve coffee, soft drinks, juice and alcohol. Hours are generally from 6am to 10pm. Foods may include croissants and other sweet breads (often called 'brioche' in Northern Italy), panini, tramezzini (sandwiches) and spuntini (snacks such as olives, potato crisps and small pieces of frittata).[82] </p>
<p> Birreria </p>
<p> A bar that offers beer; found in central and northern regions of Italy.[82] </p>
<p> Bruschetteria </p>
<p> Specialises in bruschetta, though other dishes may also be offered. </p>
<p> Frasca/Locanda </p>
<p> Friulian wine producers that open for the evening and may offer food along with their wines.[82] </p>
<p> An Italian ice cream shop/bar that sells gelato. A shop where the customer can get his or her gelato to go, or sit down and eat it in a cup or a cone. Bigger ice desserts, coffee, or liquors may also be ordered. </p>
<p> Focused on simple food of the region, often having no written menu. Many are open only at night but some open for lunch.[83] The name has become fashionable for upscale restaurants with a rustic regional style. </p>
<p> Often offers upscale cuisine and printed menus.[84] </p>
<p> Rosticceria </p>
<p> Fast food restaurant, offering local dishes like cotoletta alla milanese, roasted meat (usually pork or chicken), supplì and arancini even as take-away. </p>
<p> Spaghetteria </p>
<p> Originating in Naples, offering pasta dishes and other main courses.[86] </p>
<p> Tavola Calda </p>
<p> Literally "hot table", offers pre-made regional dishes. Most open at 11am and close late.[87] </p>
<p> A dining establishment, often family run, with inexpensive prices and an informal atmosphere.[88] </p>
<p> Italian style coffee (caffè), also known as espresso, is made from a blend of coffee beans. Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as one moves south. </p>
<p> A common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern espresso machine, invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to 90 to 95 °C (194 to 203 °F) and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25–30 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 fl oz, two tablespoons) of liquid.[89] </p>
<p> Home coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. La Napoletana is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The Moka per il caffè is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.[90] </p>
<p> Espresso is usually served in a demitasse cup. Caffè macchiato is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; ristretto is made with less water, and is stronger; cappuccino is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; caffelatte is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to café au lait, and is typically served in a large cup. Latte macchiato (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and caffè corretto is "corrected" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as grappa or brandy. </p>
<p> The bicerin is also an Italian coffee, from Turin. It is a mixture of cappuccino and traditional hot chocolate, as it consists of a mix of coffee and drinking chocolate, and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top. </p>
<p> Italy produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the New World.[91] There are twenty separate wine regions.[92] </p>
<p> Those vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with Italian wine. To promote this, the Italian government passed the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method, and type of grape. The designation Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.[93] </p>
<p> In Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it is extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic, or otherwise. </p>
<p> Italy hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually pale lager. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing as beer becomes increasingly popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighboring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are Peroni and Moretti. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and South Tyrol (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most. </p>
<p> There are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. Limoncello, a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy (Sorrento, Amalfi and the Gulf of Naples) is the second most popular liqueur in Italy after Campari.[94] Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, served chilled in small glasses or cups.[94] </p>
<p> Amaro Sicilianos are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. Mirto, an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in Sardinia and other regions. Another well-known digestif is Amaro Lucano from Basilicata.[95] </p>
<p> Grappa is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the Alps and of the Po Valley. The most famous grappas are distilled in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Piedmont, and Trentino. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are Martini, Vermouth, and Campari. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for French champagne is prosecco, from the Veneto region.[96][97] </p>
<p> From the Italian perspective, cookies and candy belong to the same category of sweets.[98] Traditional candies include candied fruits, torrone, and nut brittles, all of which are still popular in the modern era. In medieval times, northern Italy became so famous for the quality of its stiff fruit pastes (similar to marmalade or conserves, except stiff enough to mold into shapes) that "Paste of Genoa" became a generic name for high-quality fruit conserves.[99] </p>
<p> Silver-coated almond dragées, which are called confetti, are thrown at weddings. The idea of including a romantic note with candy may have begun with Italian dragées, no later than the early 19th century, and is carried on with the multilingual love notes included in boxes of Italy's most famous chocolate, Baci by Perugina in Milan.[100] The most significant chocolate style is a combination of hazelnuts and milk chocolate, which is featured in gianduja pastes like Nutella, which is made by Ferrero SpA in Alba, Piedmont, as well as Perugnia's Baci and many other chocolate confections.[98] </p>
<p> Panettone is a traditional Christmas cake </p>
<p> Gelato is Italian ice cream </p>
<p> Panna Cotta with garnish </p>
<p> Tiramisu with cocoa powder garnish </p>
<p> Cannoli with pistachio, candied fruit, and chocolate chips </p>
<p> Every region has its own holiday recipes. During La Festa di San Giuseppe (St. Joseph's Day) on 19 March, Sicilians give thanks to St. Joseph for preventing a famine during the Middle Ages.[101][102] The fava bean saved the population from starvation, and is a traditional part of St. Joseph's Day altars and traditions.[103] Other customs celebrating this festival include wearing red clothing, eating Sicilian pastries known as zeppole and giving food to the poor. </p>
<p> On Easter Sunday, lamb is served throughout Italy. A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, boiled eggs, wine, Easter Cakes, and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the Colomba Pasquale (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as "Italian Easter cake" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with almonds and pearl sugar. </p>
<p> On Christmas Eve a symbolic fast is observed with the cena di magro ("light dinner"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are panettone and pandoro. </p>
<p> Due to several Italian colonies established in Africa, mainly in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya, and Somalia (except the northern part, which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations. </p>
<p> Italy's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of pasta on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs. </p>
<p> All major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of Italians. There are "Italian Clubs" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in South Africa, especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards. </p>
<p> In France, the cuisine of Corsica has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the Early Middle Ages until 1768 first of a Pisan and then a Genoese possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the charcuterie. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine has had a strong influence on Slovenian cuisine. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the Slovenian Littoral and part of Inner Carniola) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous Italian minority live in Slovenian Istria. </p>
<p> Dishes that are shared between Slovenian cuisine and the cuisine Italian Friuli Venezia Giulia include the gubana nut roll of Friuli (known as guban'ca or potica in Slovenia) and the jota stew. </p>
<p> An Italian-American pizza with pepperoni (salami), mushrooms, olives and peppers </p>
<p> Much of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily Americanized to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most pizza eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity. </p>
<p> Throughout the country the "torta de milanesa" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a breaded, pan-fried cutlet of pork or beef. "Pescado Veracruzano" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, "espagueti" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups. </p>
<p> "Milanesa a la napolitana" with French fries, an Italian-inspired dish based on the original cotoletta dish from Milan, common in South America. This dish is called "parmegiana steak" in Brazil, though it is not typical from Parma region in Italy but was actually invented in Buenos Aires. </p>
<p> Due to large Italian immigration to Argentina, Italian food and drink is heavily featured in Argentine cuisine. An example could be milanesas (The name comes from the original cotoletta alla milanese from Milan, Italy) or breaded cutlets. Pizza (locally pronounced pisa or pitsa), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian calzones than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as Sorrentinos and Argentine gnocchi. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the huge Italian community, São Paulo is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including milanesa steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of pizza, different from both Neapolitan and American varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In Rio de Janeiro Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical botequim counter snack. </p>
<p> There is considerable Italian influence in Venezuelan cuisine. Pan chabata, or Venezuelan ciabatta, Pan Siciliano, Sicilian bread, Cannoli siciliani, Sicilian cannoli, and the drink chinotto are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages. </p>

<p> A Typical Italian Easter Dinner </p>
<p> Author of "The Better-Than-Takeout Thai Cookbook," Danette St. Onge is a food and travel writer with expertise in a variety of cuisines including Italian. </p>
<p> Traditionally, Easter (Pasqua in Italian) marks the end of the long, lean period of privation during Lent, a time when foods such as meat, eggs, butter, and lard were not eaten. And so the holiday was an occasion for an abundant and indulgent feast—though, really, what Italian holiday isn't? </p>
<p> Even though Lent is no longer as strictly observed as it once was, Easter is still time for celebration, especially at the table. A popular Italian expression, "Natale con i tuoi, Pasqua con chi vuoi," means "Christmas with your parents, Easter with whomever you want." In other words, it's traditional to spend Christmas (Natale) with family, but Easter (though it probably still involves family, as most Italian holidays do), is a bit looser, and you're free to celebrate it with your friends. But no matter who joins you at your table, there will most likely be certain dishes presented at an Italian Easter meal. </p>
<p> Soup </p>
<p> A traditional Italian Easter meal might start off with a soup, such as the Naples classic that has become popular throughout the world, Italian wedding soup. Originally a peasant dish, made by using whatever meat and greens were leftover, this quintessential Italian soup has become ubiquitous with holiday and celebratory meals. The name, minestra maritata, means "married soup," referring to the flavors blending together. However, the English translation turned it into Italian wedding soup, giving the impression the dish is saved for matrimonial celebrations. </p>
<p> Egg Dishes </p>
<p> Eggs—both dyed and cooked—are an important part of the Italian Easter celebration as they are a symbol of renewal and rebirth. You will find them in dishes such as a torta pasqualina, an Easter pie made of eggs, ricotta, and chard that is popular in Liguria, as well as a brodetto pasquale, which is similar to a frittata. This dish from the Basilicata region incorporates eggs with lamb and asparagus, although the original recipe uses wild cardoons, a vegetable that can be hard to find. </p>
<p> Lamb </p>
<p> Another symbol of spring is the lamb, and you will find this type of meat on many an Italian Easter table. It may be in the form of agnello atta scottadito, Italian grilled lamb chops with juniper berries, or you may be served braised lamb shanks, Italian-style. </p>
<p> Vegetables </p>
<p> In true Italian style, cooks will create vegetable dishes using whatever is fresh at the market or in the garden. And, seeing that Easter signals the beginning of spring, the selection will most likely be, to name a few, artichokes, asparagus, and a type of chicory called ciccoria, which may be hard to find in the U.S. Stuffed artichokes are a favorite way to prepare this vegetable, either with garlic-cheese breadcrumbs or with a meat stuffing. </p>
<p> Bread </p>
<p> Southern Italians make many types of elaborate savory Easter breads which often incorporate meats, cheeses, and whole eggs in their shell. The casatiello from Naples is one such bread, baked into a ring topped with whole eggs. The casatiello of the Liguria region was traditionally made with 33 thin layers of dough, one for each year of Jesus's life. </p>
<p> A simple, braided bread is also traditional at Italian Easter meals. Scented with anise and lemon, it definitely has a characteristic Italian flavor. There are many sweet Easter breads, as well, the most widespread being the colomba, a dove-shaped sweet yeast bread topped with slivered almonds and crunchy pearl sugar, rather similar in texture and flavor to the classic Italian Christmas cake, panettone. The colomba originated in the Lombardy region but is now popular throughout Italy and in Italian communities abroad. </p>
<p> Sweets and Desserts </p>
<p> A well-known Easter dessert is the pastiera Napoletana, so popular that now it is eaten year-round. It's creamy ricotta and semolina cake flavored with lemon zest and orange-blossom water, and traditionally made with wheat berries (symbolizing fertility) and candied orange peel. This version is lighter, faster (the traditional version takes several days to make), and crust-free, and has raisins instead of wheat berries. </p>
<p> Another classic ending to the Italian holiday meal is a Florentine Easter cake or schiacciata. It is tinged with orange flavor from the fresh juice and zest, and can be filled with pastry cream or whipped cream, as well as enjoyed simply as is dusted with confectioner's sugar. </p>
<p> And for the children, the most popular Easter treat is hollow chocolate eggs containing toy surprises. </p>

<p> Just For You! 5 Classic Recipes with a Deliciously Secret Twist </p>
<p> Italian Green Beans </p>
<p> This post may contain affiliate links which won’t change your price but will share some commission. </p>
<p> The simplest, most delicious side dish recipe and the best way to eat green beans! These Italian Green Beans are sauteed in butter, bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. </p>
<p> Italian Green Beans Recipe </p>
<p> The traditional veggie casserole on the dinner table at many family gatherings is Green Bean Casserole. It definitely is a hit in our family. But these Italian Green Beans? They’re something else. Matt isn’t usually jumping with excitement if I serve green beans for dinner. But he loves these Italian Green Beans sauteed in buttery parmesan. When I serve these green beans is one of the only times that we fight over who gets the last little bit of green beans in the bowl. </p>
<p> Are green beans good for you? </p>
<p> Yes! Green beans are a great option for a side dish because they are low calories, packed full of Vitamin C and K, fiber and folate. </p>
<p> What are the differences between frozen and canned vegetables? </p>
<p> Green beans are normally picked and processed (either frozen or canned) at their peak of freshness, usually within a few hours of processing. This means they are both packed full of nutrients and vitamins. The canning process takes longer than freezing, but both are great options if you can’t choose fresh garden veggies. One thing to remember if you choose canned…often times the vegetables will be packed with added sodium or sugars. If you choose canned, be sure to read the labels to know exactly what you are buying. </p>
<p> Can I use canned green beans in this recipe? </p>
<p> As you’ll see, this recipe calls for frozen green beans. But we often get asked “Can I use canned green beans?”. Canned green beans may fall apart a little bit because they are “softer” than frozen green beans. Because of that reason (and that frozen veggies have a prettier color) we recommend frozen for this recipe. </p>
<p> How to Cook Green Beans </p>
<p> As you can read in the recipe below, we use a Ziploc Zip ‘n Steam bag to steam our green beans. We find this is the quickest and easiest no-fail method. You can also steam green beans in the Instant Pot, microwave or stovetop. </p>
<p> Easy Green Bean Recipe </p>
<p> Here are a few hints for making green beans: </p>
<p> We love to use freshly grated parmesan cheese. It really adds to the flavor and texture of this recipe. The freshly grated cheese will melt a little better than pre-packaged Parmesan. </p>
<p> You may use store-bought bread crumbs if you’d like, but I usually like to crumble my own bread. We always have spare hot dog or hamburger buns in our freezer. Crumbling one or two up for homemade bread crumbs is a great way to use those random buns. </p>
<p> Saute the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in the butter for 3-4 minutes until they are well coated and starting to brown a bit. </p>
<p> While the bread crumbs are sauteing in the frying pan, you can prepare your green beans. You’ll need a 1 pound bag of frozen green beans. I love using Ziploc Zip’N Steam Cooking Bags bags to steam our veggies. You can use the bags more than one time and you get perfectly steamed veggies in just minutes. You can also cook the green beans in a pot of water if you’d like. </p>
<p> Once the green beans are cooked, add them to the frying pan and mix until they are coated with that buttery, garlicky, cheesy mixture. </p>
<p> What to serve with green beans? </p>
<p> Although these green beans are called “Italian” Green Beans, they are versatile and can be served as a side to just about any dinner. Their flavor is so savory and your family will love them! </p>

<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, Italian seasoning, bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Stir to coat and saute over medium heat until the bread crumbs start to brown, about 3-4 minutes. </p>
<p> While the bread crumbs are sauteing, cook the green beans, either in a Ziploc Zip 'n Steam bag (according to package directions) or in a pot of water. </p>
<p> Add the green beans to the frying pan and stir to coat. </p>

<p> Comments </p>
<p> Looks delicious..I will be definitely making this for my Christmas dinner as a side dish…Thanks for the recipe..:) </p>
<p> Those look amazing! I would love these rather than the standard green bean casserole at Thanksgiving. Love the bright green color. </p>
<p> Oh yum! These green beans look so delicious and crunchy. I wanna take a big bite of these babies. </p>
<p> These look so fresh and light! Thanksgiving foods can get so heavy, but I love the look of this recipe! </p>
<p> My 5 yr old LOVES green beans – he will be thrilled to have a new way to eat them! 🙂 </p>
<p> I was wondering if you thaw the bag of frozen green beans or add them to the butter frozen? </p>
<p> OMG ignore my comment! I just read through all of the instructions! Cannot wait to try, looks delicious! </p>
<p> Crystal, You should cook the green beans first. Either steam them in the microwave, or cook them in a pan of water until they are tender. We like to steamp them in Ziploc Zip ‘n Steam microwave bags. </p>
<p> I made them with fresh organic green beans.. and made the following changes… I left our the bread crumbs to make more low carb cooked in olive oil instead of butter seemed more Italian… increased the cheese and garlic and instead of Italian Seasoning and Red Pepper flakes used a spaghetti seasoning that includes these ingredients from an Italian store. Everyone went for those very well and enjoyed them at an Italian wine dinner. I will make these again. </p>
<p> Think next time I may add mushrooms would have this time but ran out of time.. but they really gave me a good idea and had i not seen this recipe wouldn’t have been done green beans for the dinner party and they were a big hit and needed. </p>
<p> Are the breadcrumbs already toasted when you put them in the butter mixture or do you use fresh breadcrumbs and then they toast as they cook in the butter </p>
<p> I used dried breadcrumbs that come in the container. If you are using fresh, I’d toast them. 🙂 </p>
<p> The bread crumbs would be a little soggy if you did this. I prefer it made right before we eat it. </p>
<p> I had some fresh green beans that I needed to use up and wanted to try something different. This recipe turned out delicious! Thank you! </p>
<p> Could I use canned green beans. That’s what I have. Not wanting to go to the store w all my kids. </p>

<p> The Only Italian Lasagna Recipe You’ll Ever Need </p>
<p> A properly-made lasagna is a dish of consummate beauty and one of the most beloved Italian food dishes in the world. But there is a big difference between authentic lasagna and the frozen stuff you buy at the store. That’s why we went to our resident Italian home cooking expert, Loredana, for a recipe. Her recipe for real Italian pizza is one of the most popular blogs on walksofitaly.com so we trust you’ll find this recipe just as useful. Any questions or comments – don’t hesitate to let us know in the comments section. </p>
<p> Before we get started… </p>
<p> A note on the origins of Italian lasagna and the use of dried pasta: </p>
<p> Lasagna has many versions, both within Italy and around the world, but when we talk about “real” lasagna in Italy we mean “Lasagna alla Bolognese” i.e., from Bologna in the region of Emilia-Romagna. One of the traditional pasta shapes of this region is the long, flat strips that go into making the layers of lasagna. Although some Italians will buy these strips dried, it’s still quite common in Emilia-Romagna to make them at home, along with other regional specialties like tortellini. </p>
<p> Fresh sheets of egg pasta always taste better in lasagna than dried ones. Here in Italy we are lucky enough to even be able to buy high-quality, handmade pasta sheets fresh from the Pastificio or pasta shop. They are inexpensive and readily available, but this is rarely the case outside of Italy. If you can’t get fresh pasta, don’t worry: making pasta from scratch is really easy, and once you get the hang of it, you’ll find you can create fresh pasta quite quickly. If you simply don’t have the inclination or the time, dried pasta is also acceptable – just be aware that you are sacrificing taste and texture for convenience. Don’t worry, though: your secret is safe with us. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> – 1 white onion </p>
<p> – 1 small stalk of celery </p>
<p> – 250 grams of passata (passata is pureed tomatoes which usually come in a bottle. A can of crushed tomatoes will also work) </p>
<p> – 350 grams (approximately 3/4 lb) ground pork </p>
<p> – ½ glass of white wine </p>
<p> – salt </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: One of the main “secrets” of Italian cooking is that it prioritizes high quality, seasonal ingredients. Making a ragu is relatively easy but the taste will improve or worsen depending on the quality of your meat, vegetables, and passata. If you want to learn more, check out our comprehensive guide to eating seasonally in Italy. </p>
<p> …And for the bechamel </p>
<p> – 1 liter (1 quart) of milk </p>
<p> – 100 grams (7 tablespoons or a little less than 1/2 cup) of butter </p>
<p> – 80 grams (2/3 cup) all-purpose flour </p>
<p> – A tiny pinch of Nutmeg </p>
<p> – A pinch of salt </p>
<p> – A pinch of ground pepper </p>
<p> * In Italy, “0”, or “zero,” flour is a refined, white flour used for making pasta. It’s not as refined as “00” or “doppio zero” flour, but typically more refined than the white flour that is often found on store shelves outside of Italy. If you can’t get your hands on any 0 flour, your all-purpose white flour will work fine, but the consistency will be slightly different. Purists might turn their noses up, but we have no problem using the regular stuff if we have run out of “0”. </p>
<p> 1. Make your pasta sheets </p>
<p> Place almost all of the flour on your cutting board (reserve 50 grams or so, a little more than 1/3 a cup) – wood is the best material to knead on, but plastic boards or even just your countertop are okay, too – and make a hollow in the center of our little pile so it looks like a flour volcano. </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: Making pasta dough in a drafty room can cause it to dry out. try to choose a cool, dry, but not-drafty spot for your pasta making. </p>
<p> Break the eggs into the “crater” of the volcano, and stir them with a fork so that the yolks and whites mix before you begin to incorporate them into your flour. </p>

<p> Start to incorporate the eggs and flour by slowly bringing more flour in from the inside edges of the “crater”. Continue mixing the flour with the eggs until the mixture comes together. </p>
<p> Knead everything together for 10 minutes pushing it down with the heel of your hand, turning, stretching, folding, then smashing it down again. Kneading is necessary to work the gluten in the dough and make it more elastic. </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: If you find the dough too hard, add a spoonful of warm water. If it’s a little sticky, add some of the flour you left aside at the beginning. Do not add any more flour than what you have reserved specifically for this purpose. </p>
<p> Wrap the prepared dough in plastic wrap, and put it aside – in a dry place – to let it rest for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. This step is particularly important if you are rolling your pasta by hand because it is necessary to relax the gluten in the dough. If you don’t let the gluten relax and try to roll it with a rolling pin you had better hope you have forearms like an Italian nonna (i.e., corded with thick muscles) because you’re going to have a hard time. However, if you have a pasta maker you don’t necessarily need to relax the dough, just be aware that the final product will be a bit stiffer. </p>
<p> Sprinkle a little flour on your cutting board. Unwrap your dough, and push it down a little with the palm of the hand. At this point, you have two options: the rolling pin OR a pasta machine! </p>
<p> If you opt for the rolling pin, sprinkle just a little bit of flour on the dough and start rolling the pin back and forth using light pressure until it reaches a thickness of 0.5mm. </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: After about a minute a minute of rolling , roll the far edge of the dough around the pin, hold the opposite edge with your hand and roll the pin towards yourself. Then roll it back in order to “unfold” it. Once unfolded, rotate the dough 90° to the right and repeat. </p>
<p> If you have a pasta-making machine, cut the dough into quarters or (eighths, depending on the size of the machine) then flatten a quarter of the dough and sprinkle it with flour before feeding it into the machine. Begin with the highest thickness option – i.e, the widest setting. When you have rolled out one strip, fold it in half and pass it through again. Continue by reducing the width of the rolling slot, until you reach a thickness of approximately 0.5mm. Also remember that every time you make the width of the rolling slot shorter, you have to pass the dough through it twice, folding it in half for the second pass. </p>
<p> Chef’s Trick: Cover the strips you have just made with plastic wrap so you can stack new strips on top of them without sticking. </p>
<p> Cut the big sheet of pasta or the strips of pasta into rectangles of about 20 cm x 14 cm (8 inches x 5 inches)and cook them in boiling water for 30 seconds. Dry them and set aside on clean kitchen towels. </p>
<p> 2. Make your Ragù </p>
<p> Ragu – the longer you let it simmer, the better it gets | Photo by Simon Law via Flickr. </p>
<p> Heat a healthy glug of olive oil in a large pan or dutch oven while you peel the carrot and the onion. Wash and dry the celery. Cut the three of them into tiny pieces. and cook them over a low heat until they are soft (roughly 5 minutes). </p>
<p> Turn the heat to medium-high and add the ground beef and ground pork. When the meat has browned and the liquid it releases has evaporated, add the white wine and stir. When the wine has evaporated, add the passata, salt, and pepper. Stir again to mix the ingredients and let them cook on a low heat for at least an hour. </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: The longer a ragù cooks, the tastier it becomes. Our grandmothers would stew theirs literally all day – 12 hours or more. If you want to put this much time into your sauce remember to keep the heat as low as you can (and still have the occasional small bubble rising to the surface) and to stir from time to time. Tasting it is the best way to decide if the ragù is ready! </p>
<p> 3. Put the ragù aside and get ready to make your bechamel, or as we say in Italy, “Besciamella” sauce. </p>
<p> Warm the milk in a saucepan, but don’t let it boil. </p>
<p> In a separate saucepan, cube the butter and melt it over low heat. As soon as it has liquefied take it off the heat and gradually whisk in the flour, making sure that no lumps form. </p>
<p> Place the pan with the butter and flour mixture back on a low heat and add your warm milk, salt, nutmeg and ground pepper. Stir rapidly with the whisk until it thickens and becomes smooth. </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: When making a bechamel sauce, don’t stop stirring until you have added and incorporated all of your ingredients – this will help you to keep lumps from forming </p>
<p> 4. Time to put your lasagna layers together! </p>
<p> Bechamel, ragu, and pasta (with a sprinkle of cheese, if you like it extra cheesy). Pretty simple. | Photo by Rebecca Siegel </p>
<p> Pour a fine layer of besciamella on the bottom of your casserole dish. </p>
<p> Cover it with a layer of ragu. </p>
<p> Place your pasta rectangles side-by-side on top of the ragu until you have covered it completely. Don’t allow them to overlap too much – you don’t want any double layers of pasta. </p>
<p> Repeat the process in the same order as above until you reach 5 or 6 layers of pasta. On the very last layer of pasta place a slightly thicker layer of bechamel and ragù as it is the layer most exposed to the hot air of the oven and tends to dry up a little. Sprinkle some parmesan cheese on top, or between the layers if you like, but this is not a requirement. </p>
<p> Chef’s Tip: In order to ensure that a lasagna holds its shape after it is cut and plated, many Italians alternate the orientation of their pasta with each layer. So if you lay your first layer of pasta lengthwise, you will lay your second layer crosswise, alternating each time. Although this may seem pointless, it’s one of those nonna secrets and we swear by it. </p>
<p> 5. Bake! </p>
<p> Place the casserole in a pre-heated oven at 200° Celcius (390 Fahrenheit) for about 25 minutes. You will know the lasagna is ready when you can see a golden crust around the outside edges on the top layer. </p>
<p> Let your gorgeous lasagna rest for a couple of minutes before cutting and serving. Enjoy! </p>

<p> Sorry about that, Dan. We wrote it in Celcius without thinking. That’s roughly 400 degrees Fahrenheit. We fixed it in the text to clarify. Thanks for pointing that out! </p>
<p> great article! why not write traditional recipes of Apulian cuisine? you can take a cue from my website Apulia Destination. </p>
<p> What a wonderful looking blog and recipe. My son spent some time in Italy and came back cooking Italian dishes, which I love. I do have a quick comment about the third paragraph, last sentence: “you’re secret is safe with us” you may want to change the you’re (contraction for you are) to your for correct usage. </p>
<p> Thank you for the nice comment and thank you for pointing that out to us! We have many experts here but the copy editing must have slipped through the cracks – we’re on it! </p>
<p> It makes a 20cm x 30cm casserole dish of lasagna, so one lasagna (the average size). If this is the only meal, we’d say four people with abundant portions. If there are other treats and eats we’d say it can easily serve 6 people. </p>
<p> Yes absolutely! We suggest not cooking it and allowing it to unthaw completely before cooking it. </p>
<p> Just read your ragu recipe does not have the good flavors that Rosa put in her sauce. she was out baby sitter and maid for three years we lived in Naples. FRESH Basil. Oregano, Rosemary, Garlic, Italian seasoning The Herbs were harvested from the pots on the patio so they were FRESH. THREE Days of low simmer cooking. Build the Lasagna bake and enjoy </p>
<p> Traditional bolognese does not have garlic or herbs or even a lot of tomato though often there is milk. It is primarily a meat sauce and too many other flavours hide that. Rosa was making a different sauce though i am sure it tasted great. </p>
<p> Great recipe! I used it more as a guide and incorporated my own ingredients and spices into the Ragu Sauce and Pasta Dough. The Bechamel sauce is really good and did not change that at all. Thank you for sharing! I even made a canine version (subsituted the Ragu Sauce for a “dog-friendly” version). 🙂 </p>
<p> Sorry to disappoint you but we do not use passata to make the sauce, we use tomato paste and we make the “true” lasagne in a different way, similar but not really as you explained. I come from Modena and we make lasagne e tortellini since the dark ages. 😛 </p>
<p> Am I missing something? This lasagna doesn’t have cheese other than a sprinkle of Parmesan? </p>
<p> The lasagna is made with copious amounts of Besciamella sauce (bechamel) which is essentially a heavy cream. It melts and fuses the noodles together and takes the place of the cheese. Also, we recommend a ton of Parmesan, not a sprinkle, but of course that’s all about taste! Buon appetito </p>
<p> We just returned from Italy and had lasagna in Rome that was amazing. I grew up I. An Italian house and thought I had good lasagna all those years. I couldn’t understand what exactly was different with what I had in Rome, but it must have been the bechamel sauce. So creamy and melted cheese li!e. It was delicious. Can’t wait to try this recipe! </p>
<p> It looks absolutely delicious, I’m looking forward to making it. Thanks for the recipe. </p>
<p> I was lucky enough to have fresh-made Lasagne when in Bologna in 2014. I’ve never forgotten that luscious meal. This is the closest thing I have found. Excellent recipe, and I add Parmesan between layers. My family raved for days. </p>
<p> I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago for my family. My daughter asked if I could make it once a week from now on. I have made many lasagnas over the years. This is truly the best one I have ever made….and so simple. Thanks for this fabulous recipe! </p>
<p> This says 250 grams of passata sauce. How many cups is this? I tried converting online and am getting about 1-1/2 cups. This doesn’t sound like enough liquid for 2 pounds of meat. Can you help? I’d really like to try this recipe. </p>
<p> True Italian ragù actually has very little tomato sauce in it – Italians prefer to let the quality meat, fat and spices take center stage. The lasagna isn’t dry thanks to the bechamel sauce put between each noodle! </p>
<p> The pasta making portion of this recipe and ragu sound remarkable like Marcella Hazan in other words authentic. Add the Atlas 150mm or 180mm pasta press and good eats. </p>
<p> I think any quality ragu with complex flavors should have minced, sautéed Mushrooms and more crushed tomatoes… simmer for 6 hours with a cup of Minced carrots and two cups of minced onions…. have had people say they could cry because it was better than when in italy </p>
<p> Sorry, this is not a true mainland Italian sauce. You lost me at ground beef. The meat should be something with bone; slow cooked in the sauce. Pork ribs, lamb shanks etc. </p>
<p> No basil, no oregano, no garlic, no ricotta? I am skeptical. Carrots and celery just don’t seem to do it in a lasagne, but I’m tempted to give it a shot just to see how it comes out. </p>
<p> Classic Italian lasagna is very simple: just a simple soffritto made of diced carrots, celery and onion, meat and later bechamel sauce with some parmesan cheese (no ricotta)! We promise it’s delicious 🙂 </p>
<p> Love it ! But i used more tomatoes than what it Calls for and 1/2 lb of minced mushrooms… came out incredible </p>
<p> Thank you very much for your amazing recipe! Grazie mille! I just made it for my family- we’ve never eaten such a delicious lasagna:) so simple and it really works. I used to think that lasagna was quite a boring watery ready thing from supermarkets… but it’s not! Dalla Russia con amore:) to your lasagna! </p>
<p> I just finished making this using the recipe as is (although I must admit I too was tempted to add some fresh basil and more tomato paste or passata – but decided not to fiddle with it in the end.) It’s fantastic – thanks for sharing the recipe. I’m guessing (not being Italian) that different regions may have different “authentic” recipes, which may account for some of the comments above. To one person’s comment – next time I make it I think I will try swapping out the ground meat for a slow cooked meat on the bone…I suspect it will be even more tasty! (BTW I’m confused about using ricotta in lasagna – I don’t think Im aware of people doing that in Australia – is it a substitute for the bechamel?) </p>
<p> Some people like to accompany lasagna with ricotta but personally we prefer besciamella for the filling! </p>
<p> I am just about to make this but can only use fresh bought pasta sheets, how much should I buy? Am I right in thinking that the finished layer is pasta sheet besciamella sauce and then ragu? My own recipe finishes with a pasta sheet! Looking forward to this recipe. Thank you </p>
<p> We like to finish the top sheet with more besciamella and ragu to keep it all moist! </p>
<p> Just made this today. I stared the ragu at 9:00 and baked the lasagna at 6:00 pm. This is the BEST lasagna that I’ve ever had . I’ll never use any other lasagna recipe. Thank you so much for this! </p>
<p> This is what we had at a winery in the Tuscany region. I was amazed how delicious it was. I will never use ricotta in my lasagne again! </p>
<p> This recipe is very close to one I used to make years ago but I lost it. Thanks to you it is found again, the only difference is that i would melt ricotta in the beschamel sauce. Other than that it is perfect. Had a group for dinner and it is usually a good sign when it is quiet while they eat with a small groan on occasion. They were fighting for the remaining lasagna. I LOVE this recipe!!! </p>
<p> This is how my sweet husband from Genoa taught me to make lasagna forty some years ago? My sister in laws family is from Bologna and her sauce is very similar. It’s fantastic there should not be basil, oregano or other herbs in this. Thanks for posting a real Italian recipe! Gigi </p>
<p> I’m looking forward to making this as my Italy loving family are joining us for Xmas. I want to freeze it. If I can source fresh am I to understand that I don’t cook it beforehand but make sure it is thawed and then cooked. With precooked pasta sheets I cook, freeze and the reheat after thawing? Looking forward to reply. Thanks. We loved Bologna! </p>
<p> Sorry for the delay, but you’re right, you don’t cook it beforehand. Just make it up, freeze it and then the night before you want to cook it take it out to defrost completely in your refrigerator before cooking. </p>
<p> For Christmas, are there traditional side dishes you’d suggest serving with the lasagna? Wine recommendations? This recipe seems very similar to my mother-in-law’s (that no one can find) so looking forward to seeing (and tasting!) how similar it actually is! Thank you! </p>
<p> Sorry that it’s not for Christmas, but generally lasagna is a one-plate meal. Remember, Italians separate their food into appetizers, a “primo” of pasta or rice and a “secondo”of meat or fish. You could serve your lasagna as a primo and then make meat and veggies for a secondo. Any nice, strong red wine would work well! </p>
<p> I definitely wish I had doubled this recipe as it’s barely enough meat and sauce to fit a regular sized lasagna pan! Hopingnit still tastes good when I bake it. I couldn’t find anywhere in the recipe how many servings it made so I just assumed it would make enough for a regular lasagne pan. </p>
<p> Have been to Italy many times , the lasagne does vary from region to region , i suppose it goes back to what was available at the time , you certainly could not afford to waste anything ,i think with most cooking , slow and long bring out the flavours , have you ever had a stew etc the next day ,how much better it tastes ,will try this recipe . </p>

<p> Italian Life Rules – Superstitions, Familiar and Strange </p>
<p> The first use of the Latin superstitio is found in the writing of the historians Livy and Ovid (1st century BC). At that time the term “superstition” was used in Italy mostly in the negative sense of an excessive fear of the gods or unreasonable religious belief, as opposed to religio, the proper, reasonable awe of the gods. </p>
<p> The term superstitio, or superstitio vana (vain superstition) was applied by Tacitus and Domitian (80 AD) to those religious cults (druids, early Christianity) in the Roman Empire that were officially outlawed. </p>
<p> Throughout history, Italian culture has been rich with superstitions for good or evil that continue to form the basis of many of the Italian Life Rules. Today a visitor may be surprised at which superstitions are taken seriously and which are taken with a grain of salt, so to speak. </p>
<p> Here is a non-inclusive list of Italian superstitions so that you don’t put a foot wrong during your next visit: </p>
<p> The Evil Eye (Malocchio) </p>
<p> The Evil Eye is one of the most ancient superstitions in Italy. Every region seems to have their own version of the Evil Eye, but some take it more seriously than others. One thing they seem to have in common is that the Evil Eye is caused by jealousy and envy. One test for the Malocchio is done by dropping olive oil in a plate of water. If the oil forms one large drop in the middle of the plate it’s a sure sign of the Evil Eye, but after chanting the right prayers that usually only women are allowed to know, the oil may break up into tiny droplets and spread out, thus breaking the curse of the Evil Eye. The cornicello (see below) is also used to ward off the malocchio. </p>
<p> The Devil’s Horn (Corno) </p>
<p> The use of the Corno, or Devil’s Horn, is a curse of impotency or of the cuckold. The twisted phallic red coral, gold or silver amulet (cornicello) is often worn or carried by men to ward off curses on their “manliness” or mojo. Although many claim the amulet represents one of the horns of the devil, the Corno predates Christianity by thousands of years. The horned god Faunus was known for his wild nature and interest in fertility. The ancient Romans knew well Cernunnos, the horned Celtic god of fertility, life, animals, wealth, and the underworld. The horns of an African eland most resemble the original amulets. </p>
<p> Related to the Corno is the hand gesture (extending only the pinkie and index finger like a pair of horns) known as the mano cornuta, which can be used (pointing upwards or directly at the victim (cornuto)) to curse another or not so subtly send the message that a man’s wife or girlfriend is straying. This gesture can also be used to ward off the Evil Eye (pointing fingers down). </p>
<p> Lucky Numbers </p>
<p> The number 13 is lucky in Italy, especially when gambling. The number 13 is also associated with the Goddess of Fertility and the lunar cycles. It is thought the number brings prosperity and abundant life. Although 13 is considered lucky, sitting down to a table with 12 others is an ill omen. At the Last Supper Jesus ate with his 12 disciples before one of them, Judas Iscariot, betrayed him. Italians aim to avoid a similar turning of the tables. In modern times it seems the Friday 13 is starting to lose its charm in Italy, as with the rest of the world. </p>
<p> Unlucky Numbers </p>
<p> The number 17 is considered unlucky. This has to do with how it is written. Italians dislike the number so much that some hotels don’t have a 17th level. When 17 is written using Roman numerals XVII, it can be rearranged to spell the Roman word VIXI meaning “I have lived” and is found on ancient tombstones, thus tempting death. When written using Arabic numerals, 17 is still considered unlucky since it resembles a man ( the 1) hanging from a gallows (the 7). </p>
<p> Superstitions Pertaining to Bread </p>
<p> A loaf of bread must always be placed face up, or else bad luck will come. Again, some claim this has a basis in Christianity with the symbol of Christ as the Bread of Life. It is impolite to turn the bread up-side-down or to stick a knife into a loaf of bread. Bread is considered a staple of life and so every precaution is taken in order to prevent cursing the supply. </p>
<p> No Birds in the House </p>
<p> The presence of a bird in the house (either as a pet or accidentally) brings bad luck. Mere bird feathers, especially peacock feathers with their Evil Eye, can curse a household or the wearer of a feathery hat. Some say the superstition has a Christian origin from the Bible story where Peter denied that he knew Jesus three times before the cock crowed. Paintings of birds are also be avoided. </p>
<p> Blessing/Exorcising a New House </p>
<p> The blessing or exorcism of a new house in Italy is still practiced, especially when it comes to newlyweds. Moving into a first home was accompanied by the necessary rituals to rid the place of any spirits that may have ben left by the previous owners and could harm the new couple or their first child. A new broom is a common first gift to sweep away evil spirits. Sprinkled salt in the corners of the house will purify it. Neighborhood priests go house to house before Easter to bless each home with holy water (in modern times a tiny note is frequently wedged in the door to notify the residents of the service). </p>
<p> The Witchdoctor (Mago/Maga) </p>
<p> Southern Italians, Sardinians and Sicilians, mostly of the older generation, still mix folk medicine and ancient superstitions. When home remedies did not work and modern medicine was not an option (from either lack of money or language), some neighborhoods have the services of a man or woman trained in ancient practices, bordering on witchcraft. </p>
<p> Older Sicilians can recall ancient rites, involving making dolls to curse an enemy, amulets to protect themselves from evil, or, on the more positive side, love potions to encourage a slow suitor. </p>
<p> Marriage Superstitions </p>
<p> Singles, don’t let a broom touch your feet when someone is cleaning the floors. If you do, you will never be swept off your feet and get married. Likewise, never sweep over the feet of an unmarried person, or they will never marry. </p>
<p> Cats – Good and Bad </p>
<p> It’s bad luck to have a black cat cross your path. On the other hand, it’s considered a good fortune if you happen to hear a cat sneeze. </p>
<p> What Not to Put on a Bed </p>
<p> Don’t put a hat on a bed. Traditionally, when the sick were on their deathbeds a priest would come to receive their final confessions. The priest would remove his hat and set it on the bed so that he could put on the vestments. Thus, a hat’s temporary resting place is associated with eternal rest, a thought that keeps Italians from sleeping peacefully. </p>
<p> A bed should never face the door because it replicate the position of a coffin in a church. </p>
<p> Other unlucky items to keep off the bed are clothes hangers, hairbrushes, and shoes (of course the last is a hygiene issue, too). </p>
<p> Bad Luck Toasting </p>
<p> Never raise a toast with a glass full of water as it is bad luck. Don’t cross arms when you clink wine glasses together. Also, be sure look fellow toasters in the eye when clinking glasses and don’t slip up by forgetting to take a sip before setting your drink down, otherwise you will have seven years of bad sex. </p>
<p> Spills of All Kinds </p>
<p> Don’t spill salt or olive oil for fear of bad luck. This conception may have begun as a trick to motivate people to handle the previously expensive goods with care. If it happens, however, toss a bit of salt over each shoulder or rub a drop of oil behind each ear. If you spill wine at the dinner table, wet your fingers and dab some behind every person’s ear. </p>
<p> Hearses – Coming and Going </p>
<p> Don’t follow a hearse that isn’t carrying a coffin. You are in death’s wake and soon people might be attending your funeral. However, if the hearse bears a body, it isn’t in pursuit of another passenger, so you are safe, just like if you pass a hearse driving in the opposite direction. </p>
<p> A Word to the Wise </p>
<p> Never trim toe and finger nails on Thursday. </p>
<p> Don’t start a journey, new project or get married on a Friday or a Tuesday. </p>
<p> Never have your hair cut during the new moon. </p>
<p> Never get a perm during your menstrual cycle. </p>
<p> Eat plenty of lentils on New Years’ Eve. </p>
<p> If you give a gift of a new wallet, always put at least a coin in it. </p>
<p> To prevent a downturn of fortune people practice tocca ferro and touch iron if they think something bad is going to occur. Italian men, knowing what must be protected at all costs, may tap their testicles, known as tocca palle. This is similar to knocking on wood. </p>
<p> Good Omens </p>
<p> Seeing a spider at night: a sure sign of monetary income. </p>
<p> When you drop something then someone is thinking of you and their name starts with the first letter of item dropped. (Drop a pen (penn a) and Pamela is thinking of you.) </p>
<p> When your nose itches, it’s either “pugni o baci,” punches or kisses. </p>
<p> Finding a button on the ground: a new friendship is on the horizon. </p>
<p> Dreaming of someone dying and you will have added ten years to their life. </p>
<p> When a new moon appears, the minute you see it say the New Moon Incantation: “Benvenuta Luna che mi porti fortuna!” – “Welcome, moon and may you bring me good fortune!” This is to be repeated, bowing respectfully at the lunar sliver 13 times with a coin in each hand. </p>
<p> Eat lentils on New Years Day and money will follow during the year. </p>
<p> Bad Omens </p>
<p> Killing a spider will take money away. </p>
<p> Breaking a mirror will result in seven years of bad luck. </p>
<p> Giving a handkerchief as a gift will bring tears. </p>
<p> Crossing silverware on the table foretells strife. </p>
<p> Passing each other the salt hand to hand (without putting it down on the table) will lead to imminent fight between the two. </p>
<p> Nuns crossing your path (or is this only for school children?). </p>
<p> Walking under a ladder. </p>
<p> Crossing arms when shaking hands in a group. </p>
<p> An owl sighting is a vision of the spirits of the dead. </p>

<p> 43 thoughts on “Italian Life Rules – Superstitions, Familiar and Strange” </p>
<p> Hello, I recently came across this site and I must say the thoughts and the stories told here are quite interesting and fascinating. I might be interested in purchasing “Italian Life Rules” once it comes out, so I was wondering if you could confirm it will be released in Summer 2014. And if yes, is it already possible to know by which month it will be available? The questions extend to the paperback version, since that is the one I would be willing to buy the most. Thank you in advance. </p>
<p> Francesco, no date has been set for the launch, but it will be announced in TuscanTraveler.com first. </p>
<p> I grew up with some of these.. two that were not mentioned that come to mind are as follows. This came from my grandmother who is Napolidan. </p>
<p> 1. An unmarried women or young girl should never sit at the corner of a table or she will never be wed. </p>
<p> 2. Never put your bed against a wall on either side. The bed must be open on both sides or the person will never be wed. </p>
<p> 3. A baby or child incapable of warding off the evil eye themselves should always have something red on. </p>
<p> 4. It is very bad luck to ever put shoes on anything other than the ground. </p>
<p> 5. Always put your right shoe on first or you will have a bad day… Always start your day on the right foot. </p>
<p> Thanks Nikki for the additional superstitions! </p>
<p> My grandma always said that if you wanted to remove a wart, you should steal a dish towel from someone, rub it on your wart, and bury it under a full moon. As the dish towel rots away in the dirt your wart fades away. </p>
<p> My family is Neapolitan and Sicilian with a bit of Northern regions like Milan. My family taught me these things over the years of growing up: </p>
<p> 1. When receiving communion your hair must be worn in a bun. </p>
<p> 2. The sex of your child can be determined by the way a necklace and pendant swings. </p>
<p> 3. The sounds of bells in the middle of the night signal good luck. Kind of like an angel earning their wings. </p>
<p> 4. If you receive a dream from a past ancestor it may be good luck and an omen of the future. Listen carefully. </p>
<p> 5. Silverware dropping on the floor means someone is coming to your house. </p>

<p> Thanks for all of these, Katelyn. What a fabulous list. Ann </p>
<p> my father was from the Calabria region, and he told me to never accept a knife as a gift, Always pay for it. If you drop a knife always step(stomp) on it. It was to protect you from The knife. </p>
<p> I have been DESPERATELY seeking a Strega for almost a year now. For more than 2 years I have been victim to the malocchio. </p>
<p> I believe. Seeing is believing. My Aunt was the one I was a witness to helping others. She helped me, too. Like most others as her, she is dead. </p>
<p> I am at the lowest point in my life; healthwise, financially… a week doesn’t go by where I get smacked in the face by the curse. I was very well of; making good money, big house, 7 cars. Now no job. 59 year old engineers cannot compete with college graduates. Lost my business, too. I have no car. House is in foreclosure. The list is long, but so is this message. I’ll stop now. I live in NJ. I can travel. Does anyone know where I can find help? </p>
<p> The church is not the answer. I need a Strega. Mille grazie. </p>
<p> i grew up in italy with a very superstitious mother, aunt and grandmother . I remember hearing of most of the superstitions mentioned and have a few to add. Seeing a priest walking towards you brings good news. Seeing two nuns together brings unpleasant or disappointing news. Seeing a hay wagon represents money coming your way. Seeing piles of straw or a straw wagon means disappointment. can’t wait for the book to come out – it would be a great gift. </p>
<p> You missed the one about if a lady bug flies into a bedroom in Italy it bring very much good luck. </p>
<p> From my mom & aunts (my grandparents were from Bari) who grew up in Brooklyn and Queens… </p>
<p> When driving past a cemetery, lift your feet off the floor of the car and hold your breath until you pass it. </p>
<p> Dropped silverware means “company’s coming!” If it’s a fork or knife, a man–a spoon, a woman. </p>
<p> Eat pickled herring on New Year’s Eve for prosperity. My godmother would go around shoving the fish into our mouths at family parties each year. </p>
<p> Don’t use a knife or scissor to cut the ribbon or string off a wrapped gift–or else risk cutting the relationship. </p>
<p> Store clean cups and drinking glasses upright in the cabinet–never open side down (which causes bad luck). </p>
<p> Some of the above I have also heard, growing up with Italian American parents. My mom was from Tuscany and my dad’s family was from an area not far from Naples. My paternal grandmother yelled at me (when I was a teen) in Italian one day as I watered the houseplants. She said I would kill the plants. My mom told her it was that time of month for me…and she believed that it would kill plants if you touched them at that time of month. Oh, and my grandmother knew a chant to remove the evil eye. I wish I knew it. It started with 8, 9 in Italian….something about lupo too I think…My sister married Sicilian and she had a multitude of superstitions. One was that you should never hand someone a knife directly, but rather put it on a table or object, or you will stop talking with that person. She also said that shoes can never be put on the table in a box or otherwise…bad luck. She has more, but I don’t know them all. </p>
<p> Thanks you all for sharing today’s word of superstitious appreciate ya, & as well which I didn’t cross so I am not a fosure ifor it may or may not be superstitious. Never walk under any ladders it cause bad luck; Never call out any of God’s name while using the restroom’s home or public it cause illnesses; Havah Happy New Year’s Peace Upon You & Your’s* </p>
<p> Interesting…I remember my grandma telling me many of these. </p>
<p> Did anyone ever hear of leaving 3 dollars in the pocket of the deceased? Does anyone know what it means? I never heard this one before. </p>
<p> Never put a scissor on the bed. It will cause divorce </p>
<p> Bad Luck to put A New Pair Of shoes on a Table /also a Hairbrush </p>
<p> Dear Eleonora, I will be happy to add a link to your website. I talked to Florentine friends and reviewed dozens of web sites, magazines and books to create my post. I confirmed each item I listed with more than one source. Your website has an excellent list of superstitions found in the theater and general superstitions found worldwide, as well as those found in southern Italy. Buona fortuna, Ann </p>
<p> What does it mean, if a man has an affair with a woman in her bed, and places the husband’s shoes on his rearview mirror? </p>
<p> My great grandmother (Italian and Catholic) was said to have made little satchels that she prayed over to bring good fortune. The only ingredient of the satchel that anyone can remember is salt. I’d love to know more about it. Has anyone heard of this? </p>
<p> Amber….salt a penny a morsal of bread a piece of red ribbon a droplet of holy water. </p>
<p> Wow, my mom is 92 year old Sicilian and does not remember this, but, one of my cousins wants to know if anyone remembers this one: my grandma putting a coin in a cheesecloth and rubbing it on someone’s sore muscles then lighting it on fire and covering with a glass. Maybe an early form of “cupping” that they are using on Olympic swimmers? Hoping someone else remembers this. My mom did say she remembers when someone had sore knees, the little kids were given sticks to clap and say prayers, then hold sticks on the sore knees. Any details are appreciated. Thank you. </p>
<p> anyone ever hear that if you don;t sweep a floor clean you will have a bald husband </p>
<p> What’s the one about the touching testicles when you see/have to pass a Nun? </p>
<p> Here’s a little story for you: </p>
<p> About 12 years ago, while I was away at college, I was planning my trip back home for the Christmas break. I told my parents I’d be taking the Greyhound bus home on the 17th. My strict Italian dad said NO WAY! It’s bad luck! So I caught the bus the day earlier to avoid the bad omen. The thing is, I hopped on the bus at 9pm, and it travels through the night. Would you believe that my bus caught on fire at 2am on the 17th? When I called my parents to tell them what happened, the first thing my dad said was, I TOLD YOU!! Needless to say, I now look out for that number. </p>
<p> We are Calabrese so I know many of these…especially about malocchio. My mother taught me the prayer when I was about 19. It could only be passed on to me on Christmas day at midnight! She wrote it on a piece of paper while we were at midnight mass. I read it and memorized. She said once you know the prayer you will never forget it. It’s true! I’ve lost the paper but still remember it word for word. </p>
<p> A funny story about the 17th as well. My mom was born on Nov.17th but her father wrote her date of birth as Nov. 16th on her birth certificate. Apparently, back in the day the parents filled out the birth certificate. About 10 years later her brother was also born Nov. 17th…what are the odds? And they wrote the 18th as the date of birth. You have no idea how much trouble this has caused my mom when she puts her birthrate down as Nov 17th but records state the 16th. All because 17 is bad luck! </p>
<p> However, both siblings have lived happy & prosperous lives, much more so than the other 4 siblings… so I would say it worked out well for them. </p>
<p> Years later, her baby brother (#6) was threatening to arrive, on you guessed it, Nov. 17th! My Nonna said no! This is not happening again! So she held on for as long as she could and he was born on the 19th. </p>
<p> Has anyone heard of a red ribbon and a pinch of salt thrown in back seat of car. </p>
<p> Has anyone heard that it is bad luck to wash your wedding dress after the wedding day </p>
<p> I only knew one ritual my mother followed. it was to cut the hair in march but I forget when. does anyone know. its not a full cut but a piece. thanks </p>
<p> My dad is Black and my mother was mixed race. She believed every one of these superstitions. Crossing her on one of them or disobeying one in front of her meant certain death for you. We knew she was part Asian but didn’t know anything else was in there. A few years ago we did DNA on the family and there it was: she was about 40% Italian and it was from Tuscany. Now we know why she knew and believed all these. </p>
<p> I believe them all too, especially the hat on the bed one. Here’s some more she used to warn us about: </p>
<p> 1. If you drop a spoon unexpectedly, a woman will unexpectedly visit. If a fork a man. </p>
<p> 2. If a cat washes over its left ear, it will soon rain. </p>
<p> 3. If rain starts in the morning before seven, it will stop by eleven. </p>
<p> I remember some of these. My grandfather used to tell me some of the stories about being careful walking past street vendors in Sicily. He said if you were disrespectful, they would curse you, or give you the evil eye. He got everyone in the family horn necklaces. Corno’s for the men, and cornicello’s for the women. </p>
<p> The question about the man having an affair. Answer is If he hangs the husbands shoes on his rear view mirror the husband cannot follow him. </p>
<p> What is the prayer to take evil eye away? </p>
<p> Friends, </p>
<p> I know about the evil eye but there is an Italian curse called the Fatuda. I don’t know if I am spelling it properly. Does anyone have any info on this or grandparents that could explain how it’s given and taken away??? Thank you! </p>
<p> I know my Nonna’s remedy for the evil eye. I have done it before. She said I was too young to learn her ways and was supposed to start teaching me the year she died but I remember what I saw her pray as a little girl. Also does anyone know of a Sicilian or Italian custom of a woman only cutting her hair in mourning? Or was that just my mother’s personal superstition? </p>
<p> As for the cutting your hair in March it may be The Ides Of March, when Caesar died. I don’t know that particular one my mother always said to plant your seedlings for the garden in the Ides of March but that was obviously pre-global warning hehe. </p>

<p> I've made this lots and I don't think salt pepper or even the oil (as long as you're using a dressing with oil in it) are necessary. BBQ is my favorite way to cook this chicken up. Last time I bought a big package of chicken breasts split them up and put them each in ziploc bags with the marinade then stacked 2 in the freezer and left one out for dinner. Later I pull one of the frozen bags out and it marinates while it defrosts. Super easy. Read More </p>

<p> Good Stuff! I made a few changes though. Instead of regular Italian Dressing I used Kraft Free Italian Fat Free Dressing and it tasted GREAT! I also baked the chicken breasts at 350 for 40 minutes and it was perfect!!! DH even loved it and he hates Italian Dressing!! Thanks so much JWilliams!!! Read More </p>
<p> I used half a bottle of Kraft light italian dressing 1/4 c. of olive oil vs. veg. oil no salt some cracked black pepper 3 cloves of minced garlic and added a tsp. each of basil oregano rosemary and thyme. I pounded the chicken down thin and put everything in a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day. I grilled mine vs. cooking on the stove. It goes great over angel hair pasta. Read More </p>

<p> I've been marinating chicken breast like this for years it's one of our favorite recipes! First I season the chicken with salt and pepper and italian seasoning then add the italian dressing. Marinate for a few hours then bake at 375 for about 35 minutes. Serve with a side of pasta or rice and steamed veggies. Read More </p>
<p> If you don't have a full bottle that's fine you really just need enough to cover the meat. I used a ziploc bag to marinate in for two days only because I had the time. The chicken is great for a quick meal. I added a few tablespoons of sesamee seeds to jazz it up. Best with a simple green veggie. Read More </p>

<p> Italiano pork chops </p>
<p> Flavourful, tender pork chops with a little bit of Italian pizzazz! Lovely with a creamy mash on the side. </p>
<p> Method Prep:15min › Cook:1hr10min › Ready in:1hr25min </p>
<p> Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and set aside. </p>
<p> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the pork chops, browning on both sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Place the pork chops on a plate, then drain all but 1 tablespoon of drippings from the pan. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Pour in the tomatoes, then season with basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Transfer the pork chops back to the pan; cover and simmer until the pork chops are tender and no longer pink in the centre, about 45 minutes. Stir in some water if the mixture becomes too dry. Place the green pepper on top of the pork and add the reserved mushrooms. Continue to simmer until the green pepper is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Tip: </p>
<p> Don't add the green pepper wedges until your chops are cooked through, otherwise, they will turn to mush. </p>

<p> Followed the recipe as written. These were good, but not great. I would highly suggest seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper as you're browning them, because although the sauce is flavorful enough, the chops themselves were on the bland side. Also, my chops turned out dry and I don't know if this was due to the long simmering time or what. On the plus side, this recipe is easy and presents nicely. - 22 Nov 2011 (Review from Allrecipes US | Canada) </p>

<p> The secret to moist pork chops is to use bone in chops. The boneless chops dry out during the simmering process. - 19 Dec 2011 (Review from Allrecipes US | Canada) </p>

<p> These pork chops were tender and juicy and had a lot of flavor. We loved them! I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms (didn't have any) and I left out the salt (personal preference). This is a terrific quick and easy weeknight dinner that everyone will love. - 16 Oct 2011 (Review from Allrecipes US | Canada) </p>

<p> I seem to avoid pork chops because mine turn out so dry but these were spectacular! So juicy and the flavors were wonderful. My family can’t wait for me to make this again. </p>
<p> I’m still thinking about how good this pork was! I made extra house seasoning blend for this weekend. We’re grilling out and I just know it’s going to be amazing on the chicken! </p>
<p> This recipe sounds delicious, but must I buy more difficult to find spices? First what is “House Seasoning Blend”? Second what is “”Porketta Seasoning Blend”? I live in a small town and do not have access to grocery stores with a lot of ethnic type spices. I had to order garam masala online. Please tell me that it is worth the effort. And also what they are. </p>

<p> Easy Italian Pork Chops Recipe </p>
<p> Last updated: March 15, 2020 | Originally Published: March 15, 2020 by Linda Warren </p>
<p> These Italian Pork Chops, simmered in a rich tomato basil sauce, are the perfect easy one pot dinner. The chops come out moist & tender and, best part of all, prep for 15 and let simmer, hands-off, for 30 minutes! It makes a great weeknight dinner served over pasta or zoodles so you can soak up all that delicious sauce! </p>
<p> I love pork chops just about any way they can be fixed but my Mom used to fix us these Italian pork chops that just can’t be beat. They are so easy to make that you can whip them up in about 45 minutes (and most of that is just sitting on the stove simmering). And the nice part is that if you leave it on a little longer because you got busy something else and forgot, I am not mentioning any names, it will be just as good or even better! </p>
<p> 7 Ingredients To A Delicious Dinner </p>
<p> It’s such an easy recipe that you’ll wonder whey you never made it before. Only 7 ingredients that go together so well. Plus, the only cooking you need to do is brown the pork chops and saute the onions and garlic then let it simmer away until you’re ready to eat. See, simple, right? Not only does this recipe take only 15 minutes of prep but there is only 1 skillet to clean up afterwards. That’s what I call a win-win. Serve these Italian Pork Chops, as I do, over zoodles, for a nice low carb, high protein dinner. Or course, they go just as deliciously with everyone’s favorite pasta. And don’t forget that glass of wine! 🙂 </p>
<p> FAQs </p>
<p> Do I need to use boneless pork chops? </p>
<p> Not at all! You can use either bone-in or boneless. If using bone-in, cook them slightly longer. In fact, you’ll probably find the bone-in ones comes out slightly more tender. </p>
<p> How thick of a pork chop should I purchase? </p>
<p> I like to get chops that are between 3/4″ to 1″ thick. If you have less thick ones, adjust the cooking time downward. </p>
<p> What else can I serve with this recipe? </p>
<p> I’ve served this dish over pasta and rice or riced cauliflower or zoodles, which are great low carb options. To serve over zoodles, just remove pork chops from pan at the end of cooking and toss zucchini noodles into sauce just long enough to heat up. </p>
<p> Can I make this ahead of time? </p>
<p> Of course! I like to make mine the night before up to the simmering stage. I keep it in the refrigerator then return it to the skillet about 40 minutes before dinner and it marinate in the marinara. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Heat oil in a large skillet and add pork chops. </p>
<p> Give them a nice sear on both sides then remove from skillet. </p>
<p> Add chopped onion and garlic to the skillet and saute for about 5 minutes. You want the onion to be soft and translucent which helps bring out the sweet flavor. </p>
<p> You see all those nice browned pork bits in the bottom of the pan? These help bring tons of flavor to the dish. Add wine and stir to deglaze (meaning scraping up all those flavorful bits) </p>
<p> Return pork chops to pan. </p>
<p> Top with spaghetti sauce and fresh basil leaves. Cover and simmer. </p>

<p> Italian Pork Chops </p>
<p> Guys, it is fall now which means you’re starting to be surrounded by loads of comfort food and sweet treats. It’s tough to stay healthy and fit with so many temptations. I believe in eating in moderation so I balance out the yummy Caramel Apple Cheesecake Bars with healthy meals like these Italian Pork Chops. </p>
<p> These Italian Pork Chops require just a few ingredients and are baked in the oven with loads of veggies. Have it ready and on the table in just 30 minutes. </p>
<p> The time between when the kids get home from school and dinner can be pretty rough. Kids are tired from school, hangry, there are activities to go to… there’s just not a ton of time to prepare a healthy meal for the family. Meals like 20-Minute Simple Salmon & Asparagus and these Italian Pork Chops are perfect for those stressful nights when you need to get dinner on the table fast. </p>
<p> I like to use bone-in pork chops because the bone gives more flavor but it totally works with boneless too. This recipe is flexible so if you need to feed more than four, just add a few more chops. </p>
<p> To assemble this practically one pan meal, just throw the veggies on the pan, toss with a mixture of oil, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese and rub the pork chops with the same seasonings. Pop it in the oven, flipping the pork chops halfway through, and end it by broiling until perfectly browned. </p>
<p> Sprinkle on more Parmesan if desired, but who doesn’t have that desire, pleaz. Serve with a side of orzo, pasta, rice, baked potato… Voila! A quick, tasty, healthy, and balanced meal for the whole family. </p>
<p> As much as I love the tender flavorful pork, the veggies in this dish are awesome. I could eat these roasted veggies all day long. And what’s great is my kids like them too. I hop you enjoy this meal as much as we do. </p>

<p> Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I add mushrooms and pearl onions and double the seasoning. I am diabetic and it lowers my blood sugar! </p>
<p> Excellent recipe. Followed it roughly. Inspired me to use fresh herbs (rosemary, oregano, basil, garlic) and garden veggies that had been staring at me for days (zucchini, squash, red peppers, onion). Add some cubed rosemary and olive oil potatoes roasted in the oven at the same time, and this recipe made a weekday meal to remember out of some plain old chops. Throw in an ’07 super tuscan and we’re more than good to go. </p>

<p> Italian Pork Chop Sheet Pan Dinner </p>
<p> Can you believe summer is winding down with some kids already heading back to school?! I’ll be honest, I’m just not ready. </p>
<p> For me, summer is all about the freedom of having a looser schedule. Things move at a slower, less hectic pace. It usually involves later bedtimes and sleeping-in in the mornings. I’m not really looking forward to early mornings again. I’m not. </p>
<p> The school year always brings jam-packed days with some days leaving me feeling like I haven’t even had a chance to sit down all day, let alone try to think about dinner plans. </p>
<p> That’s where Smithfield All Natural Fresh Pork come in! It is available at Walmart and is an easy, everyday option for delicious recipes!

<p> My family loves sheet pan meals. I particularly like how easy they are to make and how little clean-up there is. </p>
<p> For this Italian Pork Chop recipe, I start by getting the potatoes ready and in the oven while I prepare the rest of the dish. In the time it takes to semi-roast the potatoes, I can rinse off and trim the green beans, rinse the tomatoes, and get the Smithfield All Natural Boneless Pork Chops all seasoned and ready to go. </p>
<p> Although I used boneless pork chops, feel free to use Smithfield All Natural Bone-in Pork Chops if you prefer. You may need to adjust the baking time slightly. Be sure to cook pork to a minimum internal temperature of 145 °F as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. </p>

For those nights when I need something even quicker and easier – or when everyone is eating at different times – this sheet pan dinner is a great recipe choice. Smithfield® is guaranteed tender, making it the perfect option for a meal prep recipe! </p>

<p> Italian Sheet Pan Pork Chops and Vegetables </p>
<p> Italian Sheet Pan Pork Chops and Vegetables is an incredibly easy 20-minute dinner perfect for busy weeknights. Delicious, simple cleanup, with Italian flavors we love. </p>
<p> Specially designed for those nights when the last things on earth you want to do… is wash another pan. I know you have those nights. I do too. The only alternative is a one-pot or sheet pan dinner. </p>
<p> One Pan </p>
<p> After seasoning the bone-in pork chops with salt and pepper, lay them in the center of a sheet pan. Chop the veggies, toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper and transfer to the sheet pan with the chops. Sprinkle some herbs… and bake. That’s it! </p>
<p> How Long Do These Sheet Pan Pork Chops Take? </p>
<p> How does 20 minutes sound? Perfect for busy weeknights. A few minutes in prep, chopping the vegetables, and 20 minutes to bake. The pork chops will make their own sauce as they bake, so it’s juicy and tender. </p>
<p> Mixing it Up with Seasonal Vegetables </p>
<p> In the spring, I love to add asparagus. The summer and fall seasons bring endless possibilities of fresh garden fresh vegetables. Zucchini is an always favorite, along with peppers, tomatoes and anything else tasty I find in the garden. </p>
<p> During the winter, I love to add sliced butternut squash, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. </p>
<p> Serve with a side of buttered noodles, a side green salad, and dinner is done! </p>
<p> Italian Sheet Pan Pork Chops and Vegetables </p>
<p> Yield: 4 servings </p>
<p> Prep Time: 10 minutes </p>
<p> Cook Time: 20 minutes </p>
<p> Total Time: 30 minutes </p>
<p> Italian Sheet Pan Pork Chops and Vegetables is an easy 20-minute dinner perfect for busy weeknights. A go-to delicious and simple dinner idea! </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 1 15-oz can fire-roasted diced tomatoes, with their juices </p>
<p> 1 teaspoon dried basil </p>
<p> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano </p>
<p> salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 400-degrees. Salt and pepper both sides of the pork chops and place on an ungreased, rimmed sheet pan. </p>
<p> Add the onion, red pepper, garlic, zucchini, and mushrooms to a medium-sized bowl. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper; toss. Transfer the vegetables in a single layer onto the sheet pan with the pork chops. Then sprinkle with basil and oregano over both the pork chops and vegetables. </p>
<p> Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until it reaches your preferred internal temperature. Remove the chops to a platter and return the sheet pan to the oven. Broil the vegetables for 3-5 minutes, or until they are slightly caramelized. Layer the vegetables onto a serving platter with the pork chops and serve. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> Pork Chop Notes: I prefer to use bone-in pork chops because it adds a juicy, tender element to the meat. Depending on thickness, adjust cooking time accordingly. The USDA recommends pork chops be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145-degrees. To be honest -- I like mine more done. The 20 minute cooking time in this recipe reflects that. Adjust to your taste. </p>

<p> Italian info </p>
<p> Italian is without a doubt one of the UK's favourite imported cuisines - no British high street is complete without a branch of one of the many Italian chains and a handful of independent 'ristoranti italiani'. </p>
<p> However as this comprehensive collection of Italian recipes shows, there's so much more to Italian cuisine than pizza and pasta. Each region has its own very unique gastronomic heritage, for example Paul Ainsworth's arancini are deep-fried rice balls originating in Sicily while hearty polenta, which Tom Aikens makes with basil, is typical of Northern Italian fare. These fantastic Italian recipes are both delicious and suitable for any occasion. Buon Appetito! </p>

<p> Who better to turn to for top-notch Italian food than the people who cook it for a living? </p>
<p> Feb 26, 2019 4:00am </p>
<p> Some of our favourite chefs from around the country (and one from Rome) have rummaged through their scrapbooks, and handed over their favourite Italian recipes. Because who better to turn to for reliable and delicious Italian recipes than the people who cook it for a living? </p>

<p> A Guide to Italian Salami, Charcuterie, and Cold Cuts </p>
<p> Food, wine, and travel writer Kyle Phillips lived in Tuscany and developed his passion and expertise for food and cooking through travel. </p>
<p> Italian cold cuts are often made from pork: salami, prosciutto, salsiccia, finocchiona, pancetta, and so on, which are collectively referred to as salumi. In the past, these were all made when hogs were butchered in late fall or early winter and set aside to guarantee a supply of meat during the warmer months when uncured meats would spoil rapidly. Since their names vary considerably from place to place within Italy, we'll begin by saying what these terms mean in Tuscany: </p>
<p> Salami </p>
<p> It's a large (3-4 inches across) sausage made with ground pork and cubes of fat, seasoned with garlic, salt, and spices, and stuffed into the pig's large intestine. It's smaller cousin is salamino, with a similar filling (the fat may be ground somewhat finer) but only 1-inch thick. The town of Felino, in Emilia Romagna, is famed for its salamino. Salamino piccante, spicy salamino, is made with enough red pepper to give it that familiar orange cast; in the US it's known as pepperoni. </p>
<p> Prosciutto </p>
<p> People have written books about Northern Italy's cured raw hams. Broadly speaking, they can be divided into two categories, dolce (sweet), and salato, casalingo, or Toscano (salty, homemade, or Tuscan). The former is more refined and more expensive. </p>
<p> The most common varieties of prosciutto dolce are Parma and San Daniele. Both should have deep red meat and pure white fat. The former are rounded and rather stubby, while the latter are pressed to give them their characteristic "Stradivarian" shape (by women, according to the Consorzio—men lack the necessary touch). </p>
<p> Prosciutto salato, on the other hand, is more heavily salted and is also rubbed with a spice mixture called agliata, made with garlic and pepper. The meat is frequently darker in color, and the fat can be pinkish. </p>
<p> Incidentally, in Italy, prosciutto crudo refers to raw, salt-cured ham. Cooked ham, which was introduced in the '60s, is called prosciutto cotto—except on pizzeria menus, where it's simply prosciutto and the true prosciutto is called prosciutto crudo. </p>
<p> Salsiccia </p>
<p> Link sausage, made with ground pork, cubed pork fat, spices, and herbs. They are consumed in three different ways. </p>
<p> Raw when fresh, in a sandwich (they have to be very fresh, and one has to be a great fan of raw pork to eat them this way—more of a fan than we usually are). </p>
<p> Cooked when fresh, either as-is on the grill or with the casing removed, as an ingredient in other dishes (for example, try slipping a couple of skinned sausages into the cavity the next time you roast a whole chicken). </p>
<p> Thinly sliced, once they've aged for a couple of months. In this case, they're much like salami and can be a real treat. </p>
<p> Finocchiona </p>
<p> It is a variation on salami that supposedly owes its origins to a thief at a fair near the town of Prato, who stole a fresh salami and hid it in a stand of wild fennel. When he returned for it, he discovered it had absorbed the aromas of its hiding place and had become fit for the Gods. There are two kinds of finocchiona. </p>
<p> One is called finocchiona, and is made of finely ground pork and fat, laced with fennel, and aged for a while; it's fairly firm. </p>
<p> The other is called sbriciolona, a word that means crumbly, and though the mixture is the same, it's much fresher—so fresh that it simply crumbles unless sliced about a half-inch thick. A good sbriciolona is an amazing treat, especially on a slice of schiacciata (A Tuscan flatbread similar to focaccia). </p>
<p> Pancetta </p>
<p> Also known as rigatino (little lined one) and carnesecca (dried meat), this is made from the same cut used to make bacon. However, it's not smoked (actually now it is available in two varieties: dolce [sweet] and affumicata [smoked]), and there's no sugar involved. Just garlic, salt, and spices, in particular, a liberal dose of freshly ground pepper. It's almost always used as an ingredient in other dishes, sometimes providing flavor, and other times taking a commanding role, for example, pasta alla carbonara or a rich pasta all'arrabbiata. Pancetta can also be sold rolled and tied, at which point it's called pancetta arrotolata. </p>
<p> Capocollo </p>
<p> Also known as coppa, this is cured shoulder butt. Again raw, and prepared with salt, herbs, and spices. </p>
<p> Lardo </p>
<p> The word translates as lard, and that's what this is, thick fat with some thin streaks of red meat, cured with herbs, pepper, and salt. The best-known Italian lard is from a town called Colonnata, which is perched on a ridge between two marble quarries in the Apuans above Carrara. There it is aged in slabs of white Carrara marble. </p>
<p> Lardo can be used as a flavoring ingredient in other dishes (in small chunks, or thinly sliced and wrapped around the other cut of meat), but if it's very good, it's divine served as-is, sliced paper-thin and served on toasted bread. If your cholesterol count can take it, this is one of the finest antipasti there is. </p>
<p> Rendered lard that's used for cooking, as a grease, is called strutto. </p>
<p> Soppressata </p>
<p> In Tuscany, soppressata sausage made primarily from leftover pork cuttings—cartilage, snippets of meat, and so on, which are stuffed into the skin of the animal and cooked. Therefore, in appearance, it somewhat resembles a porchetta, the roast pork done whole over a spit. However, the taste is quite different and rather particular; people make sure their guests like it before offering it. </p>
<p> Trichinosis, you wonder? It's virtually unknown in Italy. The salt and the aging process, we've been told, takes care of the parasites. In terms of times, you should age your meats, except for sausage, for at least 40 days, and with many, for example, prosciutto, the seasoning times will be much longer. People commonly age their prosciutto for up to a year, either hanging them up in a cool well-ventilated place or under hardwood ash. </p>
<p> WHAT WILL YOU NEED TO MAKE COLD CUTS AT HOME? </p>
<p> The meat, which should be top quality lean pork, if possible from an animal that was raised organically. </p>
<p> Pork fat. Again, top quality and quite fresh. </p>
<p> Garlic. </p>
<p> Salt. We'd go with sea salt. In Italy, it's called Sale Marino and is sold in coarse and fine grinds. Non-marine salt will work so long as it's pure salt, without additives. The fine grind will likely be better in fillings; when you're salting a cut from the outside either will work though I might go with a fine grind. </p>
<p> How much salt? Norcini (experts in curing pork) We have talked to say to use 2.5-2.8% by weight when making salami or other cold cuts that should go into casings. So if you have 100 pounds of salami mix, you will need 2.5 pounds of salt. For sausages that will be boiled, for example, cotechino, they increase the salt to about 3%, again by weight. Without boiling 3% would make the meat too salty, they say, while with less than 2% the meat can spoil. </p>
<p> Spices, which can include whole peppercorns, nutmeg, fennel seeds, cinnamon, and cloves, depending on the recipes. </p>
<p> A meat grinder. The crank-operated kind will work fine, though you will want a motorized grinder if you're working with larger volumes. </p>
<p> Sausage casings. According to Cassandra Vivian, casings are sold packed in salt, and an open package will keep for a year or more so long as they're covered in salt. To use them, she says to rinse them well and soak them for 5 minutes. A word on the stuffing process: pack the stuffing down firmly. While you don't want to overpack and split a casing, you don't want any air spaces to remain either, because if an air pocket remains, it will be a site for spoilage. </p>
<p> A pricker (what is called a pettinino in Tuscany—a disk with many slender nails sticking up from it, used to puncture the casing after it's stuffed. </p>
<p> Curing Meat Warning </p>
<p> Curing meat requires specific expertise and failure to cure meat properly may result in sickness or death. If you have no experience in this area, we advise you to consult an expert to teach you proper techniques and applications. </p>
<p> Great Resources on Curing Meat </p>
<p> Since curing meat requires such a specific skill set, otherwise, it can lead to illness or worse, we highly recommend consulting with an expert to teach you proper techniques. We found that the following four publications are super helpful guides and go in-depth about just such processes, procedures, and techniques: </p>

<p> Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner </p>
<p> This Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner is the ultimate easy meal recipe for a quick weeknight dinner! It’s bursting with delicious Italian flavours and it’s on your dinner table in 30-minutes or less with hardly any clean-up! </p>
<p> NEVER MISS A POST! FOLLOW ME ON: </p>
<p> There’s pretty much nothing I don’t love about sheet pan dinners like this Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner. For me, they’re kind of like a modern-day casserole, minus the cream-of-whatever soup and all the headache. And really, who wouldn’t love a pan full of fresh veggies and delicious sausage over a casserole anyway? If my family would let me, I’d make meals like this one every single day! </p>
<p> Being a work-at-home mom of two young kids keeps me really busy throughout the day and believe it or not, even this food blogger forgets to make dinner sometimes until about half an hour before we need to sit down to eat. I know, that’s just crazy, but I’m convinced it happens to everyone – even food bloggers – which is why easy meals like this one are SO important to pull out of your hat on a night when there’s nothing on the dinner menu and you have hungry tummies to feed. </p>
<p> We moved recently, so my life has been a little bit crazy (read: total chaos) and I’ve been relying on one-pan meals like this Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner almost every day. In the last year or so I’ve actually been including several one-pan meals on our meal plan every week and I’ve started to keep my pantry and freezer stocked with all the ingredients I need to throw a healthy meal like this together in a pinch. The truth is, as much as I adore cooking, sometimes I just don’t have time for it at the end of a busy day and take-out or some other unhealthy meal is just not an option I’m happy with. </p>
<p> The other thing about many easy, one-pan meals is, they’re usually not that healthy for you and there’s not a lot of colour going on (read: not much nutrition!). This Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner incorporates tons of fresh veggies which is an absolute must in my book when it comes to easy meals. And it’s so versatile, so feel free to add any other veggies your family loves. Sweet potatoes would taste great here, and even carrots would be delicious. My kids adore bell peppers so I’m always looking for ways to include them in my cooking, and they’re definitely a hit in this recipe! I hope your family loves this meal as much as ours does! </p>
<p> For easy recipes like this, my go-to kitchen tools are my favourite meat thermometer and my Misto Oil sprayer. The meat thermometer ensures whatever meat you’re using in your sheet pan dinner is cooked thoroughly and the Misto Oil Sprayer is the perfect healthy and economical substitute for conventional oil sprays you find at the grocery store that often contain all kinds of harmful propellants. </p>
<p> I just love this Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner, both because of how easy it is but also because it’s just so colourful and flavourful! </p>
<p> I hope you like this recipe!! Let me know in the comments below, what’s your favourite super easy meal for busy weeknights?? </p>
<p> Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner </p>
<p> This Italian Sausage Sheet Pan Dinner is the ultimate easy meal recipe for a quick weeknight dinner! It's bursting with delicious Italian flavours and it's on your dinner table in 30-minutes or less with hardly any clean-up! </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and spray a large baking sheet with some cooking spray. </p>
<p> Add the sausages, red onion chunks, baby potatoes, bell pepper chunks, and zucchini slices to the greased baking sheet. Sprinkle the smoked paprika, the oregano and the salt and pepper over everything and toss well. </p>
<p> Arrange the sausages evenly on the baking sheet and nestle them into the vegetables. </p>
<p> Roast everything at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20-25 minutes, or until the sausages are cooked through completely and the baby potatoes are soft. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the sausages have reached an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>
<p> Garnish with some fresh cilantro or parsley and serve this meal to your hungry family! </p>
<p> Comments </p>
<p> Did hey potatoes need to go in first seems like they would be hard still and if you out the sausage in for more the 25 it would be dry? </p>
<p> Because this recipe calls for baby potatoes (which are really small) they actually soften quite quickly. If you use full sized large Italian sausages then the cooking time is just perfect for everything. If you only have full sized potatoes, just cut them into 1-inch sized pieces and you’ll be good to go! </p>
<p> I’m so glad you loved the recipe! Thanks so much for taking the time to leave a comment! 🙂 </p>
<p> I dont have a all the spices listed but cook alot with thyme so hoping that it works well </p>

<p> Italian Square Meatballs </p>
<p> "No-mess meatballs! Just pat the meat mixture into a pan and bake… This is a fantastic way to prepare meatballs as I hate mauling the hamburger to make them round balls (less handling of the meat). You can also put your own spin on this by adding the spices you prefer." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a 9x12-inch baking dish with aluminum foil, and spray with nonstick cooking spray. </p>
<p> Mix the egg and onion together in a mixing bowl. Add the ketchup and ground beef, then season with pepper, salt, Italian seasoning, and bread crumbs; combine until evenly blended. Place the mixture into the prepared pan, and pat into an 8-inch square. Use a table knife or metal spatula to cut the square into 6 vertical strips, then cut the strips horizontally into 6 pieces each for a total of 36 pieces. Do not separate the pieces, just press through the meat to separate it. </p>
<p> Bake in the preheated oven until the meatballs are no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain off any grease, and separate the meatballs with a knife to serve. </p>
<p> Footnotes </p>
<p> Cook's Note </p>
<p> Freeze the meatballs by separating them into recipe-size portions and placing in freezer containers or resealable freezer plastic bags. Freeze for up to 2 months. To thaw, microwave on Defrost for 4 to 6 minutes or until thawed. </p>

<p> Italian Supermarket Bread </p>
<p> You know that yummy Italian bread you get in the supermarket? The fat, golden, sesame-seed-sprinkled loaf? Yes, you CAN make it at home. Here's how. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a large bowl, stir together all of the dough ingredients till cohesive. Knead the dough for 5 to 8 minutes, until it's smooth and supple, adding more water or flour as needed. </p>
<p> Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 1 hour, or until it's doubled in bulk. </p>
<p> Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface and divide it into two pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth 16" log. Place the logs into the two wells of a lightly greased Italian bread pan, cover, and let the loaves rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. </p>
<p> Brush the loaves with the egg wash (or spray them with Quick Shine), then sprinkle heavily with sesame seeds. Slash the loaves diagonally, making 3 slashes in each, and immediately put them in the oven. Bake in a preheated 400°F oven for about 25 minutes, until the loaves are golden brown. For the crispiest crust, turn off the oven, prop the door open, and allow the bread to cool in the oven </p>
<p> Tips from our Bakers </p>
<p> Tips for using your Italian bread pan: Before using for the first time, wash your new pan in hot, soapy water; rinse and dry. To clean after use, place the cooled pan in the dishwasher, or wash by hand using a non-abrasive pad in hot, soapy water. Rinse and dry completely. Scouring with metal pads, steel wool or abrasive cleaners will damage the pan's surface. This pan will gradually darken with use over time. This is normal, and will enhance the quality of the products you bake in it. </p>
<p> To bake the loaves without a pan, shape, and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving enough room between them for expansion. Continue with the recipe as directed. </p>

<p> How Italian Traditions Work </p>
<p> Traditional Italian Food </p>
<p> We can't discuss Italian traditions without talking about food. It's an essential part of Italian life, and may be the one Italian tradition that non-Italians know best. The most well-known Italian dishes are pasta and pizza, but Italian cuisine varies tremendously from one region to another. The popular Italian-American dishes generally hail from the southern region of Campania and the island of Sicily, just off the southern coast. Indeed, most Italians will tell you that Italy isn't a monoculture, and Italians are often as proud of their regional heritage as they are of their nation as a whole. </p>
<p> Italian cuisine is based on peasant traditions and thus relies on inexpensive, locally available foods to a great extent. The Italian populace has historically been quite poor and had to rely on locally available foods to create their recipes [source: Primerano]. This is why many Italian dishes are based on simple ingredients like cheese, pasta, eggplant, olives and olive oil, as well as other items that Italians could make themselves or procure inexpensively. Generally speaking, Italian cuisine is all about using quality ingredients well, rather than cooking technique. (Contrast this with French cuisine, which heavily emphasizes technique.) </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Regional cuisines are affected by climate, geography and history. For example, Slavic dishes and sausages are popular in the northeastern region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, which was partially held by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. The food of Tuscany reflects a history of peasant fare; the area is famous for minestrone, essentially a soup made from leftovers and inexpensive vegetables. Many parts of Italy have sea coasts, so seafood is a much more important part of Italian cooking traditions than most people realize. Sardinia and Sicily are regions known for using lobster, swordfish, cod, sardines and cuttlefish in recipes. </p>
<p> Family plays a central role in Italian traditions, and a large family meal is customary in Italian households. The meals are relaxed affairs with several courses (in which we'll talk about in detail when we talk about special events). The goal of the meal isn't just to eat -- it's time for the family members to converse and enjoy each other's company, and may take hours. </p>
<p> Because the climate is perfect for growing grapes, Italy is famous for its wine. Italy and France are the leading wine-producing nations in the world [source: Wine Institute]. Like Italian food, Italian wines vary by region, and they are known for going perfectly with Italian meals. </p>
<p> Next, we'll discuss the influence of Catholicism on Italian traditions. </p>

<p> Did you know that in Brazil its bad luck to let your wallet or purse hit the floor, as it means you’ll lose money? Or that in France it’s actually good luck to step in dog poop with your left foot? </p>
<p> Like many countries, Italy has its fair share of wacky traditions and superstitions. In fact, Italy is said to be one of the most superstitious countries in the world. </p>
<p> Below, we explore the 15 strangest Italian traditions and superstitions. Review this list before traveling to Italy to make sure that your trip isn’t cursed by Malocchio or the evil eye. </p>
<p> After all, you don’t want to take any chances! </p>
<p> 1. Don’t take a bath when you’re sick </p>
<p> When you’re feeling under the weather, chances are you want to take a nice hot bath to soothe your pain. According to Italian traditions, however, taking a bath when you’re sick will only make you sicker as will going outside with wet hair. </p>
<p> 2. The unlucky number 17 </p>
<p> Have you ever wondered why some hotels in Italy don’t have a 17th floor? It’s because the number is considered unlucky. The Roman numeral for 17 is XVII, but when rearranged to look like VIXI it means “I have lived,” a symbol that’s placed on ancient tombstones and associated with death. </p>
<p> 3. Don’t place a loaf of bread up-side-down </p>
<p> According to Italian traditions, a loaf of bread must always be placed facing up. This superstition is based on the religious fact that bread is considered a symbol of life, therefore, its bad luck to turn the bread up-side-down or stick a knife into it. </p>
<p> 4. Watch where you lay your hat </p>
<p> After a long day of sightseeing you might be tempted to toss your hat onto your bed—don’t! Putting a hat on a bed is considered unlucky because it’s associated with death. According to tradition, when priests visited the dying to give them their last rights, they would remove their hat and put it on the bed. </p>
<p> 5. Never seat 13 people at a dinner table </p>
<p> If you find yourself sitting at a dinner table with 12 other people, then consider yourself unlucky. Having 13 people around the table at mealtime is considered bad luck, as there were 13 people at the Last Supper. </p>
<p> 6. Single people, avoid brooms </p>
<p> If you’re single and you see someone sweeping the floor, make a run for it. If someone brushes over your feet by accident, then you’re destined to be single for the rest of your life. </p>
<p> 7. Don’t toast to bad luck </p>
<p> When it comes to toasting, there are several things that can cause you to have bad luck. For example, never raise a glass that’s full of water and don’t cross arms with the person next to you when you clink glasses. </p>
<p> 8. Stay clear of air conditioners </p>
<p> Wonder why there are no air conditioners in Italy? Italians believe that these evil contraptions blow dangerously cold air in your face, leading to “colpo d’ari” or a “punch of air.” </p>
<p> 9. Touch iron to avoid back luck </p>
<p> In the U.S., people will knock on wood to avoid tempting fate. In Italy, it’s common for people to “tocca ferro” or “touch iron.” We just hope they aren’t touching a hot iron. </p>
<p> 10. Bless a new home </p>
<p> It’s common for people moving into a new home-especially newlyweds–to rid evil spirits and bless their home by performing certain rituals, such as sprinkling salt in the corners of all the rooms. </p>
<p> 11. Eat plenty of lentils on New Year’s Eve </p>
<p> Every culture has it’s own set of New Year’s traditions. According to Italian traditions, it’s customary to eat lentils after the clock strikes 12:00. Also, don’t forget to wear red undergarments, as this too will bring you luck in the coming year. </p>
<p> 12. Beware of a black cat crossing your path </p>
<p> If a cat is crossing the street, don’t be the first one to cross it’s path, as you’ll have bad luck. It’s believed that black cats are a symbol of witchcraft and the devil. We, however, think they are super cute! </p>
<p> 13. Carry a cornicello charm </p>
<p> If you want to protect yourself against the evil-eye, carry a corincello charm around with you at all times. The charm, which resembles a chili pepper or a small horn, represents the horns of the Old European Moon Goddess and will bring you luck. </p>
<p> 14. Don’t place objects in the shape of a cross </p>
<p> Never cross objects in the shape of a cross–for example, your fork and knife–as this is considered to be an insult to the religious symbol of the cross and will bring you bad luck. </p>
<p> 15. Don’t spill the salt </p>
<p> This superstition–which states that one must toss a handful of salt over their left shoulder to get rid of bad luck–is also common in the U.S. In Italy, it’s also customary when passing the salt to place it on the table first before handing it over. </p>
<p> This is just a sample of the many unique Italian traditions and superstitions. In addition to learning Italian, familiarize yourself with these “wives tales” before your trip to avoid getting into any trouble. </p>

<p> These are not traditions. These are superstition. You are offering no explanation. The salt one for example is very simple. Salt was extremely expensive in the inner part of Italy. Throwing it on the floor or on the table was unlucky because you had to buy it again. The bread one is not precise. In the ancient times and some bakers to do, bakers will cut across on top of the bread to facilitate levitation , and also to bless the bread so to say. Putting the bread upside down was disrespectful for the cross not the bread. However these superstitions were probably through 50 years ago certainly not now. Most people have air conditioning, a lot of people have black cats, and by the way hotels rarely go over the 5th or 7th floor we certainly don’t have 20 stories hotels, here unless maybe in Milan or Rome. Even in those cases, I can guarantee you, that there is a level 17. These were superstition of maybe 50 years ago, the world has moved on, do should you. </p>
<p> What does it mean when they say in italian “ari facce”? I heard it means “once again” but I don’t get the point of how the translation works out. If someone knows please? </p>

<p> 14 Italian wedding traditions you may not know about </p>
<p> There are many traditions and superstitions that exist within Italian weddings that you mightn’t even be aware of. Here’s a brief overview of the Italian wedding traditions you may not already know about. </p>
<p> Wedding date </p>
<p> Italian weddings are rarely held on Fridays, as this is viewed as the day evil spirits are created – and this will only bring you bad luck. The preferable day is Sunday – which is viewed as the luckiest day to marry, and signifies fertility and prosperity. </p>
<p> Good luck at the ceremony </p>
<p> In many Italian weddings, both the bride and the groom will do all they can to bring as much good luck to the wedding as possible. For the groom, this means carrying a small piece of iron in his pocket to ward off evil spirits. For the bride, she will make a small rip in her veil to welcome good luck. </p>
<p> First look </p>
<p> In many Italian regions, the bride is not allowed to see herself in the mirror before the wedding. She can take a peek however, if she first removes a glove or shoe. </p>
<p> The dress </p>
<p> Even if the bride herself isn’t wearing a white wedding dress, all guests should avoid wearing white to another’s wedding. </p>
<p> The bouquet </p>
<p> As the final gift to his girlfriend before she becomes his wife, the groom is expected to pay for the bridal bouquet. Although she can choose the floral arrangement to suit her theme and aesthetic, the groom must pay for it and see that it is delivered to her on the wedding day. </p>
<p> After the ceremony </p>
<p> After the ceremony, as the newlyweds are departing the Church, rice is showered on them by their guests to symbolise fertility. Then, all guests are given the chance to approach and personally congratulate the newlyweds on their new marriage. </p>
<p> Happy years ahead </p>
<p> In some regions, the newlyweds would break glass vase, and the number of broken fragments symbolise how many happy years of marriage the newlyweds have ahead of them. </p>
<p> Drinks </p>
<p> Wine is the traditional drink at Italian weddings. </p>
<p> Bomboniere </p>
<p> ‘Bomboniere’ is the Italian word for wedding favours. It refers to the gift given to guests to thank them for their attendance at the wedding. Bomboniere usually contains a present, confetti (sugared almonds), and printed ribbons. The number of confetti included in the bomboniere is important – it should be an odd number, preferably five or seven for good luck. </p>
<p> Garter </p>
<p> In Italian weddings, the groom removes the garter from his bride’s leg and throws it to the wedding guests. If the bride is not wearing a garter, her right shoe is thrown instead. </p>
<p> Groom’s tie </p>
<p> At the reception, the groom’s tie is cut into many tiny pieces and offered up for sale to the wedding guests by his groomsmen. The money collected is then used to contribute to the couple’s wedding expenses. </p>
<p> Guests’ money contributions </p>
<p> As Italian tradition, brides carry a satin bag at the reception for guests to place envelopes of money in. Some brides wear it around their neck so male guests can drop in money in exchange for a dance. </p>
<p> First dance </p>
<p> During the couple’s first dance, it is tradition for guests to hold colourful streamers attached to the bride and groom’s hands as they waltz, and to wrap them up in streamers, well wishes, and love as they dance. </p>
<p> General dancing </p>
<p> “La Tarantella” (the tarantula) is the dance guests perform to wish the newly married couple good luck. Guests hold hands and rotate clockwise as the music speeds up, and then they reverse directions. </p>

<p> Italian Weddings Part 2: Italian Wedding Traditions </p>
<p> Getting married in Italy is likely a dream come true! So why not incorporate some Italian wedding traditions to complete your destination wedding? Adding a touch of Italy is a great way to personalize your big day. Bring you and your guests fully into the Italian culture by adding some or all of these great Italian wedding traditions. </p>
<p> Some traditions cross cultures. Photo by John Hope </p>
<p> The Engagement </p>
<p> While today white is the color of choice for the bride, it wasn’t always this way. For example, in Tuscany brides would traditionally wear a black gown with a white hat or veil, and in Venice a bride would walk to the church in her second-best gown, saving her nicest bridal gown for the ceremony. </p>
<p> Even the bridal veil dates back to ancient Rome. To prevent the bride and groom from seeing each other before they married, whether to ensure that an arranged marriage was followed through with or to preserve purity, the bride’s face would be covered by a long white veil, the white representing purity. </p>
<p> The night before the wedding the bride sleeps at her parents’ house. In the past she wore green to bring good luck and fertility. On this night it’s tradition for the groom to deliver flowers to his fiancée. These flowers once served as the bride’s wedding bouquet and represented the last gift she receives as a ‘single’ person. </p>
<p> Today a bride can choose her bouquet, but it’s still tradition that the groom pays and ensures that it is delivered to his bride. Though many of the Italian wedding traditions are less followed today with couples choosing more modern weddings, others have been adapted in different ways by each couple. </p>
<p> Be careful! If you’re following the Italian wedding traditions guests will likely shower you with rice after your ceremony. Photo by Sandrino (flickr) </p>
<p> The Wedding </p>
<p> Traditionally, Sunday was considered the only day for a wedding. A holy day, it ensured a lifetime of happiness, while any other day was considered unlucky. Though today this is no longer considered true – Saturday is a very popular choice – Sunday is still a top choice for couples getting married in Italy, even if a wedding party might continue until Monday morning! </p>
<p> A bride and groom have their testimoni, or witnesses. Unlike in American weddings, the witnesses aren’t expected to dress alike and there is often only one or two bridesmaids and one or two groomsmen. </p>
<p> The day of the wedding the guests (and sometimes even the groom!) wait outside of the church for the bride to arrive. The bride, for her part, will likely arrive late, while the groomsmen tease the groom that she has changed her mind. In some parts of Italy it was a tradition for the groom to carry a small piece of iron (toc ferro) in his pocket to ward off evil spirits and bad luck – like his bride changing her mind! </p>
<p> In some regions the couple break a vase and the number of pieces represent each year of happiness they’ll have together. This particular tradition was seen in the film “When in Rome” with Josh Duhamel and Kristen Bell. </p>
<p> After the wedding the guests file out of the church to welcome the bride and groom. Still today it’s customary to throw rice at the couple as they exit the church to symbolize a shower of fertility. </p>
<p> The Reception </p>
<p> One of the many bonuses of getting married in Italy? Your reception might have a backdrop like this! Photo by John Hope </p>
<p> As with most Italian celebrations, the Italian wedding is completely centered around food and guests can be sure to leave filled to the brim! It’s customary for the bridal party to wait before arriving at the reception hall, giving them time to refresh and relax before being introduced as newlyweds. Guests are usually offered an aperitivo with appetizers and drinks while they wait for the bride and groom to arrive. </p>
<p> Don’t fill up on appetizers though – the main course is likely a primo and secondo, and some even have more than one of each! In Sicily a “Venetian Hour” is still a common tradition. This is a huge dessert table with a variety of pastries, cakes and other desserts available throughout the entire reception. </p>
<p> Though today not all regions of Italy dance at their wedding, many still do. In the south the Tarantella, a traditional wedding dance, is still an integral part of the celebration and throughout Italy it’s common for guests to sing traditional wedding songs to the new couple about love, relationships and, of course, the wedding night. </p>
<p> Similar to some U.S. wedding celebrations, the bride might carry a small bag or borsa for le buste or envelopes filled with money from the guests. She might even dance with her guests in exchange. </p>
<p> One tradition that holds strong is confetti. Not small pieces of paper but white candy-coated almonds. The confetti can be a variety of flavors such as cognac or pistacchio, but they are meant to represent both the sweet and bitter parts of life and marriage – an edible reminder of “for better or worse.” They’re often presented to guests as a wedding favor and, as a marriage is of two people, the amount eaten can’t be divisible by two, so be sure to eat only an odd number of the candied almonds – five or seven is a good bet! </p>
<p> Guests will wish the newlyweds good luck with “Evviva gli sposi!” meaning hurray for the newlyweds or “Per cent’anni!” wishing a wedding that lasts 100 years. In any case the couple will likely be kissing often throughout the night as guests clink their champagne glasses with cries of “un bacio per la sposa!” </p>
<p> In some regions of Italy, the traditions will feel very special – like leaving the ceremony on a boat in Venice! Photo by Luca Fazzolari </p>
<p> Whether you chose to get married in Italy for family, the beautiful location or a long-held dream to visit, adding some Italian wedding traditions is a great way to incorporate the location into your big day! A wedding is a celebration and the Italians surely know how to celebrate. And just think, if it rains that too is considered good luck in Italy and a symbol of a happy marriage, ensuring that nothing comes in the way of your big day! </p>

<p> One of my six granddaughters got married May of 2014, and she followed traditional Italian when she had favors for the guests by giving them a present of white candy colored almonds. They thought it was a great idea. Her theme birds of all kinds, especially doves and love birds. Therefore she gave out a birds nest with four almonds. Wishing them luck and at least four children. I was so proud to think that she would do that in honor of me her Grandma. </p>
<p> Most of the time i seen so many Veg & Non- Veg courses for child’s, special guest and senior Citizens. White single layer sponge cake served to everyone after lunch. Sunday was considered as holly day which is luck for couple married life. </p>

<p> The Italian Wedding Traditions You Didn't Know About </p>
<p> Whether church service or civil ceremony, weddings in the bel paese often include many recognisable elements – a white dress, tossing of the bouquet and the first dance, for example. But what else does a traditional ceremony involve? Find out with this list of Italian wedding customs you didn’t already know about. </p>
<p> La Serenata </p>
<p> La serenata has fallen out of fashion these days, but it’s still occasionally practiced among theatrically minded couples. It takes place the night before the wedding and involves the groom serenading the bride from outside her window in celebration of their impending union. Sometimes the bride will lower down a basket of gifts such as prosciutto, bread and cheese – symbolising her acceptance of the proposal. </p>
<p> The Rings </p>
<p> As the bride and groom’s closest and most trusted friends, the wedding witnesses traditionally buy the rings. This custom is less common these days, but the best man will sometimes still opt to make this grand gesture. </p>
<p> Confetti </p>
<p> In Italy, confetti are not the thousands of coloured paper squares showered over the happy couple upon leaving the church but instead sugarcoated almonds gift-wrapped in tiny boxes. Confetti are sometimes given in groups of five symbolising health, wealth, happiness, fertility and long life but should always be given in an odd number to ensure good luck. </p>
<p> Bomboniere </p>
<p> The confetti form part of the bomboniere, or wedding favours, given to the guests as a thank you for attendance. Bomboniere are also given at other special occasions, such as baptisms or communions, and include token gifts such as mini bottles of liqueur, chocolates, olive oil, or pots of jam and honey. </p>
<p> The Dress </p>
<p> As well as the groom not seeing the bride before the service, in Italy the bride shouldn’t see herself on her wedding day. If she does want to look in a mirror she’ll need to remove an earring, a shoe or a glove first. Not following this superstition could bring untold bad luck to the marriage. </p>
<p> The Bouquet </p>
<p> As one final gift to his betrothed before they tie the knot, the groom must buy the bride’s bouquet. She can pick out her preferred arrangement if she wants, but it’s down to the groom to pay the bill and organise delivery. In the north it’s also customary for the groom to wait outside the church and hand the bouquet to the bride as they enter together. </p>
<p> The Garter </p>
<p> As with many weddings, Italian brides wear a garter for luck. This dates back to a 14th-century tradition in which the bride would remove the garter after the ceremony and give little pieces of it to guests as a memento of the day. In some regions, particularly in the south, it’s customary for the groom to remove the garter and throw it into the crowd. If the bride happens to be lacking a garter, she loses her right shoe instead. </p>
<p> The Tie </p>
<p> Thankfully, it’s not just the bride who suffers a mandatory wardrobe malfunction. At the reception, the groom’s tie is ceremonially chopped off and cut into pieces. The guests will then offer up cash for the pieces – a gift towards the expense of the big day. </p>
<p> La Borsa </p>
<p> The cold hard cash doesn’t stop there, either, as brides carry a satin bag in which guests can drop in envelopes of money. Some brides wear it around their neck for male guests to deposit cash in exchange for a dance. </p>
<p> The Day </p>
<p> Custom has it that Sunday is the best day to get hitched, and couples that marry on the Sabbath will enjoy luck, fertility and prosperity throughout their marriage. Traditionalists should avoid Fridays, which are thought to be the day evil spirits were created. </p>

<p> You could often attend an Italian wedding if you live in Melbourne. Being aware or not, there are actually more than 1 million people in Australia claimed they have Italian heritage. </p>
<p> Traditional Italian weddings are a delight to watch as every custom and ritual practised signifies the fact that Italians value marriage and marital relationship. Italians are known for their warmth and hospitality, which gets reflected in their wedding festivities, as they make everyone feel a part of the ceremony. The charm of Italian weddings lies in the seamless blend of traditional and modern elements which create a magical experience for the couple, family members, and guests. </p>
<p> Whether the wedding is kept as a low-key affair or an extravagant affair, the traditions and customs are followed whole-heartedly by both couple and wedding attendees. Italians living outside their home country stay true to their roots by incorporating Italian wedding traditions in their wedding festivities. </p>
<p> Let’s have a look at how Traditional Italian Weddings are held by Italians living in Melbourne and other parts of Australia. </p>
<p> 1. The Bridal Bouquet </p>
<p> Considered as a final gift from the groom to his girlfriend before she becomes his bride, the bridal bouquet is a long-standing tradition practised in all Italian weddings. On the morning of the wedding day, the groom gets the bouquet delivered to her bride or gives it to her outside the ceremony venue. The floral arrangement and colour of the bouquet is usually a surprise for the bride, but in some cases, the bride can choose the design and colour. As per the Italian wedding traditions, the groom should pay for the bouquet. </p>
<p> 2. The Wedding Dress </p>
<p> Unlike brides in other cultures, the Italian brides can choose colours other than white for her wedding dress. So, if you attend an Italian wedding and see a bride in a light cream bridal gown, don’t get shocked. One peculiar custom followed in traditional Italian weddings is that guests are forbidden to wear white even if the bride is not wearing this colour. However, guests can wear black even though it is considered as a sign of bad omen in weddings held in other countries. </p>
<p> 3. Ribbon Cutting </p>
<p> When a bride-to-be leaves for the wedding ceremony, a white ribbon is tied over the front door or main gate of her house. In many weddings, the ribbon is not tied but held by two of her friends. The bride-to-be cuts this ribbon to symbolise the abandonment of the house and the beginning of a new journey with her future husband. A ribbon is also tied across the doorway or entrance of the ceremony venue, i.e., the church. The knot of the ribbon symbolises the bond between the bride and groom, and also represents that they are ‘tying the knot’. </p>
<p> 4. Ceremony Venue and Altar </p>
<p> In some traditional Italian weddings, the groom and bride walk to their ceremony venue together to mark the onset of their journey together as a couple. The guests at the wedding wait for the arrival of the bride and groom outside the ceremony venue. Once the couple enters the church, the family members and guests follow them, and the ceremony begins. The mother of the groom escorts him down the aisle while the bride is escorted down the aisle by her father. On reaching the top of the altar, the bride gives one stem from her bridal bouquet to the groom’s mother. </p>
<p> 5. Interactive Ceremony </p>
<p> Contrary to regular church weddings, Italian weddings are quite interactive and exciting. Instead of playing the role of an audience, family members, friends, and guests participate actively in the wedding. Being warm-hearted, Italians great each other with a smile and exchange pleasantries. The attendees even sing prayers with the priest to seek blessings for the newly wedded couple. </p>
<p> 6. Confetti and Auguri </p>
<p> Once the wedding ceremony gets over, all the guests are handed confetti for showering the same on the couple. Traditionally, small bags of rice were given as confetti, but now they are replaced by rose petals in most of the weddings. Some environmentally conscious people use tissue paper confetti. As soon as the bride and groom begin to exit from the church, the guests throw confetti over them and wish them personally. The term ‘Auguri’ which means ‘Congratulations’ can be heard a lot in traditional Italian weddings. </p>
<p> 7. Tie, Garter, and Bouquet </p>
<p> When the reception begins, one of the first customs that take place involves cutting the groom’s tie and the bride’s garter. The groomsmen cut the tie worn by the groom into several tiny pieces and auctions the same to be bought by the wedding guests. The proceeds of the auction are used to pay for the wedding expenses. Similarly, the garter worn by the bride is also torn into pieces and thrown to be collected by the guests but without paying any money. In some regions, the groom removes the garter of the bride and throws it towards the guests. </p>
<p> If the bride hasn’t worn a garter, her right shoe is removed and thrown. The rationale behind the former tradition is that higher the amount collected by selling the pieces of the tie, higher the earnings of the groom in the future. The latter tradition is followed because it is believed that owning a piece of the bridal trousseau proves to be lucky. The bride tosses her bouquet to the single women, who try to catch it with the belief that if they get the bouquet, they will find the love of their life soon. </p>
<p> 8. The First Dance </p>
<p> The First Dance of the newly married couple is one of those Italian wedding traditions that can never fall out of favour. The colourful streamers are attached to the hands of the couple, and when they start dancing, the guests hold those streamers so that the couple gets wrapped up in the same. Entangling the streamers is a symbol of good wishes that guests give to the bride and groom. </p>
<p> Soon, the bridal party and the rest of the guests follow the couple and perform the “La Tarantella” dance. Guests rotate clockwise and then anticlockwise while holding hands. Throwback songs being played during the dance is one of the highlights in many traditional Italian weddings. </p>
<p> 9. Drinks, Food, and Cake </p>
<p> Before the meal, the guests are served sweet alcoholic drink so that they can raise a toast for wishing the couple a happy married life for many years to come. In most of the weddings, wine is a preferable drink. The drinks are served by the groomsmen. Next comes the meal – Italians just love food, and so, you will find a variety of delicious and exquisite dishes being served to the guests. </p>
<p> Unlike weddings held in the UK and the USA, the wedding cake is not central to Italian weddings. The cake is not displayed proudly at reception. One of the most popular cakes in traditional Italian weddings is ‘Millefoglie’, which means ‘a thousand leaves’. Millefoglie is thin and crunchy cake having layers of puff pastry filled with soft vanilla custard. Some couples even opt for millefoglie with chocolate and strawberry flavours. Being influenced by American culture, many couples choose to have elaborate cakes at their wedding. </p>
<p> 10. Gifts and Bomboniere </p>
<p> Gifts and Bomboniere are essential Italian wedding traditions as they signify the affection and respect present between the couple and the guests. The guests are expected to bring gifts which are mostly in the form of cash envelopes. Some guests also give the wedding card to the newly wedded couple. Usually, the bride carries a satin bag in which the guests have to put envelopes. In some weddings, the bride wears the bag around her neck so that male guests can put money in it in exchange for a dance. </p>
<p> Bomboniere or wedding favours are given to the guests as a gesture of gratitude for attending the wedding. Bomboniere contains sugared almonds in an odd number, mostly 5 or 7, as the taste of almonds represent the bittersweet nature of married life and odd numbers represent the indivisible unity. If given in five, the almonds signify happiness, fertility, longevity, health, and wealth for the couple. Bomboniere are kept in a bowl on the table at the end of the wedding dinner. Although Bomboniere are traditionally white, they are made in wedding colours as well in a few weddings. </p>
<p> 11. Photography </p>
<p> Photography is an integral part of the traditional Italian weddings as the couple can relive the memories of their wedding day with the help of photographs captured. Every guest present in the reception gets their picture clicked with the bride and groom. The couple feels excited to be photographed with everyone – from toddlers to the elderly. </p>
<p> Their wedding photographs serve as a medium to strengthen the bond with the guests and make them feel appreciated. We have completed various projects of wedding photography for Italian weddings held in Melbourne and many other cities. We have always enjoyed documenting the weddings of the Italian couples as they make give off positive vibes which make the job of wedding vendors stress-free. </p>
<p> Amidst all the wonderful and unique Italian wedding traditions, Italian weddings have moments which are just unforgettable. Attending an Italian wedding which is conducted by following the traditions and customs is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you ever get a chance to attend a traditional Italian wedding, don’t give it a miss at any cost or else you might miss out on the opportunity of filling your heart with joyous memories. </p>

<p> Italian Wedding Traditions </p>
<p> Traditions are part of the Italian culture, days like Christmas, Easter, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Births and of course Weddings have their own traditions. All countries in the world have a variety of customs and traditions and of course, Italy is not an exception to this. Italian traditions regarding weddings are so intriguing because they vary from region to region, even if the nicest are respected everywhere. Couples wishing to get married in Italy in the tradition of their ancestors or at least introduce elements from their cultural backgrounds. Step by step here follow the most important traditions of a wedding. </p>
<p> Engagement </p>
<p> Nowadays a man proposes to a woman directly giving her a ring with a diamond which is a symbol of the eternity of love, a promise to marry, the first step towards a life together and this promise is then traditionally sealed with a romantic kiss. Engagement rings date back to the medieval ages and are now one of the most common traditions all over the world. From this moment on the couple can be considered officially engaged. </p>
<p> Engagement Party </p>
<p> This is not part of the Italian tradition like in other cultures, what happens is that the couple organizes a meeting with both their families to allow them to know each other if this has not happened before and then announce their wish to share a family life. </p>
<p> Hen and Bachelorette Parties </p>
<p> 'Hen' or bachelorette parties are a recent innovation that started in America in the 1970s. In Italy, these parties are an opportunity to have a nice dinner and fun with friends, even the ones who are not invited to the Wedding. A night out with friends that usually happens one or two weekends before the wedding. </p>
<p> Superstitions Regarding Weddings </p>
<p> An Italian bride spends the night before the wedding at her parent's house. Some wear green because it is said that brings good fortune. The Bride is not supposed to wear any gold on her wedding day apart from her wedding ring, it is considered bad luck. Bride has to wear something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue and something she has received as a gift. </p>
<p> Traditional Italian Style Wedding Dress Code </p>
<p> It is rude for anyone other than the Bride to wear white. Black dresses are becoming more and more popular because considered really elegant especially for an afternoon wedding. </p>
<p> Getting to the Ceremony </p>
<p> The Groom must not see the Bride before the wedding ceremony, he is at the altar with his witness and waits till the Bride steps in, accompanied by her father who will then "give her away". Bride's father shakes the Groom's hand, kisses her daughter and walks back to the first row of benches to take place next to the Bride's mother. This is more common with Catholic weddings, while for a civil wedding Bride and Groom arrive together to the Wedding Hall accompanied by family and friends. In some regions Bride and Groom walk together to the Church, in other regions, the Groom brings the bouquet of flowers to the wedding or even carries a piece of iron in his pocket. </p>
<p> After the Ceremony </p>
<p> Rice is thrown at the couple coming out of the Church or wedding hall to symbolize a shower of fertility. All guests approach and congratulate the newlyweds outside the wedding venue. In some regions in Italy Bride and Groom have to cut a log in two with a double handle saw after the wedding. This symbolizes the couple's partnership in marriage. Another nice tradition is tying a ribbon in front of the church. The ribbon represents the bride and groom 'tying the knot'. </p>
<p> Wedding Reception </p>
<p> Wedding receptions follow the ceremony, guests keep the same dresses. Guests arrive before the wedding couple at the restaurant. The waiters offer them some aperitifs while they wait for the arrival of the spouses from their photo tour. </p>
<p> Many funny moments are organized at an Italian Wedding despite main activity is still eating a lot of delicious and genuine food accompanied by the best wines, limoncello, and liquors. Often during the banquet, guests bang glasses with spoons to encourage the Bride and Groom to kiss several times. </p>
<p> At some weddings, particularly in Northern Italy, the best man cuts the groom's tie into little pieces. The pieces are then put onto a tray and sold to the guests. Bride and Groom go from table to table, greeting and chatting with every guest, so everyone feels welcomed. </p>
<p> At some point friends of the couple sneak away to play tricks in the new couple's house (they put itching powder in the bed, fishes in the bathtub, hide shoes...), others organize practical jokes for the couple. </p>
<p> It is customarily that the Bride throws her bouquet to the single ladies attending the banquet. Whoever catches the bouquet will be the next to get married! </p>
<p> The wedding cake is white (for purity), tiered and topped by figurines representing the bride and groom. </p>
<p> The wedding couple remains till the end of the reception and not only, sometimes the very close friends stay with the couple even after the reception, they go all together for a drink or even accompany them to their new house. </p>
<p> Bomboniere </p>
<p> At the end of the wedding day, just before guests leave, Bride and Groom give small gifts to their guests to say thank you. Italians call them bomboniere, made of a present, confetti (sugared almonds) and printed ribbons. Bomboniere is a symbol of family life. The number of confetti is very important: it should be an odd number - preferably 5 or 7- each a good-luck number. </p>

<p> Keeping Tradition Alive </p>
<p> October 29, 2011 </p>
<p> Story By: Dining Out Team | </p>
<p> Waimalu Chop Suey Chinese Restaurant is Chinese in theory, with an abundance of local flair and a bit of American accents surrounding this iconic establishment. Call it historic, but in its almost 50 years of business in Waimalu Shopping Center, this reputable landmark, also known as the “House of Gau Gee,” is often beset by customers feasting on tasty Northern Chinese cuisine that over the years has become a local favorite. At times the Travel Channel will spark your interest between bites, as it plays on the two recently purchased flat-screen TVs mounted in the restaurant, and friendly staff will often catch up on a story or two with a loyal customer. </p>
<p> Seafood with Vegetables ($10.75) </p>
<p> Salt and Pepper Pork Chops ($9.25) </p>
<p> Crispy Gau Gee (eight pieces, $9.25) </p>
<p> And while times have changed, Waimalu Chop Suey continues to please patrons with the same culinary experience they’ve known and loved, as the menu and some familiar faces remain the same. However, most recently, one may have noticed a particular change that has taken place: a switch in ownership. </p>
<p> At the start of this month, Jacky Wang has taken on the role of president and owner of Waimalu Chop Suey after previous owners Randy Yim, his older brother Dennis and their mother Violet retired after a 49-year run. In fact, Randy’s late father Mun Cho Yim is the mastermind behind the eatery’s famous “bambucha” gau gee. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> “It’s remarkable that one owner was able to stay in business for so long, especially with the downturn of the economy. I hope I can stay here for 50 years as well,” says Wang, who has been in the restaurant industry for the past 15 years, and also currently runs Kin Sing Chinese Fast Food in Waipahu. </p>
<p> Wang, who’s originally from China, set roots in the islands in 1993 with the hope of pursuing a career in sales, but instead quickly obtained a part-time job at a restaurant. With much persistence and dedication, Wang was able to work his way through the ranks from busboy, to server, manager and most recently owner. </p>
<p> “I really enjoy talking to customers, so even though the sales route didn’t work out, I’m still able to do what I love in the restaurant business,” he says. </p>
<p> “I took on the challenge of taking over this restaurant, and this is an exciting, new experience. It’s really important that we respect the previous owner and our customers, and maintain the tradition that has gone on for so long.” </p>
<p> Continuity is key. Glance at the menu and you’ll be overwhelmed with the vast possibilities, but if you’re a longtime customer, you’ll also notice that your favorites are still readily available. Today, head chef Yung Hoy Lee, who has worked in the kitchen for 25 years, is proud to continue to offer the restaurant’s most-requested item. </p>
<p> “Everyone loves the Crispy Gau Gee ($9.25 for eight pieces) and I make 1,000 pieces of gau gee per day,” Lee says with a smile. </p>
<p> The gau gee offered here is quite possibly one of the largest on the island as the crispy outer pi (skin/wrap) is filled with ground pork and hints of vegetables, including cabbage and mushrooms. Customers also can request hot mustard sauce and sweet-sour sauce to pair with this restaurant specialty — and Wang’s favorite indulgence. </p>
<p> “I taste it every day to make sure it’s absolute perfection. I have to make sure it’s at its highest quality — I’m the taste tester,” he says with a laugh. </p>
<p> In addition to the original Crispy Gau Gee, Waimalu Chop Suey also offers Crispy Gau Gee Mein with Vegetables, Crispy Gau Gee with Vegetables, Steamed Gau Gee, Gau Gee Soup and more. </p>
<p> According to Wang, this renowned eatery is now offering an irresistible special in which customers receive a free live Maine lobster with dine-in orders of $50 or more (must present ad found on Page 19). The live Maine lobster can be prepared in various ways — with ginger and green onion, black bean sauce or with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> “The main thing is that we keep the original menu because that’s what customers keep coming back for,” Wang states. “We’ll never take dishes off the menu, but we soon hope to add new items to bring in even more customers. We’re taking things one step at a time. </p>
<p> “Customers rave about our Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp ($11.25), saying the flavor is really tasty.” </p>
<p> Being that there’s something for every palate here, fans of Waimalu Chop Suey are giving great praise to the Live Dungeness Crab (market price), Seafood with Vegetables ($10.75), Steamed Fish Filet with Ginger and Onion Sauce ($11.50), Salt and Pepper Pork Chops ($9.25) and Combo Fried Rice ($8.50), as well — and that’s simply skimming the tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p> For those on the go, ordering takeout is convenient. Planning a party? Waimalu Chop Suey also caters and delivers (delivery is free of charge for orders of $220 and above). </p>
<p> Looking ahead, Wang is optimistic and hopes to preserve the longevity of the restaurant. </p>
<p> “My primary goal is to keep serving high-quality products with great customer service,” he says. “I won’t give up. I’m only looking forward.” </p>

<p> Knife Skills 101 </p>
<p> Learn to Use Your Chef's Knife Like a Pro </p>
<p> Danilo Alfaro has published more than 800 recipes and tutorials focused on making complicated culinary techniques approachable to home cooks. </p>
<p> Knife skills are one of the most important parts of the culinary arts. These articles, tutorials, and how-tos will help you practice your knife skills. </p>
<p> The chef's knife is probably a cook's most important tool. And given the amount of time it spends in your hand, it's definitely worth making sure you have a good one. Here's a quick tutorial on the various parts of a chef's knife, what they do and why they're important. </p>
<p> This tutorial will cover the correct way to hold a chef's knife, and how to grip the food with your other hand to avoid cutting yourself. </p>
<p> Chopping an onion is one of the most common kitchen tasks. This illustrated tutorial shows how to chop an onion the fast, easy and safe way. </p>
<p> Good knife skills help improve the quality of the food you cook by ensuring uniform cooking times and making it look nicer. Check out these illustrated examples of all the basic culinary arts knife cuts. </p>
<p> Want to see examples of all the basic culinary arts knife cuts and shapes? This photo gallery highlights nine common culinary knife cuts including the bonnet, allumette, julienne and more. </p>
<p> The word batonnet, (pronounced: bah-tow-NAY) is a basic knife cut measuring 1/2 inch × 1/2 inch × 2 1/2 to 3 inches. This long and thin cut also forms the starting point for the dice cuts. For example, to make the medium dice you'd start with the batonnet and just trim down into cubes. </p>
<p> The word allumette is French for "matchstick," and these slender knife cuts are perfect for lending a touch of elegance to soups, salads, and other vegetable preparations. </p>
<p> Similar to how the batonnet is used to create medium diced cubes, these long and thin cuts also form the starting point for the dice cuts. For example, to make the small dice, you'd start with the allumette and just trim it down into cubes. </p>
<p> Keeping your chef's knife sharp will make your job in the kitchen easier — and safer, too. That's because when you're using a dull knife you have to apply more pressure than you would with a sharper blade, making the knife more likely to slip. </p>
<p> Learning how to sharpen your knife with a whetstone may take a bit of practice, but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to keep knives razor sharp and save time and money. Also, check out this video on using a whetstone. </p>
<p> Using a knife steel, also called a sharpening steel or honing steel, helps align the knife's edge so that it cuts smoothly and easily. </p>

<p> Lamb Chops Scottadito </p>
<p> In Italian the word scottadito means burned fingers. This dish is named scottadito because the lamb chops are so delicious that you can’t resist eating them sizzling hot, straight from the grill and burning your fingers. </p>
<p> Lamb Chops Scottadito Recipe </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil </p>
<p> salt and pepper to taste </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a small bowl stir together the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, salt and pepper. Place the lamb chops in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, turn the cops to coat both sides. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. </p>
<p> Start a fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill. Place the chops on the rack over high heat and grill turning once, 5 minutes per side for medium rare. The outside will be well seared with the insides still pink. </p>

<p> These lamb chops look like they’re worth a burned finger or two! Very simple flavours, but that’s exactly how it ought to be to let the lamb shine. Must try these before grilling season is over. </p>
<p> Great recipe – I quite like the etymology of scottadito! Certainly, I would burn myself trying to get ahold of one of these. </p>
<p> In Treviso, where I come from, they’re called scottadeo, which is dialect for scottadito! </p>
<p> Wow, these look simply AMAZING, do they taste as good as your picture makes them appear? i’m seriously salivating at the mouth now, lol </p>
<p> These chops look and sound delicious.Who cares about burnt fingers when something tastes great-bet they work on a bbq as well! </p>
<p> 5 minutes a side would destroy these lamb chops. Seriously, or you may need to work on your fire making skills. I had these last night and it was 3 minutes a side maximum. I like the recipe however. </p>
<p> Younger lambs are smaller and more tender. Mutton is meat from a sheep over two years old, and has less tender flesh. In general, the darker the colour, the older the animal. Baby lamb meat will be pale pink, while regular lamb is pinkish-red.`””. </p>
<p> Nice recipe, we use a slight variation here, we are in the Southwest in the middle of the Navajo Res and Lamb and Mutton is cooked all the time, also to a response to the end of grilling time, I grill when it is freezing out, if I could I would grill pancakes. Good Recipe. </p>
<p> Someone I work using sessions your blog in many cases along with advisable the item to me to learn in addition. The actual writing style is definitely excellent and the submissions are useful. Information information you provide the visitors! </p>
<p> I like your site and content. thanks for sharing the information keep updating, looking forward for more posts. Thanks </p>
<p> This dish looks like a celebration…What a gorgeous abbacchio!!! I wish my fork would reach that plate. </p>
<p> Well, this takes me back! Lamb ribs chops have to be the most delicious meat of all. They really cry out for a simple treatment like this. I sometimes make scottadito with lard instead of olive oil, makes for a really savory result. </p>
<p> I probably cook lamb chops this way more than any other. I had a lovely cast iron ridged grill pan that went and cracked on me a year or two ago…. I have a replacement but it is a lighter metal. Still does a pretty great job though 🙂 For this please visit http://www.messob.com/ </p>
<p> Wow, we cannot get this beautiful of lamb chops where we live… and we are living in one of the most cosmopolitan area in the world! This dish looks absolutely marvelous! </p>
<p> I have found so many interesting thing in your blog and I really love that. Keep up the good work! </p>

<p> You don't need a recipe to roast pork chops to their tender, juicy best. A little olive oil, a 350 F oven and around 20 minutes of cooking time give you the prized golden-brown crust and rich flavor that make pork chops a quick and hearty go-to dish fit for any night of the week. </p>
<p> Oven Cooking Times </p>
<p> Cooking times always vary based on a number of individual factors, especially when baking or roasting in the oven. The oven temperature affects cooking time, plus oven temperatures aren't precise and fluctuate, so each oven cooks at its own pace to some degree. With repeated use, you'll get a feel for whether your model tends to require shorter or longer cooking times. The thickness of your pork chops also affects cooking time; the thinner the cut, the quicker it cooks through. Also, bone-in cuts tend to cook faster than boneless ones. The amount of food you're cooking at the same time, the material and color of the baking tray and other particulars influence cooking time, too. </p>
<p> Approximations </p>
<p> Of course, you need a good idea of how long your pork chops will be in the oven so you can plan the rest of your cooking and meal prep. While cooking times always vary, it's not difficult to come up with a decent estimate of how long the meat stays in the oven. To use the simplest method, bake your pork chops at 350 F on a shallow, uncovered roasting pan. Using this method, expect bone-in pork chops to require about 20 minutes cooking time per pound, and boneless pork chops to need about 23 minutes per pound. Remember, these are only approximations, and the meat's internal temperature is the key to perfectly cooked meals. </p>
<p> Internal Temperature </p>
<p> The cooking time and the color of the pork chops are variable enough to be unreliable measures for knowing when the meat is cooked just right. As the USDA advises that pork must be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 F to be safe. This kills off bacteria in raw pork that can trigger illnesses in humans, such as salmonellosis and trichinosis. Ideally, pork chops shouldn't be cooked beyond this point, since the longer it cooks, the drier and tougher the meat becomes. </p>
<p> Meat Thermometers </p>
<p> Because the pork chop's internal temperature is the key to knowing when it's safely cooked, consider investing in an instant-read meat thermometer. Lots of different types are available and most are generally reliable, so pick a style you like and that fits your budget and follow the usage and care directions. Insert the tip into the center of the thickest pork chop to take a temperature reading. Make sure the thermometer stem doesn't come into contact with bone or the baking tray, as these read hotter than the meat. </p>

<doc id="file14874861" filename="Lumberjack" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumberjack">
<p> Lumberjacks are mostly North American workers in the logging industry who perform the initial harvesting and transport of trees for ultimate processing into forest products. The term usually refers to a bygone era (before 1945 in the United States) when hand tools were used in harvesting trees. Because of its historical ties, the term lumberjack has become ingrained in popular culture through folklore, mass media and spectator sports. The actual work was difficult, dangerous, intermittent, low-paying, and primitive in living conditions. However, the men built a traditional culture that celebrated strength, masculinity, confrontation with danger, and resistance to modernization.[1] </p>
<p> The term lumberjack is of Canadian derivation. The first attested use of the word comes from an 1831 letter to the Cobourg Star and General Advertiser in the following passage: "my misfortunes have been brought upon me chiefly by an incorrigible, though perhaps useful, race of mortals called LUMBERJACKS, whom, however, I would name the Cossack's of Upper Canada, who, having been reared among the oaks and pines of the wild forest, have never been subjected to the salutary restraint of laws."[6] </p>
<p> The term lumberjack is primarily historical; logger is used by workers in the 21st century.[citation needed] When lumberjack is used, it usually refers to a logger from an earlier time before the advent of chainsaws, feller-bunchers and other modern logging equipment.[citation needed] Other terms for the occupation include woodcutter, shanty boy[7] and the colloquial term woodhick (Pennsylvania, US). </p>
<p> A logger employed in driving logs down a river was known locally in northern North America as a river pig, catty-man, river hog, or river rat. The term lumberjill has been known for a woman who does this work; for example, in Britain during World War II.[8] In Australia, the occupation is referred to as timber cutter[9] or cool cutters.[10][11] </p>
<p> Lumberjacks worked in lumber camps and often lived a migratory life, following timber harvesting jobs as they opened.[12] Being a lumberjack was seasonal work. Lumberjacks were exclusively men. They usually lived in bunkhouses or tents. Common equipment included the axe and cross-cut saw. Lumberjacks could be found wherever there were vast forests to be harvested and a demand for wood, most likely in Scandinavia, Canada, and parts of the United States. In the U.S., many lumberjacks were of Scandinavian ancestry, continuing the family tradition. American lumberjacks were first centred in north-eastern states such as Maine. They then followed the general westward migration on the continent to the Upper Midwest, and finally the Pacific Northwest. Stewart Holbrook documented the emergence and westward migration of the classic American lumberjack in his first book, Holy Old Mackinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack. He often wrote colourfully about lumberjacks in his subsequent books, romanticizing them as hard-drinking, hard-working men. Logging camps were slowly phased out between World War II and the early 1960s as crews could by then be transported to remote logging sites in motor vehicles.[13] </p>
<p> The division of labour in lumber camps led to several specialized jobs on logging crews, such as whistle punk, chaser, and high climber.[14] The whistle punk's job was to sound a whistle (usually at the Steam donkey) as a signal to the yarder operator controlling the movement of logs. He also had to act as a safety lookout. A good whistle punk had to be alert and think fast as the safety of the others depended on him. The high climber (also known as a tree topper) used iron climbing hooks and rope to ascend a tall tree in the landing area of the logging site, where he would chop off limbs as he climbed, chop off the top of the tree, and finally attach pulleys and rigging to the tree. After that, it could be used as a spar so logs could be skidded into the landing. High climbers and whistle punks were both phased out in the 1960s to early 1970s when portable steel towers replaced spar trees and radio equipment replaced steam whistles for communication. The choker setters attached steel cables (or chokers) to downed logs so they could be dragged into the landing by the yarder. The chasers removed the chokers once the logs were at the landing. Choker setters and chasers were often entry-level positions on logging crews, with more experienced loggers seeking to move up to more skill-intensive positions such as yarder operator and high climber, or supervisory positions such as hook tender. Despite the common perception that all loggers cut trees, the actual felling and bucking of trees were also specialized job positions done by fallers and buckers. Faller and bucker were once two separate job titles, but they are now combined.[15] </p>
<p> Before the era of modern diesel or gasoline powered equipment, the existing machinery was steam powered. Animal or steam-powered skidders could be used to haul harvested logs to nearby rail roads for shipment to sawmills. Horse driven logging wheels were a means used for moving logs out of the woods. Another way for transporting logs to sawmills was to float them down a body of water or a specially-constructed log flume. Log rolling, the art of staying on top of a floating log while "rolling" the log by walking, was another skill much in demand among lumberjacks. Spiked boots known as "caulks" or "corks" were used for log rolling and often worn by lumberjacks as their regular footwear. </p>
<p> The term "skid row", which today means a poor city neighbourhood frequented by homeless people, originated in a way in which harvested logs were once transported. Logs could be "skidded" down hills or along a corduroy road. One such street in Seattle was named Skid Road. This street later became frequented by people down on their luck, and both the name and its meaning morphed into the modern term. </p>
<p> The Lumberjack Steam Train, a passenger excursion train, operates as part of the museum. </p>
<p> Tomczik (2008) has investigated the lifestyle of lumberjacks from 1840 to 1940, using records from mostly Maine and Minnesota logging camps. In a period of industrial development and modernization in urban areas, logging remained a traditional business in which the workers exhibited pride in their craft, their physical strength and masculinity, and guarded their individualism. Their camps were a bastion of the traditional workplace as they defied modern rationalized management, and built a culture around masculinity. At the peak in 1906 there were 500,000 lumberjacks, who took special pride in their work. Logging camps were located in isolated areas that provided room and board as well as a workplace. With few females present other than the wives of cooks and foremen, lumberjacks lived an independent life style that emphasized manly virtues in doing dangerous tasks. Men earned praise for their skills in doing their work, for being competitive, and for being aggressive. When not at work, they played rough games, told tall tales, and won reputations for consuming large amounts of food. By 1940, the business was undergoing major changes, as access roads and automobiles ended residential logging camps, chain saws replaced crosscut saws, and managers installed modern industrial methods.[17] </p>
<p> A specialty form of logging involving the felling of trees for the production of railroad ties was known as tie hacking. These lumberjacks, called tie hacks, used saws to fell trees and cut to length, and a broad-axe to flatten two or all four sides of the log to create railroad ties. Later, portable saw mills were used to cut and shape ties. Tie hacking was an important form of logging in Wyoming and northern Colorado and the remains of tie hacking camps can be found on National Forest land. The remains of flumes can be seen near Dubois, Wyoming,[18] and Old Roach, Colorado. In addition, a decaying splash dam exists near the Old Roach site as well. There, tie hacks attempted to float logs down to the Laramie River for the annual spring tie drives, and the splash dam was used to collect winter snow-melt to increase the water flow for the tie drive.[19] </p>
<p> Modern technology changed the job of the modern logger considerably. Although the basic task of harvesting trees is still the same, the machinery and tasks are no longer the same. Many of the old job specialties on logging crews are now obsolete. </p>
<p> Chainsaws, harvesters, and feller bunchers are now used to cut or fell trees. The tree is turned into logs by removing the limbs (delimbing) and cutting it into logs of optimal length (bucking). The felled tree or logs are moved from the stump to the landing. Ground vehicles such as a skidder or forwarder can pull, carry, or shovel the logs. Cable systems "cars" can pull logs to the landing. Logs can also be flown to the landing by helicopter. Logs are commonly transported to the sawmill using trucks. Harvesting methods may include clear cutting or selective cutting. Concerns over the environmental impact have led to controversy about modern logging practices. In certain areas of forest loggers re-plant their crop for future generations. </p>
<p> A Wall Street Journal survey on the best jobs in the United States ended by listing being a logger as the "worst" 3D's job,[20] citing "work instability, poor income and pure danger". A Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of America's most dangerous jobs put loggers at the top of the list for 2004. </p>
<p> The sport of Loggersports grew out of competitions in lumber camps aimed at determining the best woodcutters. Today, these competitions are used to acknowledge the rich history of forestry and logging and to keep traditions alive. </p>
<p> STITHL Timbersports Series - Worldwide </p>
<p> The STIHL Timbersports Series was founded in 1985, and brings competitors from across the world to compete in six woodsman or wood chopping competitions. The events are broadcast worldwide on a variety of networks, including ESPN, ABC, and Eurosport.[21] </p>
<p> The Woodsmen's Days events at Tupper Lake, New York commemorate the lumberjack with logging competitions and demonstrations during mid-July. Many colleges have woodsmen teams or forestry clubs who compete regionally, nationally, and internationally. The Association of Southern Forestry Clubs, for example, sponsors an annual Forestry Conclave with 250 contestants and a variety of events. </p>
<p> Lumberjack Tours - United States </p>
<p> There are also lumberjack shows which tour the United States, demonstrating traditional logging practices to the general public. The annual Lumberjack World Championships have been held in Hayward, Wisconsin since 1960.[23] Over 12,000 visitors come to the event each year in late July to watch men and women compete in 21 different events, including log rolling, chopping, timed hot (power) and bucksaw cutting, and tree climbing.[24] </p>
<p> A "lumbersexual" or "urban lumberjack" is a man who has adopted style traits typical of a traditional lumberjack, namely a beard, plaid shirt, and/or scruffy hair, substituting otherwise clean-cut and fashionable style choices.[25] They are also often adorned by neck tattoos and "sleeve" tattoos, and wear large gauged piercings in their earlobes. Denver Nicks described the trend as perhaps an attempt to "reclaim masculinity".[26][27][28][29] The term "lumbersexual" is a variant of the earlier "metrosexual", which was coined in the 1990s. </p>
<p> In popular culture, the stereotypical lumberjack is a strong, burly, usually bearded man who lives to brave the natural environment. He is depicted wearing suspenders, a long-sleeved plaid flannel shirt, and heavy caulk boots, and is often characterized as having a voracious appetite, especially for flapjacks.[citation needed] He works by cutting down trees with either an axe or with the help of another lumberjack and a crosscut saw, as opposed to the modern chainsaw.[30] </p>
<p> The most famous depiction of a lumberjack in folklore is Paul Bunyan. Several towns claim to have been Paul Bunyan's home and have constructed statues of Bunyan and his blue ox "Babe".[31] </p>
<p> Known for their many exploits, many real life loggers have become renowned for their extraordinary strength, intuition, and knowledge of the woods. Men such as Jigger Johnson, the Maine woodsman who supposedly kicked knots off frozen logs barefooted,[32][2] and Joseph Montferrand (better known as Big Joe Mufferaw), the French-Canadian known for his physical prowess and desire to protect the French-speaking logger,[33] have been celebrated as folk heroes throughout North America, and have contributed to the mythos of the Lumberjack.[34] </p>

<p> The Alphabet of Manliness, 2006, by Maddox, lists the lumberjack as one of 26 examples (each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet) of the pinnacle of manliness </p>
<p> The lives of loggers have been featured on the following American television series: </p>
<p> Lumberjacks rapidly developed their own distinctive musical culture of work songs. Many were based on traditional European folk tunes, with lyrics that reflected the lives, experiences and concerns of lumberjacks, with the themes of cutting, hauling, rolling, and driving, as well as narrative songs that involved romance.[36] </p>

<p> Made In Chef’s Knife: A French Design Combining Time-Honored Tradition and Innovative Technique </p>
<p> We occasionally link to goods offered by vendors to help the reader find relevant products. Some of these may be affiliate based, meaning we earn small commissions (at no additional cost to you) if items are purchased. Here is more about what we do. </p>
<p> Despite all of our mothers’ repeated warnings, everyone here at Foodal loves playing with sharp objects. </p>
<p> We’ve been obsessed with cutting, slicing, dicing, and chopping our way through all of our many knife reviews. </p>
<p> So it should be of no surprise to any of you that we’re equally as excited to review yet another amazing cutlery piece… </p>
<p> Sorry, mom. </p>
<p> In addition to its premium line of direct-to-consumer basic cookware, the company Made In recently launched another kitchen essential that every pro chef and home cook needs to own: </p>
<p> The chef’s knife! </p>
<p> In this review, we’ll analyze the construction, materials, and design of this crucial cutlery piece from the company. We’ll also inform you on how to clean, care, and store it to maintain its high-quality performance. </p>
<p> What You Need to Know, Up Front </p>
<p> The Made In Chef’s Knife is a fully forged, nitrogen-treated blade made 100% in France. It is made from X50CrMoV15 premium metal, with a full tang and stainless steel rivets. </p>
<p> The blade is 8.5 inches long, and the entire length of the knife is 13 inches overall. </p>
<p> It weighs 0.5 pounds. </p>
<p> There are two different handle color options to consider purchasing: bright red or white. </p>
<p> Bon Voyage, Made In! </p>
<p> From its start in 2017, Made In’s stark determination to become the leading kitchen brand has led the company from working with experienced manufacturers and materials in the United States, to traveling across the globe in France in order to find the best resources possible for its production. </p>
<p> For this cutlery piece, the company partnered with a knife maker business in Thiers, France. This area is also known as the knife capital of the world, due to the city’s passionate history in the cutlery industry dating back over 700 years ago. </p>
<p> Made In chose this region for manufacturing due to a few core reasons, based on time-honored traditions and innovative techniques and designs. </p>
<p> So it’s not just because Thiers is a gorgeous, breathtaking, mountainous foreign village in one of the most romantic countries in the world… but I’m sure that was some sort of influence on the Made In owners… </p>
<p> Family-Owned Business </p>
<p> Much like Made In, whose founders have a deep family history in the kitchen supply business (over a century of experience combined!), the Thiers knife maker they partnered with is a family-owned business, respecting the longstanding traditions of forgery across 5 generations. </p>
<p> The owners of Made In personally travelled to Thiers to meet the makers, to learn more about how both city and maker share the innovation behind artisanal forgery and the passion for creating the best product: </p>
<p> Focusing on Fully Forged Metal </p>
<p> Thiers is one of the few production regions in the world that still makes 100% fully forged knives from just a single rod of metal, a rare practice in today’s production process. </p>
<p> Made In’s knife is produced from a single rod of X50CrMoV15 stainless steel sourced from France, considered to be the best material. </p>
<p> The metal is heated and hammered into the blade, bolster, and handle – it runs the entire length of the blade through the handle, almost like a spine, giving it more balance and structural integrity. </p>
<p> There is no welding, stamping, or laser cutting, cheap and quick methods of manufacturing knives that create a blade that is less hard, less durable, and duller. </p>
<p> And partially forging knives, when the blade is welded to its bolster and handle, yields a tool with less balance and overall inferior quality compared to one that is fully forged. </p>
<p> Quite clearly, there are many advantages to using knives forged with just one piece of metal! The blade is stronger, sharper, and very durable. It won’t break down quickly, and will keep an edge for a longer period of time throughout multiple uses. </p>
<p> Learning More about Nitrogen Treatment </p>
<p> As another unique feature that sets Made In apart from many other brands, the knives are also treated with nitrogen for long-lasting sharpness, strength, and corrosion resistance. </p>
<p> Many other companies add additional carbon to their knives for the purpose of yielding a harder blade. While adding more carbon strengthens the blade, there are serious disadvantages to this decision – the blade is more difficult to care for, since it becomes more susceptible to rust, discoloration, and chipping. </p>
<p> Using a nitrogen-hardening treatment, rather than using additional carbon, offers the best of both worlds – it is both fortified and easy to maintain. </p>
<p> Here’s the basic process: before the rod is forged, the raw metal is first completely immersed in liquid nitrogen at a chilly -58°F. </p>
<p> Chemical compounds are actually transformed during this stage of production (from austenite to martensite), with the final result being a product that is stronger, sharper, and more resistant to corrosion… and a product that you don’t have to worry about polishing and sharpening after every use! Yay! </p>
<p> A Perfect Rockwell Hardness Score </p>
<p> To provide an accurate measurement of hardness, knife producers undergo the Rockwell Hardness test, which measures the hardness of steel with a numerical score. </p>
<p> The hardness of the blade is an important quality of a premium blade – one that’s too hard is more prone to breaking and chipping, while one that is too soft is dull and needs more maintenance to keep the edge sharp. </p>
<p> The combination of a fully forged and nitrogen-treated knife strikes the perfect balance between hardness and softness – it is strong enough to withstand heavy usage, without the risk of breaking. </p>
<p> This gives the tool a superior Rockwell Hardness Score of 58-60. </p>
<p> Care and Keeping </p>
<p> Made In has made it so easy for us to clean, maintain, and store it! </p>
<p> The company (as well as everyone here at Foodal) does not recommend cleaning it in the dishwasher. To maintain the quality of the blade, it is always best to wash by hand with warm, soapy water. Dry immediately. </p>
<p> Each one comes with a custom sheath as part of your purchase for safe and easy storage – and it can easily fit in any kitchen drawer when not in use. </p>
<p> But who are we kidding… we’ll be cooking with this French beauty in the kitchen constantly! </p>

<p> After watching Forged in Fire, I am fascinated with forged knives. Thank you for the wonderful description! </p>
<p> Happy to hear of your interest in forged knives, Ellie! Let us know if you decide to buy and try any of the knives we recommend! </p>
<p> Thiers, France is ” the world capital of knife making”? Are you certain about that? </p>
<p> Thiers certainly has some good knife makers. So does Seki city in Japan (a lot more knife makers in Seki than in Thiers these days, actually). And so does Solingen, Germany (again, numbers in Solingen are looking a bit higher than Thiers). Toledo, Spain. Sheffield, UK. I could mention cities in Sweden, Switzerland and Czech Republic with good numbers as well. And closer to home, even your native Pittsburg PA has several. Don’t forget the people over by Franklinville NY either. The list goes on. </p>
<p> Not quite sure Thiers is the world capital? Maybe define your parameters??? </p>
<p> I would guess that those knives might get a cryogenic liquid Nitrogen treatment AFTER forging- And probably after some post forge rough grinding to shape/size + a hardening heat treatment/quench cycle, not BEFORE forging. Because doing it before hand would be a waste of manufacturer’s time and liquid Nitrogen. </p>
<p> Also, liquid Nitrogen quenching is about -196 C or -320.4 F., RATHER chillier than -54 F, which is not even as cold as dry ice. </p>
<p> Maybe that was just a translation error, French is so confusing and French people just INSIST on using Centigrade/SI units/metric system, almost like the invented that stuff or something. Oh WAIT. They DID?! </p>
<p> 58-60 isn’t terribly soft, it’s nearly as hard as a good Japanese knife, mine run 61 to 65 depending on maker & use. Somewhat harder than tradtitional, easy to sharpen German (and French) knives, commonly around 56-58. </p>
<p> Say, that knife STEEL was SOURCED in France. The factory is where, again? Thiers, in France? </p>
<p> Why does “Made in” say that they sell solely USA made products then? Just looked at their January 19th interview where the owners said that. </p>
<p> Thanks for your thoughtful comments and corrections, Robert! Though describing Thiers as the knife capital of the world is certainly a matter of opinion – one that the manufacturer embraces wholeheartedly – other items that you have brought to our attention were factual errors. We will publish an update to this article as soon as possible, after we have received some additional details regarding the manufacturing process from Made In. </p>
<p> Made In does currently sell a product line that is completely made in the USA, except for their chef’s knife. </p>

<p> Making Easter Lamb Cake </p>
<p> Walk into any Italian bakery at Easter time and you will see an abundance of Easter lamb cakes, they’ve been a yearly tradition in many households since the late 194o’s and 50’s. They’re used as an eatable centerpiece for your Easter table or to give as a gift during the season. </p>
<p> I’ve always wanted to make my own Easter lamb cake but I never had the molds that I remembered from my childhood, plus I didn’t think I could ever pull it off anyway! </p>
<p> In comes my friend Janet who’s been making these cakes every Easter since 1947, she makes them for her family and also gives them away as gifts. So I asked her if I could hang out with her one day and watch/help her make one, and she kindly said yes. </p>
<p> I was especially excited because she had the vintage mold that I remembered as a child, it was well used and still in perfect working order. She told me all the ladies back in the 40’s and 50’s made lamb cakes and as a child her mother and grandmother taught her how to make them and to keep up the tradition. </p>
<p> She pulled out some older vintage recipes for making lamb cakes, like this one published in 1953 in a Good Housekeeping cake book. </p>
<p> Over the years Janet has perfected her own recipe for lamb cake which is a nice sturdy sour cream pound cake flavored with vanilla and other extracts of your choice, we also added some rum to ours. </p>
<p> Watching Janet whip up the batter was like watching a pro in action, I swear she could do this in her sleep! </p>
<p> I was in charge of buttering and flouring the mold, she instructed me to get into every nook and cranny, using my clean fingers to get in there. She stressed how important it was so as not to have your cake stick. She said I did good! </p>
<p> Janet recommends placing your mold on a baking sheet for easy in and out of the oven. Pour your batter only in one side of the mold, always the face side down, never fill both sides of the mold, never, and make sure you don’t fill past the rim, you’ll have problems when you release it. Another tip she had was to take a spoon and carefully place batter into the ears, face and neck, if it sinks down add a little add more, none of those areas should be lacking any batter. </p>
<p> Janet also likes to reinforce the ears by adding a toothpick in each, the ears are tiny and you don’t want them to break off, some people put a toothpick or skewer in the neck also, but she never had a problem with it. Make sure your edges are all clean, take a paper towel to wipe them off. Now attach the empty back of the mold and you’re ready to bake! </p>
<p> Janet told me not to worry if you see the mold spit open a little towards the end of the baking time, it’s normal as the cake rises inside. She even stood it upright and baked it like that for the last few minutes. </p>
<p> If you’re going to frost it right away the cake has to be completely cooled down, do it in the standing position after you get it out of the mold, so have a cup of coffee like we did and be patient! </p>
<p> If you want to bake your lambs ahead of time feel free to freeze them at this point, before you decorate them, just make sure they’re cooled down and wrapped well for the freezer. </p>
<p> Now the fun part begins, it’s time to decorate the little lamb-y! Janet whipped up the frosting in no time as she was telling me in disgust just how terrible store bought frosting is and why people just don’t make there own because it’s so easy. I totally agree! </p>
<p> Her frosting consisted of 1 stick of unsalted butter, powdered sugar, half and half and vanilla, no recipe, just until you get the right texture, you’ll know, she said. </p>
<p> You can decorate your. Easter lamb cakes anyway you want to, be creative! </p>
<p> Take your frosting and cover the lamb completely with it, all over, except where your eyes and nose will be placed. You don’t have to be perfect because the flaked coconut sticks very well and will cover any flaws. Remember, no coconut on the eye nose area. </p>
<p> The eyes where made with 2 plumped up raisins that she squished down to form an oval shape. To prepare the nose she dabbed a little red food coloring on the tip and then placed half of a maraschino cherry on top. </p>
<p> Tie a pretty ribbon of your choice around the neck, Janet said she use to put tiny bells on the ribbon but can’t find them so much anymore. </p>
<p> We used paper grass to place all around the lamb to finish it off, Janet doesn’t like using the other kind because it flies around too much. Add eggs and jellybeans for additional color and whimsey all around. </p>
<p> Thank you Janet for a fun day of baking, I feel like a pro now and have the confidence to make my own so much so that when I got home I went on Ebay, saw a vintage lamb cake mold and put a bid on it, wish me luck! </p>
<p> For those of you who would like to try this on your own, Nordic Ware has a similar mold to the one I used. A perfect addition to your Easter table! </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 350 F. generously butter and flour lamb mold. </p>
<p> Beat butter, add sugar and extracts and beat until light and fluffy. </p>
<p> Add flour with baking soda until well incorporated. </p>
<p> Beat in eggs one at a time alternating with the sour cream until batter comes together. </p>
<p> Pour batter into prepared face side of the lamb mold, facing down on a baking sheet. </p>
<p> Fill to the rim wiping up the edges clean. </p>
<p> Reinforce the ears by placing a toothpick horizontally in each ear. </p>
<p> Carefully place lid on and bake for 1 hour, but check for doneness 10 minutes before. </p>
<p> FYI, you will have leftover batter with this recipe, enough to make a small cake. </p>
<p> For Decorating, make the frosting with the butter, powdered sugar, vanilla, half and half and a pinch of salt, mixing until you get a nice semi firm frosting. </p>
<p> Add raisins for eyes, a cherry for nose and tie a ribbon around the neck. </p>
<p> Comments </p>
<p> This is adorable, Marie! How nice to spend the afternoon making this cute cake with your friend. I believe Nordic Ware still sells the same lamb mold. I’ve seen it on different sources this year. I already own too many Nordic Ware mold cake pans to buy another one–I have the stand up bunny cake pan that Williams Sonoma is selling again this year –it is also a 3D mold. </p>
<p> My mother-in-law used to make this cake. We could not wait to cut into it. She did not want anyone around when she baked because we distracted her and she would forget an ingredient. We learned to stay clear when she was baking. I love that you got to cook with your friend. I think it is wonderful. </p>
<p> Oh how cute is that lamb-y? I haven’t made one of these in at least three or four years and now you have me thinking I’ll do one for Easter this year for sure. My mom always made these at Easter and it’s especially sweet if you have young children around. Your step by step photos are really helpful to anyone who’s never made one of these Marie. Between your Easter lamb and Domenica’s ricotta crostata, I think I’ll have a lot of sweet offerings on the Easter table. </p>
<p> Oh my God, you’ve made me so happy! I have my Grandma’s lamb and bunny molds in a place of honor in my kitchen but they’re there for decorative purposes only because my experiments to recreate her cakes were disasters. Now I know what we’re having for Easter dessert. I could just cry. I will think of you and Nonna Vera when I bake these cakes. Thank you so much. </p>
<p> My mom made this every year at Easter. When i was little, I would cry when someone ate the head. The pans are long gone, but it would be fun to bake one again. </p>
<p> Oh, how sweet. I have never made a lamb cake, but I sure have admired them for ages. I remember having them when I was a little. Thanks for the sweet memories. I bet you had a ball with this one! </p>
<p> I remember the Easter Lamb cake as the centerpiece for my Italian grandma’s Easter table. I found a mold years ago in a thrift shop and it’s been my annual tradition to make this cake for Easter ever since. Instead of using fake grass, I add a couple drops of green food coloring to some coconut, mix until colored as desired, and place around base of lamb. More coconut is yummy and the jelly beans are placed on the “grass”. Sometimes I place edible flowers such as pansies or violas on the grass. My adult kids and friends always look for the lamb…and so the tradition continues. </p>
<p> Marie, I love this post!! I’ve been wanting to make a Lamb Cake for Easter the last couple years, but had read mixed reviews about the pan and the process of making this 3-D cake. Can you give me a tip on where to find this particular pan? I’d love to try it out this year! </p>
<p> Oh…….sorry, Marie. I just realized you put a link in the post. I was just so excited!! </p>
<p> Oh when we were cleaning out my parent house I got to go through the recipe drawers and I found that cookbook! I gave it to one of my nieces. My mom made that cake quiet often. Thanks for the wonderful memories! </p>
<p> What a fun tutorial post to read, Marie! I do remember these cakes, from my childhood. Though, I never got to try one. They really are adorable. I hope you got the mold on eBay, though the one on Amazon looks pretty close. Good luck in recreating it. I’m sure you’ll do just fine. </p>
<p> Although we are not Italian (we are 100% Irish) my mother’s family has been making these cakes since the 50’s and now it is my tradition to continue. I have their vintage molds and my sister and I recreate it each year. We always called our cake the “Lamb of God” cake and look forward to it every year. It makes a think of our Nana. Thanks for the great recipe. </p>
<p> Renee, my family never made those we just made a sweet ricotta pie minus the grain, the recipe is on my blog. </p>
<p> What a wonderful post! I grew up in a very Italian family – but my Nonna never made this cake. I know I would have LOVED it! This Easter, I’m going to try to make one for my God-Daughters! If all goes well…. I have a feeling this will start a new tradition (that my Nonna would have been proud of!). Thanks so much for this! xoxo </p>
<p> My grandmother used to make these every Pascha/Easter. I have been carrying on the tradition with my children. I mix green food coloring with coconut flakes for the grass. I also use jelly beans for the eyes and nose. They’re a big hit every year! Adorable. </p>
<p> Yes it is Toni, that was my friends old family recipe, but I don’t see why you can’t cut it down a little. </p>
<p> I made your friend’s recipe tonight. I inadvertently used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3…and it is delicious (in response to the lady who asked). The cake came out of the mold like magic …I’ll never use anything but Crisco to grease cake pans again. This cake is tender and delicious…but stable enough to hold up in this mold. Happy Easter! </p>
<p> Good to know Jennifer, I like the less sugar addition, I will try that myself! So glad you liked it. </p>
<p> I couldn’t tell you Carol, I just followed her recipe, I’m not really a baker per say </p>
<p> Thank you, Marie. I was very happy to find this recipe along with the step-by-step commentary and beautiful photos. I plan to try making it, for sure! </p>
<p> Trackbacks </p>

<p> Milk-Braised Pork Chops with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy </p>
<p> Braising pork in milk, a method that Jimmy Bannos Jr., of The Purple Pig learned while cooking in Florence, results in supertender meat and an incredibly rich and flavorful gravy. Although the dish is rooted in Tuscan tradition, Bannos adds an American comfort-food spin by serving it with mashed potatoes. Slideshow: Great Pork Chop Recipes </p>
<p> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter </p>
<p> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </p>
<p> How to Make It </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> In a large enameled cast-iron casserole, heat the olive oil until shimmering. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper and add them to the casserole. Cook over moderately high heat, turning once, until golden, about 7 minutes total. Transfer the chops to a plate. </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper to the casserole and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until the vegetables just start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the stock, thyme, bay leaves and 2 cups of the milk and bring to a simmer. Return the pork chops to the casserole, cover and braise over very low heat until tender, about 2 hours. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cover the potatoes with water and bring to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and simmer over moderate heat until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Add the cream and 4 tablespoons of the butter to the saucepan and warm over low heat until the butter is melted. Pass the potatoes through a ricer into a bowl, then stir in the warm cream-butter sauce. Season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper; keep warm. </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Transfer the pork chops to a platter and cover with foil. Spoon 4 cups of the braising liquid and vegetables into a blender, discarding the bay leaves, thyme sprigs and remaining vegetables and liquid. Puree the vegetable sauce until smooth. </p>
<p> Step </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> In a medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over moderately high heat. Whisk in the flour and cook until bubbling. Whisk in the vegetable sauce and the remaining 1/2 cup of milk; cook over moderate heat, whisking, until the gravy is thickened and no floury taste remains, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the chops with the mashed potatoes and gravy. </p>

<p> This Pork Chop Recipe Is Preeeetty Much Impossible to Mess Up </p>
<p> I thought pork chops were a dry, sad, never-make-at-home dish. This recipe changed my mind. </p>
<p> When I was a kid, pork chops were one thing: thin-cut, Shake ‘n Baked, and dry. They were usually served with those boxed mashed potato flakes that my parents added water to in order to make them...mashed potato-ish. Suffice it to say, I thought I hated pork chops and mashed potatoes for most of my life. But then I had a transformative experience eating a Berkshire pork chop at Riverpark, one of Tom Colicchio’s restaurants in New York City, about eight years ago. It was grilled with peaches and cipollini onions, perfectly pink in the middle, and incredibly juicy. I vowed then and there to start making pork chops at home, but it wasn’t until...seven years later...that I actually did the damn thing. </p>
<p> Our juicy pan-seared pork chop recipe was the ideal point of entry into pork chop cookery, because it has a built-in fail-safe for not overcooking the chops. Pork can get dry and tough very easily, even if you just accidentally leave it in the pan a few minutes after the heat is off. There are two nifty tricks with this recipe: You basically only cook the chops on one side and kiss them with heat on the other, and you smother them with delicious citrus vinaigrette after to really guarantee there is no shortage of juiciness and flavor. The dressing is made mostly of things you probably have on hand: lemon zest, juice, garlic, mustard, oregano, cumin, sugar, olive oil, and cilantro. I have made it without cilantro and it’s fine, albeit a little less bright and herby. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> There is another sneaky part of this recipe that ensures your meat caramelizes: a little sugar sprinkled over one side of the four ½-inch-thick chops so they get as deeply bronzed as possible. This all happens quickly—5 minutes on the first side, 1 minute on the second, and a 10-minute rest in the skillet for carryover cooking—giving you time to roast vegetables, make a pot of rice, or dress a salad, depending on how lazy you are. OH, AND THE BEST PART: you whisk the pan juices from the pork into the dressing! Everything in life should be more porky. </p>
<p> Since I am a single woman who lives in a studio apartment by myself, I usually just make two pork chops. But if I want leftovers for lunches throughout the week, I make extras, slice them up after they’ve rested, and make rice bowls. I’ve found that if you just zap the pork in the microwave for a minute or less, it doesn’t overcook and get dry or rubbery. But it is just as good tucked into summer rolls or on top of a salad. Also: Make extra citrus dressing. It goes great on Bibb lettuce with crunchy vegetables and sliced pork. </p>
<p> Pork chops still aren’t my everyday weeknight dinner, but whenever I get a craving, I know I’m only 15 minutes away from the juiciest ones ever. Now I am going to send this recipe to my mom, who may still Shake ‘n Bake for her and my dad, and hopefully start a new Whitney family tradition. </p>
<p> Get the recipe: </p>
<p> Rather than marinating these chops ahead of time, which, let’s face it, doesn’t work on weeknights, we came up with a citrus-mustard-cilantro dressing that bathes the chops in punchy flavor after they’ve cooked. The pinch of sugar helps these chops take on lots of color, and hard-searing on just one side ensures they’re not overcooked. See the step-by-step instructions here. </p>

<p> Nonna’s Sponge Cake </p>
<p> Nonna’s Sponge Cake, this is that perfect lemony, fluffy and airy cake that most Italian nonnas make to perfection! </p>
<p> I was intimidated by this cake for the longest time. The cake that I call Nonna’s Sponge cake. I’ve tasted endless versions of it made by Italian nonnas everywhere. Each one of them bursting with pride as they serve their delicious, fluffy creation and share their tips and techniques for the perfect cake. </p>
<p> What sets one cake apart from the other and determines the successful outcome is the height, the dramatic height! Each time I take a bite I’m in awe at how Nonna’s Sponge Cake, such a simple cake made with few ingredients could be so utterly amazing! </p>
<p> I finally decided it was time to overcome my intimidation with this cake. I was at a bride’s home this fall on her wedding day (in case you were not aware, at Italian weddings there’s always a pre-ceremony buffet at the bride’s parents home). Once again, I came face to face with The Cake! I quickly sought out the baker of the cake and, of course, it was the nonna of the bride. </p>
<p> It lay on the buffet table untouched. I had to slice that first piece for me. Heavenly! I immediately began to praise her and, like nonnas everywhere, she explained that it was such an easy recipe and she could practically make it blindfolded. She then began to list the ingredients, which as you could imagine, she knew by heart. I quickly pulled out my cell phone and jotted down the ingredients and quantities. She did not specify any instructions as it’s obvious how to put a cake together, isn’t it? </p>
<p> What do you need to make Nonna’s Sponge Cake? </p>
<p> One week later, I attempted it without much success. Although the flavor was wonderful, it didn’t have that dramatic height. The only thing I knew for sure, is that you have to invert the cake pan immediately when you take it out of the oven. It must remain upside down until completely cooled in order to get that light, fluffy texture. This is the two piece tube cake pan with prongs that is necessary in order for air to be able to circulate underneath the cake while cooling. </p>
<p> Watch my video on how to make Nonna’s Sponge Cake! </p>
<p> How to make Nonna’s Sponge Cake: </p>
<p> The ingredients are quite few but need to be combined in this exact order: </p>
<p> Separate the eggs. Place the yolks in a large mixing bowl and the whites in the bowl of your stand mixer. </p>
<p> Add sugar and vegetable oil and whisk with the egg yolks until you have a smooth, pale yellow mixture that forms ribbons when you lift the whisk. </p>
<p> Add the lemon zest and lemon juice and combine. </p>
<p> Sift the flour and baking powder and stir into the egg mixture. </p>
<p> Finally, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold half the egg whites into the batter, then carefully stir in the remaining half. </p>
<p> Grease the cake pan with butter and dust lightly with flour before adding the batter. </p>
<p> Bake in the center of a 350F preheated oven for 50 minutes. </p>
<p> When the cake comes out of the oven it must be carefully flipped over in order to cool completely. </p>
<p> Carefully unmold it from the pan, dust lightly with powdered sugar and serve! </p>
<p> A few tips for a successful cake: </p>
<p> A two piece tube cake pan or angel food cake pan with extended prongs is necessary to make this cake. When the pan is inverted it will stand on its prongs thus allowing air to circulate underneath to cool it. </p>
<p> Do not over flour the cake pan otherwise the cake may slip out when inverted. If the cake partially dislodges itself from the pan, leave it be and let it cool completely. </p>
<p> For best results, the eggs should be at room temperature. </p>
<p> Do not over stir the mixture once you’ve added the egg whites. Stir just until the egg whites are incorporated as the batter must remain light and airy. </p>
<p> So, you may be thinking, all this for a sponge cake? Yes! Believe me, it’s all worth it. All it requires is a dusting of powdered sugar and you’re set. No fancy icing, layers, sprinkles, chocolate chips or anything else. This cake is perfection! </p>
<p> I’m still working on getting more height on my cake. Recently a relative baked one for me. I actually measured the cake and it was 11.2 centimeters high! I’m challenging each of you who loves to bake to try it out and let me know how high yours turns out. Meanwhile, I will continue baking this cake until I reach this height. Good luck to all of you! </p>
<p> I almost forgot to mention something! In honor of all the dedicated nonnas out there who bake this cake, especially those who deliver one to me, I have decided to simply name the cake Nonna’s Sponge Cake! </p>
<p> I can’t wait to hear how your cake turns out. Let me know by tagging me with photos of your beautiful cakes with @mangiabedda or #mangiabedda on Facebook or Instagram. Feel free to Pin the recipe for later. Enjoy! </p>
<p> Nonna’s Sponge Cake </p>
<p> Light, fluffy and airy, Nonna's Sponge Cake is the cake that all Italian nonnas make better than anyone else. A must in all Italian households! </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 350°F and lightly grease a two piece tube pan with butter and dust lightly with flour. Shake out excess flour. </p>
<p> Separate the eggs placing the egg yolks in a large mixing bowl and the whites in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. </p>
<p> Add the sugar and oil to the egg yolks and whisk vigorously for several minutes until the mixture is pale yellow, thick and forms ribbons when you lift the whisk out of the bowl. </p>
<p> Stir in the lemon rind and lemon juice. Add the sifted flour and baking powder. Stir until well combined. </p>
<p> Whisk the egg whites in the mixer on medium-high speed until the whites form stiff peaks, about 3-4 minutes. </p>
<p> Using a rubber spatula, gently fold half of the egg whites into the batter. When completely incorporated, fold in the remaining egg whites. </p>
<p> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 50 minutes in the center of the oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean. Time may vary according to your oven. </p>
<p> When you remove the cake from the oven, gently turn it upside down on a flat surface and allow to cool completely before unmolding the cake, about an hour. Dust lightly with powdered sugar before serving. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> A two piece tube cake pan or angel food cake pan with extended prongs is necessary to make this cake. When the pan is inverted it will stand on its prongs thus allowing air to circulate underneath to cool it. </p>
<p> Do not over flour the cake pan otherwise the cake may slip out when turned upside down. If the cake partially dislodges itself from the pan, leave it be and let it cool completely. </p>
<p> For best results, the eggs should be at room temperature. </p>
<p> Do not over stir the mixture once you've added the egg whites. Stir just until the egg whites are incorporated as the batter must remain light and airy. </p>

<p> Made it again today This time I used an orange instead of a lemon It is yummy I also did not flour the pan because last time it fell out when I turned it over This time I just ran a thin knife around the sides when it cooled upside down and it came out great </p>
<p> I got your photos, it looks fantastic. Thanks so much for taking the time to send them! </p>
<p> Hi Meggs, thanks for sharing this with me! I have no doubt it’s delicious with orange as well. I think I’ll have to try not adding flour next time as well, thanks for the tip! </p>
<p> to add stability to whipped egg whites, add a pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar for each egg white you use. It will help keep the whites from deflating when you very carefully fold them into the yolk mixture. You might try alternating adding the whites and the flour by 4ths rather than mixing the flour into the yolks. That’s how the Austrians make fluffy sponge cakes. Your cake looks so good! </p>
<p> Hello Sue, I’m always open to trying new things, thanks for the suggestion. That can help for sure, although I know for sure that the Italian nonna’s that make this cake don’t use this method. I guess it’s lots of experience! </p>
<p> Amazing cake However it did dislodge when I inverted it!!!! It is only 7 1/4 c high Not like your relative who made one 11c !!!!!! However it is absolutely yummy Thanks for sharing </p>
<p> Hello Meggs, thank you for sharing this with me. This is a cake that definitely takes some practice, however no matter how high or low it is or if it dislodges it is definitely always tasty. Glad you enjoyed it! </p>
<p> I made 4 layers of this cake for an 80th birthday cake. And made it again in a bundt pan for t Sunday tea. It was FANTASTIC! Don’t get fixated on the height! It is highly enough, and more importantly – very light, lemony and delicious! </p>
<p> Hi Sharon, thanks for sharing this with me! I have never tried this as a layer cake and I’m sure it was delicious. And you’re right, it’s all about the airy texture and lemony flavor. Thanks again! </p>
<p> Great cake!! I made it for my friend’s soirée and it was a hit. The height was perfect! I baked it in a Bundt pan and cooled it upside down. The only drawback…it was a bit dry, but the flavor was amazing. Next time I will try with cake flour. Thanks for the recipe!!! How do I send a picture. It came out beautiful. </p>
<p> Hi Nikki, thank you for your feedback, I’m so glad you enjoyed it! You can send me a photo to my email account at mangiabedda@gmail.com. Thanks again for sharing with me! </p>
<p> Hi Miss Nadia I was just curious to know have you ever tried this cake in layer cake pans? </p>
<p> Hello Tonda, I have actually never tried that before. Because of the nature of the recipes requiring that the cake be flipped over to cool and maintain it’s airy texture, I’m not quite sure how it would turn out baked in layer pans. But if you do try, please let me know how it turns out. Thanks for stopping by my blog! </p>
<p> This cake is excellent – lovely texture/crumb, height and taste! I made it this week and had fantastic results, that far exceed the amount of effort to make. Just read the comments (ha! I should really make a point of reading them before…) and agree about greasing the pan. Next time I will skip that step, as ungreased pan gives the batter more ability to climb the sides when baking. I will also try the orange variations suggested by some reviewers, and the addition of vanilla. How can anything go wrong with orange and vanilla? BTW, I have been trying to convert my recipes to weight (as Europeans do – I see the wisdom of this practice), so use 150 gr = 1 cup flour (225 gr for the 1.5 cups flour in this recipe). Also since lemons vary so much in size and juiciness, I did some research to establish the juice of a lemon = 2 TBSP. </p>
<p> Hi Gabriella, so glad to hear you enjoyed it! And yes this cake is definitely versatile in that you can change the flavor with orange and vanilla instead of lemon. Either way it’s delicious! Thanks for sharing that you skipped the greasing of the pan as well. I’ll have to share that tip with the Italian nonna that shared her recipe with me. Thanks for your tips! </p>
<p> My mom used a rising powder that comes in a little “bustina” as she calls it. It made such a difference. I know you could find it at Italian grocery stores. I’m going to find some and let you know 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi Josie, yes I’ve seen it I think it’s called lievito degli angeli. It’s acts like a leavening agent and from what I’ve understood it’s similar to our baking powder however sometimes it’s flavored with vanilla as well. I’ve never tried it in this cake but it’s definitely worth a try. Let me know if you give it a try! </p>
<p> I just put one in the oven. I’m not a baker but I followed your instructions exactly. So in 50 minutes plus cooling I’ll let you know, can’t wait! </p>
<p> Thanks for the recipe … I grew up with this cake and making it brought back many wonderful memories ! I greased my tube pan with shortening and dusted it ever so lightly and lined the bottom with parchment paper . I remember my mother doing this and it always turning out beautifully ! All said and done the aroma is wonderful and the height was 101/2 cm … now you have me wondering if I could go higher ! Will definitely do this recipe again ! Thanks for sharing ! </p>
<p> I just took one out of the oven and it is cooling. This was my mom’s specialty. She was know for this cake. I agree about not greasing you pan. My mom also told me to add egg mixture to the egg whites a little at a time and fold together gently until most of it is combined. Does not need to be completely incorporated. This will also help with it to rise higher. I use vanilla but will try lemon next time. Is great with fruit toppings especially fresh strawberries… </p>
<p> Hi Rosemary, hope you enjoyed it! I actually do grease and flour the pan. I’ll try your mom’s suggestion to not completely incorporate the egg whites and hopefully mine will rise even higher. Thanks for stopping by my blog! </p>
<p> Hello Nadia Your sponge cake recipe is very similar to my own which was also given to me by a nonna ( my husband’s aunt). Its a no fail recipe. It always comes out nice and high! 14″ high! The only differences are i add 3/4 cup pure orange juice, 3 tsp of baking powder, 2cups flour, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/2 cup oil. I dont add lemon or its juice. Just orange rind. </p>
<p> Maybe these small changes in measuements will give more height in your cake. Adding the salt is very important because thats what activates the baking powder. </p>
<p> Hi Maria, thanks for sharing your recipe! It’s interesting but most nonnas I have spoken to don’t add any salt ti their cakes and they have that incredible height. I’ll have to test out your suggestion. Thanks for your feedback and for stopping by my blog! </p>
<p> Hi Maria, I want to try your version of Nonna’s cake. Can you send me your recipe using the orange juice. </p>
<p> Hi Jenny, for the orange juice version you would simply follow the same recipe and replace the zest and juice of the lemon with the zest and juice of one orange. Thanks for your question and hope you enjoy it! </p>
<p> This sounds like a chiffon cake my mom used to make. Try baking it in a ungreased tube pan. It should raise a lot higher. </p>
<p> Yes basically it is. The nonna that gave me the recipe told me she greases it. Will it come out if it is not greased? Thanks for your feedback! </p>
<p> I too make this sponge cake. I have never greased the pan though. I was told it won’t rise as high. You just carefully run a knife along the outside to release it. Your cake looks lovely! I think I will go bake one now! </p>
<p> That’s interesting, I was told I should grease the pan but I think I’ll try your way next time. Always looking to get more height on my cake! Thanks for stopping by my blog! </p>
<p> The one I make calls for 7 eggs and sometimes instead of the lemon I use an orange(rind & juice) to change the flavor but I never grease the 2 piece tube pan. After it has cooled completely run a knife around the pan and also around the tube and flip it over, it will still be attached to the bottom part which I then run a knife between the cake and the pan and slides right out. </p>
<p> Hi Gina, yes you can use orange instead of lemon in this recipe. There is lots of debate about whether to grease the pan or not. The Italian nonna who shared this recipe with me lightly greases her pan. There are many others who have told me that they do not grease the pan. I think next time I’ll try not greasing the pan and see what happens. Then I’ll share my results with everyone. Thanks for your comment! </p>
<p> This was my mother’s chiffon cake…..To this day I still make it and I’m 79.. I also make it in a large round pan which is scalloped. I slice it and fill it with an Italian cream filling and topped with whipped cream. DELICIOUS. Try using vanilla extract in place of the lemon. I think the lemon flavor is best when you serve it plain with powered sugar on top. </p>
<p> That sounds delicious, I must try it one day! Thanks for your feedback and for stopping by my blog! </p>
<p> Hi Joan Martino, Could I please get a copy of your recipe including the Italian cream, I recently had this cake with the Italian cream in between but I was too embarrassed to ask the Nonna for the recipe. </p>
<p> Beautiful cake, no frills, just few good ingredients and a delectable flavor. I am a fan of those! </p>

The parmesan cheese in this recipe is completely optional. There’s not a lot added here. Just a few sprinkles at the end that will melt into the stew when the lid is placed on the pot for just a minute or two. Sometimes I add it. Sometimes I don’t. </p>
<p> This One Pan Italian Chicken has an amazing ensemble of flavors. It’s Kyle’s favorite chicken dish that I make. Although…. I think any meal that I make that comes adorned with Kalamata olives is a favorite dish of Kyle’s. You can serve this Mediterranean Chicken with either a side of noodles or serve it with light and fluffy mashed potatoes. We prefer it with mashed potatoes. They soak up the broth really well! </p>

<p> One Pan Orecchiette Pasta </p>
<p> "Every year when it's time to go back to school I get inundated with requests from students to post recipes that are super-easy, cost pennies, and require a bare minimum of kitchen equipment. This delicious orecchiette pasta recipe only has a handful of ingredients, is very cheap to make, and most importantly: only uses one pan or pot for the entire procedure." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil until onion is soft and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir sausage into onions; cook and stir until sausage is broken up and browned, 5 to 7 minutes. </p>
<p> Pour 1 1/2 cups chicken broth into sausage mixture and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add orecchiette pasta; cook and stir pasta in hot broth, adding remaining broth when liquid is absorbed, until pasta is cooked through and most of the broth is absorbed, about 15 minutes. </p>
<p> Stir arugula into pasta-sausage mixture until arugula wilts. Ladle pasta into bowls and dust with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. </p>

<p> Oven Baked Bone-In Pork Chops Recipe </p>
<p> Oven Baked Bone-In Pork Chops Recipe – juicy, tender pork chops, seasoned with flavorful four ingredient dry rub and quickly baked in the oven to perfection. </p>
<p> A quick, simple and effortless weeknight meal for busy people. Thin cut bone in pork chops baked in the oven. Without marinating. No fancy seasoning. And no searing. A guide on how to prep, season and bake pork chops. </p>
<p> These baked pork chops are served with a side of baked green beans, but any vegetable of your choice can be added instead of green beans. </p>
<p> It is not a secret that I use pork in my recipes quite often, I cook with it at least once a week. </p>
<p> Most cuts of pork, like these bone-in pork chops cook fast, combine well with various seasonings and sides and also taste delicious. </p>
<p> What ingredients do I need to make baked bone-in pork chops? </p>
<p> bone-in pork chops (about 1 inch or less thickness) </p>
<p> salt for seasoning, may need more than the recommended amount in the recipe </p>
<p> pepper </p>
<p> onion powder </p>
<p> paprika </p>
<p> oil </p>
<p> How long does it take to make baked pork chops? </p>
<p> This Oven Baked Bone-In Pork Chops Recipe is ready in 30 minutes total, including preparation, baking and resting time. </p>
<p> So easy to make, with minimal prep work and minimal ingredients. </p>
<p> Serve these chops with a side salad, mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables. </p>
<p> I personally love the combination of green beans and pork, so I baked some green beans in the oven together with the pork chops. </p>
<p> This created the perfect sheet pan dinner for any day of the week. </p>
<p> Can you grill pork chops with bones? </p>
<p> I chose to bake these pork chops, but you can also grill them. It is still quite cold around here, this is why I have not started grilling yet. </p>
<p> Grill pork chops on medium-high for 4-5 minutes per side, until the internal temperature is 145 F. </p>
<p> What seasoning to use for pork chops? </p>
<p> You can marinade or dry rub the chops. </p>
<p> Since I’m usually busy, have limited time and often times I don’t even realize that it is 5 o’clock already, so I have to quickly make dinner, I just use olive (or vegetable) oil and dry spices. </p>
<p> I used: </p>
<p> salt </p>
<p> pepper </p>
<p> onion powder </p>
<p> and paprika (a mix of smoked and regular paprika tastes delicious!) </p>
<p> You can also add cumin, oregano, dried parsley, some garlic, cayenne pepper or any other seasoning of your choice. </p>
<p> I brush the pork chops with oil, then add the seasoning on both sides and bake. </p>
<p> How to cook bone-in pork chops? </p>
<p> How do you make tender pork chops? </p>
<p> I personally prefer the oven baked method, but you can also grill or pan fry them. Time for cooking depends on the thickness and method of cooking you choose. </p>
<p> Pork chops are considered safe for consumption if the internal temperature of the meat has reached 145 F. </p>
<p> Marinating Pork Chops </p>
<p> These baked bone in pork chops are quickly seasoned and baked, but if you’d like to take the extra step, you can marinate them. For thinner cuts of pork that also contain the bone, I rarely marinate. I like this technique for thicker cut, boneless pork chops, because they generally lack the flavor bone-in pork chops do. </p>
<p> Why do I prefer to cook these pork chops in the oven? </p>
<p> Because they cook quickly and stay juicy. </p>
<p> With grilling and pan frying you have the risk of the meat drying and turning into something very hard to chew. </p>
<p> How long do you bake pork chops in the oven for? </p>
<p> It depends on the kind of oven and pan used, but also the thickness of the meat, but I usually bake pork chops at 400 F for 15-20 minutes. </p>
<p> You can turn them once half way through, but you can also let them roast without turning. </p>
<p> What temperature should I cook pork chops to? </p>
<p> The internal temperature of the meat should be 145F and you need to let the chops rest for 3 minutes, before serving. </p>
<p> What to serve these oven baked bone-in pork chops with? </p>
<p> For the baked green beans – I used frozen (defrosted ) green beans, that I seasoned with salt and pepper and baked in the oven at the same time with the meat. </p>
<p> The only thing is that you do need to keep an eye on the green beans and remove them from the oven if they are done before the chops. </p>
<p> I usually remove them at the same time, but in some cases the beans may cook faster than the meat. </p>

<p> Oven Baked Bone-In Pork Chops Recipe - juicy, tender pork chops, seasoned with flavorful four ingredient dry rub and quickly baked in the oven to perfection. </p>
<p> For the green beans: </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 400F. </p>
<p> Brush the pork chops with oil, reserving 1 tbsp of it for the green beans. </p>
<p> In a small bowl, combine salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika. Season the bone-in pork chops with the seasoning. Place on a baking sheet. Add the green beans on the side, drizzle with oil, season with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Bake pork chops and green beans for 15-20 minutes, until the internal temperature of the pork reaches 145F. The green beans should be soft and cooked through. You may need to take out of the oven the green beans first, if they cook faster and continue cooking the pork. </p>
<p> Let the pork chops rest for 3 minutes, then serve. </p>
<p> Recipe Notes </p>
<p> Nutritional info includes the side green beans. </p>
<p> You do not need to turn the chops while cooking, but if you prefer, turn them once half way through. </p>

<p> made this for lunch just now, perfect timing + temp for the chop, it came out so juicy. I had it with brussels sprouts and potatoes, cause it’s what I had. Also, I added some gochugaru, a Korean spice, to give the meat a little kick. Thanks for the post and recipe! </p>
<p> So glad you liked them! </p>
<p> How thick are the chops that you use for this recipe? </p>
<p> They are 1/3 inch to 1/2 inch thick. For thicker cuts, you need to cook them extra time. </p>
<p> Very good recipe. Chops nice and moist which is always an issue for me when I make them </p>
<p> When baking the pork chops do you cover them with foil? </p>
<p> No, I don’t cover them. </p>
<p> I would NEVER shop at Walmart! The recipe is very good. I used pot chops from Staters. They are s local chain that pays well and gives health insurance to their employees. </p>
<p> Glad you liked the recipe Helen 🙂 </p>
<p> Why bring up Walmart </p>
<p> Please shop at any store you like. </p>
<p> I’m with you on never shopping at Walmart! Just put the chips and beans in the oven. </p>
<p> I never made baked pork chops in the oven before. These were fantastic and so easy! I didn’t use the paprika, but I will next time. pork chops were 1/2 inch thick. Seasoned with pepper, salt and onion powder after putting olive oil on the chops. placed on cookie sheet for 10 minutes a side @ 400 degrees. Perfect! </p>
<p> Hi Kathi, so glad the recipe worked for you and you liked these 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi hun, you may consider revising this portion “I don’t even realize that it is 5 o’cock already” perhaps change it to o’clock! Great recipe though! </p>
<p> Thanks! It was corrected. </p>

<p> Pizza prepared with sliced rolled pancetta with capicola (pancetta coppata) </p>
<p> Pancetta (Italian pronunciation: [panˈtʃetta]) is a salumi made of pork belly meat that is salt cured. Pancetta in Italy is typically cooked to add depth to soups and pastas.[1] </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> For cooking, it is often cut into cubes (cubetti di pancetta).[2] In Italy, pancetta is commonly served as a cold cut, sliced thin and eaten raw. It can also be used in carbonara pasta (although guanciale is generally regarded as more traditional).[3] </p>
<p> The two basic types of pancetta are the arrotolata (rolled) and stesa (flat). The arrotolata, salted, is mainly cut in thin slices and eaten raw as part of antipasti or simply as a component of a sandwich; the stesa is often used chopped as an ingredient in many recipes, or cut in thick strips, that are usually eaten grilled. There is also a version of arrotolata, to which capicola is added in the center of the roll (pancetta coppata). </p>
<p> The rolled type is typical of northern Italy,[4] while the flattened type is typical of central and southern Italy.[5] </p>
<p> While most pancetta is salt cured and dried, pancetta affumicata is salt cured and smoked, similar to bacon.[1] </p>
<p> The pork belly skin is removed before the pork is salted and held in a tub of brine for 10–14 days in a low temperature and high humidity environment. The brine is usually composed of salt, nitrite, ascorbate, spices such as black pepper, chilli, garlic, juniper, and rosemary, and sometimes nitrate. </p>
<p> After salting and brining, the pork is rolled, with layers of fat on the outside surrounding a meaty core. The rolled pork is then tightly packed into nettings or other fibrous casings. Rolling produces pancetta's distinctive shape, while the casing prevent case hardening in the latter stages of the production process. </p>
<p> Following rolling and packing, the pork undergoes enzymatic reactions facilitated by exposure to a warm environment of 22–24 °C for 24 to 36 hours. It is simultaneously exposed to cold smokes for desirable colours and flavours and to prevent moulding. </p>
<p> Finally, the smoked pork is held at 12–14 °C and 72–75% relative humidity for 3–4 weeks for drying. The resulting pancetta retains approximately 70% of its original weight.[8] </p>
<p> Pancetta is preserved by curing.[9] Curing is done using a spice and salt mixture containing nitrates or nitrites, which act to extend the shelf life of cured meats. Nitrates help remove excess moisture from the pork, decreasing water activity and limiting available free water for the growth of spoilage-causing and pathogenic microorganisms. Sodium nitrites are used to prevent the growth of botulism-causing bacteria and listeria monocytogenes, as well as imparting desirable flavour and colour.[10] Nitrates are said to act like time-released nitrites, and are used in pancetta products that require longer periods of curing and drying.[10] </p>
<p> Other constituents of the spice mixture also act to preserve the shelf life of pancetta—black pepper acts as an antibiotic, and sodium erythorbate is used as an antioxidant. </p>
<p> Pancetta kept in its original packaging can be stored for up to 12 months.[11] After opening, it has a shelf life of around 2–3 weeks in the refrigerator and up to 3 months in the freezer.[12] </p>
<p> One 30-g serving of pancetta contains around 5.0 g of protein, 11.0 g of fat, and 20–25 mg of cholesterol. One serving comprises between 15 and 22 percent of the accepted daily value of fats.[13][14] Despite its high portion of daily fat value, pancetta has a lower fat content than other bacon products.[15] </p>
<p> A single serving of pancetta contains around 540 mg of sodium.[13][14] Consumption of processed meats is reported to be the second largest source of dietary sodium consumption, with bacon products leading processed pork products in sodium content.[16] </p>
<p> Pancetta contains trace amounts of carbohydrates and no dietary fibre. These values can vary depending on processing, curing, and cooking methods. </p>
<p> Leading cancer research centres, including the World Cancer Research Fund and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have consistently linked high intakes of red and processed meats to increased mortality[17] and increased risk of various cancers, including colorectal and colon cancers.[18][19] A meta-analysis from 2011 showed that the risk of colorectal cancer increased 17% per 100 g daily consumption of red meat and by 18% per 50 g daily consumption of processed meat.[20] </p>
<p> A 2013 study found a positive correlation between high consumption of processed meat and higher all-cause mortality, and concluded that 3.3% of deaths could be prevented if processed meat consumption was reduced to 20 g/day or less.[17] </p>
<p> Associated cancer risk is likely related to the presence of nitrosamines in processed meat products like pancetta. Nitrosamines are carcinogenic compounds formed by the reaction of nitrites and amines.[21][22][18] Nitrites are added during processing to act as preservatives and as antibacterial agents against clostridium botulinum, the toxin that causes botulism. Amines are naturally-occurring compounds found in meats.[22] Nitrosamines are often formed in high temperatures,[23] like those required to produce bacon, one processed meat in which nitrosamines have been consistently found.[22] </p>
<p> Nitrosamines have also been shown to play a part in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as type 1 and 2 diabetes.[24] </p>
<p> Under Canadian regulations (C.R.C., Annex C.2), a cured meat product like pancetta is defined as an edible meat product that is prepared with salt with at least 100ppm of sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite, sodium nitrate, or potassium nitrate.[25] </p>
<p> In the United States, under the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA, hormones are not allowed in hogs or poultry raised for food. Pork or poultry sold in the U.S. must be labelled as hormone-free and include a statement saying that federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones.[26] </p>
<p> In the European Union, the labelling of pancetta is regulated under the protected designation of origin regime. Only pancetta produced in the Italian region of Calabria may be labelled as pancetta di calabria.[27] </p>

<p> It is often served dusted with vanilla-scented icing sugar made to resemble the snowy peaks of the Italian Alps during Christmas. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> Pandoro appeared in remote times, the product of the ancient art of breadmaking, as the name, pan d'oro (literally: 'golden bread'), suggests. Throughout the Middle Ages, white bread was consumed solely by the rich, while the common people could only afford black bread and, often, not even that. Sweet breads were reserved for nobility. Breads enriched with eggs, butter, and sugar or honey were served in the palaces and were known as royal bread or golden bread. </p>
<p> The desserts consumed in the 17th century were described in the book Suor Celeste Galilei, Letters to Her Father, published by La Rosa of Turin, and they included "royal bread" made from flour, sugar, butter and eggs. However, the bread was already known and appreciated in the ancient Rome of Pliny the Elder, in the 1st century. That bread was made with "the finest flour combined with eggs, butter and oil". Virgil and Livy mentioned the preparation under the name Libum. </p>
<p> The first citation of a dessert clearly identified as pandoro dates to the 18th century. The dessert certainly figured in the cuisine of the Venetian aristocracy. Venice was the principal market for spices as late as the 18th century, as well as for the sugar that by then had replaced honey in European pastries and breads made from leavened dough. And it was at Verona, in Venetian territory, that the formula for making pandoro was developed and perfected, a process that required a century. The modern history of this dessert bread began at Verona on October 30, 1894, when Domenico Melegatti obtained a patent for a procedure to be applied in producing pandoro industrially. </p>

<p> It has a cupola shape, which extends from a cylindrical base and is usually about 12–15 cm high for a panettone weighing 1 kg. Other bases may be used, such as an octagon, or a frustum with a star section shape more common to pandoro. It is made during a long process that involves curing the dough, which is acidic, similar to sourdough. The proofing process alone takes several days, giving the cake its distinctive fluffy characteristics. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked. Many other variations are available such as plain or with chocolate. It is served in wedge shapes, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine, such as Asti or Moscato d'Asti. In some regions of Italy, it is served with crema di mascarpone, a cream made from mascarpone, eggs, sometimes dried or candied fruits, and typically a sweet liqueur such as amaretto; if mascarpone cheese is unavailable, zabaione is sometimes used as a substitute. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> In Italy, panettone comes with an often varied history, but one that invariably states that its birthplace was Milan. The word "panettone" derives from the Italian word "panetto", a small loaf cake. The augmentative Italian suffix "-one" changes the meaning to "large cake". </p>
<p> The origins of this cake appear to be ancient, dating back to the Roman Empire, when ancient Romans sweetened a type of leavened cake with honey.[7] </p>
<p> Throughout the ages, this "tall, leavened fruitcake" makes cameo appearances in the arts: It is shown in a sixteenth-century painting[citation needed] by Pieter Brueghel the Elder and is possibly mentioned in a contemporary recipe book written by Italian Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to popes and emperors during the time of Charles V. The first recorded association of panettone with Christmas can be found in the Italian writings of 18th century illuminist Pietro Verri. He refers to it as "Pan de Ton" (luxury bread).[8] </p>
<p> Though the etymology of the word 'panettone' is rather mundane, three more complex and fanciful folk etymologies have arisen.[9] It is also thought that one of the ecclesiastical brothers, Fr. Antonio, who always wore the proper hat, was fond of this "pane". The ecclesiastical hat Pane Tone was later adopted as the shape, which gave rise to Panettone. This derivation received credence and acceptability at the turn of the century, and is likely to be the forerunner of the more recent Christmas cake.[citation needed] Gianrian Carli in "Il Caffè" makes passing reference to panettone in 1850 in discussion with Pietro Verri and alludes to a clerical hat. </p>
<p> One theory suggests that the word derives from the Milanese, "pan del ton", meaning "cake of luxury". </p>
<p> In the early 20th century, two enterprising Milanese bakers began to produce panettone in large quantities for the rest of Italy. In 1919, Angelo Motta started producing his eponymous brand of cakes. It was also Motta who revolutionised the traditional panettone by giving it its tall domed shape by making the dough rise three times, for almost 20 hours, before cooking, giving it its now-familiar light texture. The recipe was adapted shortly after by another baker, Gioacchino Alemagna, around 1925, who also gave his name to a popular brand that still exists today.[citation needed] The stiff competition between the two that then ensued led to industrial production of the cake. Nestlé took over the brands together in the late 1990s, but Bauli,[10] an Italian bakery company based in Verona, has acquired Motta and Alemagna from Nestlé.[11] </p>
<p> By the end of World War II, panettone was cheap enough for anyone and soon became the country's leading Christmas sweet. Lombard immigrants to Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela and Brazil also brought their love of panettone, and panettone is enjoyed for Christmas with hot cocoa or liquor during the holiday season, which became a mainstream tradition in those countries. In some places, it replaces the king cake. </p>
<p> Panettone is widely available in South America, including in Argentina, Brazil, Chile (see: Pan de Pascua), Ecuador, Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru. It is known in Spanish as panetón or pan dulce, and as panetone in Brazilian Portuguese. Peru's Antonio D'Onofrio, son of immigrants hailing from Caserta, Italy, spawned his own brand using a modified form of the Alemagna formula (e.g., candied papaya is used instead of candied citron and lemon, as these fruits are not available in Peru), which he licensed along with the packaging style. This brand is now also owned by Nestlé and exported throughout South America. In recent years, Brazilian panetone have increased in quality and in popularity due to their low cost and abundance. </p>
<p> Italian food manufacturing companies and bakeries produce 117 million panettone and pandoro cakes every Christmas, collectively worth 579 million euros.[12] There is an event held in Milan since 2013 that awards the Best Traditional Panettone of Italy. In 2016, the prize was awarded to Giuseppe Zippo, from Salento. </p>
<p> Panettone is popular within Italian communities around the world, and can commonly be found in Italian grocery stores in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK. </p>

<p> Classic Italian Panettone </p>
<p> Elaine Lemm is a renowned British food writer, classically trained chef, teacher, and author with over 25 years of experience writing about British food and cooking. </p>
<p> Thick slices of soft, warm Italian panettone slathered in salty butter are the kind of treats that Christmas is all about. It's a typical Christmas cake throughout Italy and in Italian communities around the world, but it comes from the northern Italian city of Milan. A panettone—which literally translates to "big loaf"—is a large, dome-shaped cake that has been leavened with yeast. It has a slightly light and airy texture, but a rich and buttery taste, and is not very sweet. </p>
<p> The classic Italian panettone is a real beauty and making one is not as difficult as some would have you believe. There are long, drawn-out recipes involving much rising, kneading, and rising again and again. The result, of course, is lovely, but it doesn't need to be so involved, as this more straightforward recipe shows. </p>
<p> 9 ounces unsalted butter, plus 1 tablespoon for greasing (room temperature) </p>
<p> 1 ounce whole almonds (blanched) </p>
<p> Steps to Make It </p>
<p> Note: While there are multiple steps to this recipe, this panettone is broken down into workable categories to help you better plan for preparation and cooking. </p>
<p> Prepare the Fruit </p>
<p> Gather your ingredients. </p>
<p> Put all the dried candied fruits into a bowl and mix thoroughly. </p>
<p> Pour over the Cointreau, mix again, then cover and put to one side in a cool place—but not in the refrigerator—to soak overnight. </p>
<p> Prepare the Dough </p>
<p> In a heatproof jug or bowl, sprinkle the dried yeast over the 5 ounces of warmed milk, stir in the sugar, and leave to one side for 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Tip the flour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Sprinkle the salt into one side of the bowl; on the other side, pour in the frothy yeast mixture. The salt should never come into direct contact with yeast, dried or fresh as the salt will kill the yeast and your bread will be hard and heavy. </p>
<p> Start by mixing on a slow speed to combine the ingredients. Add 5 of the eggs, turn the mixer to medium speed and continue mixing until the dough smooths out. It will also become quite sticky. </p>
<p> Cut the softened butter into bite-sized chunks, raise the speed of the mixer and add the butter a few pieces at a time until you have used up all it. </p>
<p> Let the mixer continue to run for at least 5 more minutes. The dough will turn glossy and even smoother and so soft that it will be impossible to handle. Don't worry though, at this point you don’t need to, and to preserve the air in the dough, it's best that you don’t. </p>
<p> Grease a large baking bowl with the remaining butter. </p>
<p> Hold the stand mixer bowl over the greased one and allow the mixed dough to slowly slide into it. Avoid forcing it out and merely let the dough move by its weight. This way you will retain maximum air in the dough. </p>
<p> Scrape down any leftover dough with a soft spatula. Cover the bowl with a lid or tightly with plastic wrap and put into a very cool place, preferably the fridge if you have room and leave overnight. The next day the dough should be bursting from the bowl and full of lovely bubbles of air. </p>
<p> Make the Panettone </p>
<p> Heavily flour a work surface, carefully tip the dough out of the bowl, and spread it out with your fingertips. All the air will whoosh out, but it will rise again. Still, don't be too heavy-handed while handling the dough. </p>
<p> Strain the soaked fruits through a fine sieve, discarding the juice, and place half of the fruits onto the spread out dough. </p>
<p> Fold the dough over the fruits and lightly roll the dough around to distribute the fruit evenly through the dough. </p>
<p> Spread the dough again and repeat as before with the remaining fruit. The dough will be lumpy and knobbly, but look it over to make sure the fruits are not clustered in any one area, if they are, give them another roll around. </p>
<p> Form the dough into a roughly shaped ball. </p>
<p> Grease a 7-inch panettone tin or panettone paper case with butter. If you have neither of these, use a regular cake tin, but line the base and sides with greaseproof paper standing at least 2 inches above the rim. </p>
<p> Drop the dough into the center of the tin, tuck the almonds into the surface of the cake, and cover loosely with a tea cloth. </p>
<p> Put the cake in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours until the dough once more is well risen and rising above the tin; it takes longer then allow it to, the key here is to have the rise above the rim of the tin or case. </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 350 F. </p>
<p> Mix the remaining egg with the 3 tablespoons of milk and brush over the surface of the cake. Cook in the middle of the oven for 20 minutes. Lower the heat to 300 F and cook for a further 40 minutes. The panettone is ready when a skewer comes out clean. </p>
<p> Let the cake cool for 5 minutes in the tin on a cooling rack, then remove and leave it to cool completely. </p>
<p> Serve and enjoy! </p>
<p> Tips </p>
<p> The cake is delicious eaten fresh (with lots of butter) and keeps well in an airtight tin for a week. It also freezes well for up to two months; defrost slowly in the refrigerator overnight. </p>
<p> This easy recipe makes the most of the stand mixer for the kneading, if you do not have one, then knead by hand. </p>
<p> The long, slow rise overnight will give you the lightest of cakes. Do not be tempted to rush this process by putting the cake into a too-warm place; if you do, the cake will rise but collapse in the oven. Slower is always better and results is a light airy cake, with a soft crumb. </p>
<p> Recipe Variations </p>
<p> Soaking the fruit in Cointreau—or any liqueur you prefer—packs in the flavor, but even without it, the panettone will be delicious. If alcohol is not your thing, or the cake is for children, then substitute the Cointreau with orange juice; apple juice also works very well. </p>
<p> The recipe above is for the classic combinations of fruits and thereby flavor. You can choose the fruits in any proportion you prefer. </p>
<p> Switch out the almonds on the top of the cake for walnuts or cashews or leave out the nuts altogether and sprinkle with pearl sugar. </p>
<p> I don't like this at all. It's not the worst. Sure, this will do. I'm a fan—would recommend. Amazing! I love it! Thanks for your rating! </p>

<p> The best tender and juicy Pan Fried Pork Chops recipe! With only 5 simple ingredients and 15 minutes, you can turn underrated pork chops into a scrumptious dinner that rivals the best steak. By following a few easy tips, you can forget about dry and tough chops forever! </p>
<p> Never make a dry pork chop again </p>
<p> Pork chops are such a lean cut that they’re prone to overcooking. After many experiments, we’ve cracked the code on how to easily make them tender every single time. 100% guaranteed! Say goodbye to tough and dried-out pork chops! </p>
<p> The best part? These stove top pork chops use no flour, meaning there’s no dredging or deep frying so they’re healthier with far less calories. This recipe is budget-friendly, paleo, gluten-free and keto! </p>
<p> Watch the video to see how easy it is to make this recipe: </p>
<p> How to fry pork chops on the stove </p>
<p> Remove pork chops from the fridge 15-20 minutes before cooking. </p>
<p> Pat dry with paper towels. </p>
<p> Mix paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a small bowl. </p>
<p> Rub with olive oil and seasonings on all sides. </p>
<p> Place a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. </p>
<p> Once the pan is hot, add oil and pork chops. </p>
<p> Cook for 5-10 minutes in total depending on the thickness, flipping every minute. </p>
<p> Check doneness using an instant-read thermometer. </p>
<p> Remove the pork chops to a plate to rest for 5 minutes before serving. </p>
<p> Flipping multiple times in the skillet for the best results </p>
<p> It might sound counterintuitive, but our experiments prove that extra flipping is the secret to tender and juicy pork chops! </p>
<p> Flipping every minute prevents the exterior of your pork chops from overcooking or burning while you’re waiting for the interior to cook through. This way, you’ll get more evenly cooked meat with a nice and golden brown crust. </p>
<p> Why are my pork chops tough? </p>
<p> Overcooked pork chops are tough! </p>
<p> Pork chops cook quickly and are prone to overcooking. Even just a few minutes too long on the stovetop will make them tough and chewy. Did you know the temperature of your pork chops keeps rising even after they’re removed from the heat, a phenomenon called carryover cooking. </p>
<p> So knowing how long to cook your chops and when to remove from heat are the most important keys to avoiding dry-out pork chops! </p>
<p> How long to fry pork chops </p>
<p> Cooking times vary for thin vs. thick pork chops. Simply follow the cook time chart below for the chops you’re using: </p>
<p> Note: Times above are for room temperature chops. As kitchen equipment may vary in the amount of heat produced, it’s best to verify doneness using a thermometer instead of relying on time alone. </p>
<p> When are pork chops done frying? </p>
<p> Cook time and color are NOT accurate ways to measure doneness. </p>
<p> The most reliable way is by using an instant-read thermometer. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the chop (about an inch away from the bone for bone-in chops). As soon as the temperature reads 140°F (61°C), remove the pork chops to a plate to rest. The temperature will rise a few degrees more during resting to reach the final internal temperature of 145°F (63°C), </p>
<p> One of the biggest mistakes people make is to cook the meat until it’s completely white. Your pork chops will be overcooked by then. It’s OK if the meat appears slightly pink as long as the temperature reaches the desired level, since temperature (not color) is the safe indicator of pork doneness according to the USDA. </p>
<p> Tips: extra steps to take the tenderness to a new level </p>
<p> Look for fresh, high-quality pork chops that are plump with a nice pink color and some fat around the edges. </p>
<p> Thicker pork chops that are 1-1.5 inches thick are less likely to dry out than thin chops. </p>
<p> Bone-in pork chops are more tender and flavorful than boneless cuts. </p>
<p> Remove the chops from the fridge 15 minutes before cooking so the meat gets closer to room temperature for more even cooking. </p>
<p> I highly recommend brining the chops before cooking. Just place your chops in the salt and water mixture (1/4 cup of salt + 4 cups of water). A quick 30 minutes brine makes a big difference. </p>
<p> Season generously with salt and other seasonings. I use a simple dry rub consisting of garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Let the pork chops rest covered for about 5 minutes after cooking to let the juices retreat back into the meat. </p>
<p> Pan Fried Pork Chops Recipe (+Video) </p>
<p> These Pan Fried Pork Chops are a scrumptious pork chop recipe that’ll be on your dinner table in 15 minutes using just 5 ingredients. </p>
<p> Cook Time: 10 mins </p>
<p> Total Time: 15 mins </p>
<p> Servings: 4 </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 1 teaspoon black pepper, coarsely ground </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Remove the pork chops from the fridge 15-20 minutes before cooking to approach room temperature for even cooking and juicier chops. </p>
<p> Pat dry the chops with paper towels to remove excess moisture. </p>
<p> Rub the chops on all sides with 1 tablespoon of oil. </p>
<p> In a small bowl, combine garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper. </p>
<p> Rub the seasoning mixture on all sides of each pork chop. </p>
<p> Place a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. </p>
<p> Once the pan is hot and the oil is shimmering, add the pork chops. </p>
<p> Fry for 7-8 minutes for 1-inch thick pork chops, flipping every minute to prevent overheating. For other thicknesses, see recipe notes*. </p>
<p> Insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the chop. When it reads 140°F (61°C), the pork chops are done***. </p>
<p> Remove the chops to a plate and rest for 5 minutes covered with foil or a plate. This is to let the juices retreat back into the meat for juicier chops. </p>
<p> Garnish with optional minced parsley and serve. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> * Cook 4-6 minutes for 3/4 inch thick chops; 8-10 minutes for 1 1/4 inch thickness; 10-12 minutes for 1 1/2 inch thickness. </p>
<p> **If you brine your chops, then reduce the salt by at least half. </p>
<p> ***It's ok if the center of your pork chop is slightly pink after cooking, as long as the internal temperature reaches 140°F (61°C). The temperature will keep rising to the safe level of 145°F (63°C) while resting. </p>
<p> I love this blend of seasonings. Perfect for bringing out the flavor of the pork! </p>
<p> This recipe is awesome. So easy and quick, and the pork chops stay juicy without brining. Thank you!! </p>
<p> //Recipe says to “bake” for 15 minutes. However this is a recipe for “pan-fried” pork chops. Am I missing something here? Thanks. </p>
<p> Hi Shirley, That was a typo – sorry about that. It’s been corrected, so hopefully you’ll try the recipe! 🙂 </p>
<p> I’m confused it says to bake them in the recipe. Reading the top comment you say they are pan fried. How long do you pan fry them on each side? </p>
<p> Hi Tina, Sorry there were some typos that have been corrected. Hope you get a chance to try it now 🙂 </p>
<p> Lovely pork chops recipe! We tried it last night, is was very flavorful and quick to make. </p>
<p> Instruction 3 says “Bake for about 15 minutes or the internal temperature reaches 145F.” </p>

<p> Pan-Fried Salmon with Pasta Recipe </p>
<p> TRADITIONAL ITALIAN RECIPE: While my enthusiasm for cooking has grown immensely over the past few years, I still feel mostly reluctant to toss my personal recipe books aside and approach the task with new original ideas and ingredients when it comes to traditional dishes like this one. </p>
<p> Everything can be easily made in about 30 minutes or less, which makes it a brilliant, balanced meal for those busy week nights. </p>
<p> Salmon is rich in Omega-3. Everyone heard about Omega-3 and we see all types of fish oil available at the pharmacy. </p>
<p> But what is Omega-3? </p>
<p> Omega-3 fatty acids (also known as n-3 or ω−3) are a family of unsaturated fatty acids include α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The health benefits of Omega-3 were discovered in the 1970s: virtually no one from the Greenland Inuit Tribe have any cardiovascular disease. Why? It is because they eat large amount of seafood! There is now strong evidence showing that Omega-3 reduce levels of blood triglyceride (fatty material circulating in blood) and VLDL (aka “bad cholesterol”) as well as reduce the risk of heart attacks. Preliminary studies also show that Omega-3 might be helpful in treating depression and anxiety. There are also debates going on about the anti-cancer effects (particularly breast, colon and prostate cancer). So eat more salmon now! </p>
<p> ( you can use Oregano, Thyme, Basil, Dill or Parsley ) </p>
<p> Salt and Pepper </p>
<p> Directions: </p>
<p> 01 - Gently wash the Salmon Fillets in tap water for a few seconds, dry them on kitchen paper and season lightly with Salt and Pepper. </p>
<p> 02 - Boil a big pot of salted water and start cooking the Pasta. </p>
<p> For the Sauce: </p>
<p> 03 - Heat over medium heat the Butter in a small saucepan. </p>
<p> 04 - Mix in the Garlic and gently stir until the Garlic turns light-brown. </p>
<p> 05 - Add fresh Herbs, Lemon Juice and cook for 1 extra minute. </p>
<p> 06 - Turn off the heat and leave the Butter Sauce aside. </p>
<p> For the Salmon: </p>
<p> 07 - Using another frying pan, heat the Olive Oil over medium heat and cook the Salmon for 5 minutes. </p>
<p> 08 - Mix the cooked Salmon with the Butter Sauce mixture and cook over a very low heat till the Pasta is ready. </p>
<p> 09 - Drain the Pasta and mix it with the Salmon and the Sauce. Serve. </p>

<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 3 TBS chicken stock </p>
<p> 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice </p>
<p> Instructions: </p>
<p> In a small bowl, whisk together oil, Rosemary, thyme, garlic paste and a pinch of salt. Allow the flavors to mingle for 15-30 minutes. </p>
<p> Pat chops dry and season well with salt and black pepper. Pour marinade over top the chops, and rub it in all over. Allow chops marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes. </p>
<p> Heat a large cast iron or heavy nonstick pan over med-high heat, once it’s hot add 1 TBS of olive oil to the pan, once it begins to shimmer, like little ripples of water, add the chops, scraping any of the marinade into the pan as well. </p>
<p> Pan-fry the chops, turning them once or twice until internal temperature in the thickest part of the chop registers 145 degrees or done to your liking (remember the meat will continue to cook after it's removed from the pan). Place chops onto a plate. </p>
<p> Deglaze your pan with the wine, scraping up any browned bits with a spatula. Add in the stock, lemon, and butter and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. </p>
<p> Season with salt and pepper and allow the sauce to continue boiling to reduce it for a few minutes. </p>
<p> Plate chops, spooning sauce over top. </p>
<p> Garnish with a lemon slice and/or thyme sprigs. </p>
<p> Notes: </p>
<p> The oil from the marinade should be enough to pan-fry the chops. If not, add in small amounts of olive oil throughout the cooking process as needed. </p>
<p> If you enjoy a thicker sauce, spoon out 1-2 tablespoons of the sauce into a small bowl and whisk with a ¼ tablespoon or so of cornstarch, stirring to combine. Return that to the pan and whisk constantly until fully incorporated and thickened. </p>

<p> You don't have to spend a lot of money to cook a delicious steak dinner. Petite sirloin steaks are less expensive than many other cuts, but still give you a tender, beefy bite. Keep an eye on the time when you’re pan-frying the steak, though; overcooked sirloin ends up being tough and chewy. The process is simple -- all you need is a screaming hot pan and a little seasoning. Beyond that, successful pan-fried steaks only need to be timed carefully and cut against the grain to prevent chewiness. </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Season the steak with kosher salt at least 40 minutes before cooking. This is the minimum amount of time that the salt needs to do its job of breaking down some of the meat's muscle tissue and allowing the juices and salt to be absorbed into the meat. </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Remove the steak from the refrigerator roughly 30 minutes before cooking and let it sit at room temperature; this ensures even cooking. Pat it with paper towels to make sure it's dry. If there's too much moisture on the steak's surface, it won't sear properly. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Rub a little olive oil, or your favorite cooking oil, on both sides of the petite sirloin before seasoning it with a sprinkle of salt and black pepper. </p>
<p> Step 4 </p>
<p> Turn the stove on to medium-high heat. Place a cast-iron skillet or a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan onto the stove's burner. Avoid using a nonstick pan, since it won't get hot enough and shouldn't be used at the high temperature you need to sear the steak.Once you can feel the heat when you hold your hand above the pan, add cooking oil to the pan. </p>
<p> Step 5 </p>
<p> Add the sirloin steak to the pan and let it cook for two to three minutes before flipping the steak with tongs. Allow the steak to cook for another two to three minutes before removing it from the pan and transferring it to a cutting board. </p>
<p> Step 6 </p>
<p> Cover the sirloin with foil and let it rest for about 10 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute before you serve it. </p>
<p> Check the steak for doneness with an instant-read thermometer. According to the USDA, for safety's sake, it should be at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit -- for medium-rare steak -- when it's inserted in the thickest part of the meat. If you prefer a medium steak, wait until the thermometer reads 160 degrees F to remove it. </p>

<p> More Articles </p>
<p> Thick cuts of pork can be challenging because, while it is important to cook all pork to a safe temperature, over-cooking pork makes it dry out and get tough. Pan-frying is an excellent choice for thicker cuts of pork because the higher heat cooks them quickly, retaining their juiciness. Pan-frying also gives pork a crisp, brown outer crust that adds to the overall flavor. Don’t be alarmed if your pork is still a little pink when it comes out of the pan. Trust your instant-read thermometer to judge when your pork is done. </p>
<p> Blot your pork chop or pork steak with a clean paper towel, to dry the surface and help it brown properly. </p>
<p> Season both sides of the pork with coarse salt and cracked pepper. As the pork cooks, the spices will infuse the meat with a bit of extra flavor. You can add other spices to the rub, such as lemon pepper, garlic powder, sage or thyme, if you prefer. </p>
<p> Coat the bottom of a skillet with a film of oil. Olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil and peanut oil will all work with this cooking method, so choose the oil you use according its flavor. </p>
<p> Heat the oil over medium-high heat until a visible shimmer develops across its surface. </p>
<p> Add the pork to the oil. Cook the steaks or chops for five to seven minutes, depending on their thickness and on what level of doneness you prefer. </p>
<p> Turn the pork with tongs to avoid poking holes in it. That will help keep the tenderizing juices inside of the pork from leaking out. </p>
<p> Cover the pork and cook it for another three to five minutes. </p>
<p> Check the internal temperature by poking an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the pork. If you are cooking a bone-in chop, make sure the tip of the thermometer does not touch the bone. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends cooking pork to a minimum safe temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit for rare pork. Meat continues to cook while it rests, and the temperature can go up as much as another 10 degrees. So for rare pork, take it off of the heat when it reaches 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit and add 10 degrees for each level of doneness. </p>
<p> Let the pork rest for five to 10 minutes after removing it from the pan. Cover it with aluminum foil if you want to help the temperature rise and keep the pork hot. </p>
<p> Add a thin layer of mixed water and wine or broth to the skillet before covering it to add moisture. </p>
<p> Warnings </p>
<p> Never judge whether pork is safely cooked by looking at it, because it can be pink in the center both when it is undercooked and when it is done. </p>

<p> Pan-Seared Tuscan Lamb Chops </p>
<p> Apr 2, 2020 by Whitney Reist As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. </p>
<p> Pan-Seared Tuscan Lamb Chops are my new go-to for dinner parties and special meals at home when I want something a little fancy! </p>
<p> When Ryan and I were visiting his family for Christmas in TX this past year, his mom made the most incredible lamb chops for dinner one night. They tasted so fabulous and we all felt like we were eating something from a fancy restaurant - the chops were tender, juicy, and exploding with flavor! Of course I had to know where she got them and how they were cooked so I could try and make them at home. So first things first and much to my delight, she bought the lamb chops from Costco! We've had a Costco membership for a year now and find the best quality meats and seafood there. And sure enough, the next time we visited the one in Nashville, the lamb chops were there just as Ryan's mom described. </p>
<p> She assured me that the cooking process was simple - just some basic seasoning of salt and pepper, pan searing in some olive oil, and finishing them off in the oven. I was so excited and couldn't wait to try it for myself. I knew the most challenging aspect would be avoiding overcooking, so of course I had my meat thermometer at the ready for my first attempt. I had made lamb dishes in the past - mostly with ground lamp or the really thin "lollipop-style" lamb chops. But these lamb loin chops were pretty thick - about 1 1/2 - 2 inches each, so I had to be careful. Read on to see exactly how I prepared them... </p>
<p> Pan-Seared Tuscan Lamb Chop Ingredients </p>
<p> Lamb loin chops - for this recipe, I purchased about 2 pounds worth of lamb loin chops from Costco. There is a bone in the center of the chop, and each is about 1 1/2 - 2 inches in thickness. Plan to serve 2 chops per person, and 3 for those with hearty appetites. </p>
<p> Olive oil - a clean, grassy olive oil is a great base for a lamb marinade, as it complements the unique flavor of lamb. And this is a recipe for TUSCAN lamb chops, so olive oil is a must! </p>
<p> Dijon mustard - a dab of Dijon in the marinade provides a hint of acidity that cuts through the richness of the lamb and enhances the flavor of the herbs. You won't taste the Dijon in the final dish, but it helps balance the overall flavor. </p>
<p> Fresh garlic, rosemary, thyme, and lemon zest - aromatic garlic, woodsey rosemary and thyme, and fresh lemon zest are commonly used together in Italian cooking and provide so much depth of flavor in a marinade. I always have these items on hand! </p>
<p> How to Pan-Sear Lamb Chops </p>
<p> Use a heavy-bottomed pan that is oven-safe - you want something that conducts heat evenly and can be transfered from the stovetop to oven. I love cast iron for this, and would recommend a good old-fashioned cast iron skillet or an enameled cast iron skillet or grill pan. </p>
<p> Combine butter and olive oil for searing - I love the way that the combo of butter and olive oil tastes on seared meats. It provides such a nice, golden-brown crust, and the flavor is incredible! I like to baste this mixture on the chops once I flip them to sear the other side. </p>
<p> Keep track of time - it's very crucial to set a timer so you can keep track of how long you sear the chops on each side, and how long they are in the oven. I recommend no more than 2 minutes per side, then a range of 4-6 minutes in the oven. </p>
<p> Make use of the stovetop and oven - when I worked in restaurants as part of my culinary training, the chef-favored way of cooking steaks or chops was to give them a quick sear on the cooktop and then finish them off at a high temperature in the oven. Thick meats tend to be raw in the center and overcooked on the outside when cooked on the stovetop for the entire time. Finishing them in the oven provides more even heat that circulates around the meat. </p>
<p> Use a meat thermometer - for the perfectly-cooked, medium-rare chop, you want the internal temperature to be 132 -135 degrees F when you remove it from heat. The only way to ensure it's cooked perfectly is to check the temperature as you time the chops in the oven. I like to stack two lamb chops together before inserting the probe so that I get a more accurate reading. Continue cooking in increments of 2 minutes until you reach the desired temperature. </p>
<p> Let them rest before cutting - 5-10 minutes of resting under loosely-tented foil allows the juices to redistribute throughout the muscle fibers of the chop. This ensures the juice won't all come out onto the plate when you cut the chop and that the meat stays moist throughout the thickness of the cut. </p>
<p> And there you have it! Keep these tips in mind when cooking your lamb chops and you are sure to have an amazingly tender and flavorful dish that will certainly impress your guests and loved ones! </p>
<p> Are you ready to try these Pan-Seared Tuscan Lamb Chops? I’m so excited for you to try this recipe. Once you get the chance to make it, please let me know how it turns out for you! Leave a comment and rate the recipe below. This will help me with the creation of future recipes! I’d also love to feature your creation in my monthly newsletter, so you can upload a photo to Instagram or Twitter with the tag @sweetcayenne5 to be featured! </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> In a shallow dish, combine the garlic, mustard, 3 tablespoons olive oil, herbs, and ½ teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Add the lamb chops and massage the mixture into both sides of each chop. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for a minimum of one hour and up to 8 hours. Try to flip the chops halfway to ensure even flavor throughout. </p>
<p> A half hour prior to cooking, let the chops sit out at room temperature for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425℉. Pat the chops dry with a paper towel, then season both sides of each chop with coarse salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the butter and remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Sear the lamb chops for exactly two minutes on each side. Use a spoon to baste the chops with the butter and oil from the pan once you flip them. Transfer the hot skillet to the oven and continue cooking for 4-6 minutes for medium rare or a thermometer inserted into the center of two chops stacked together reads 135℉. </p>
<p> Cover loosely with foil and let the chops rest for 5-10 minutes before serving hot. </p>

<p> Are saute and chef’s pans one and the same? They both have sloped sides and depth that make stirring easy. These make them suitable for stews, braised dishes and sauteed vegetables. Their lids also let you use them for simmering or boiling. What makes them unique is their handle. A saute pan typically has one main handle for effortless tossing. A chef’s pan, on the other hand, has two side handles. This makes the pan easier to “handle” when you’re cooking in volume.

<p> How to Make Pesto like an Italian Grandmother </p>
<p> If you've ever tasted pesto in Italy you know that the pesto here in the United States just isn't the same. I received a lesson in how to make pesto from a real Italian grandmother last week and now I understand the difference and what makes this pesto recipe so special. </p>
<p> A Special Pesto </p>
<p> My friend Francesca makes the trip from her small town near the pesto-epicenter of Genoa, Italy to San Francisco once or twice a year - this time (lucky for us) she brought her mom and two-year old son Mattia. Her mom makes a beautiful pesto (and perfectly light, potato gnocchi to go along with it) and offered to show me and my friend Jen how it is done. I have to say, it was a complete game-changer. If you love pesto, you really have to try this. Her technique results in an incredibly special pesto. </p>
<p> Chop by hand or blender? </p>
<p> Most of the pesto you encounter here in the U.S. is different for a few reasons. First off, most of what you see is made by machine, usually a food processor or hand blender. This holds true even if it is homemade. Don't get me wrong, it usually tastes good, but because the ingredients aren't hand chopped you end up with a texture that is more like like a moist paste and there little to no definition between ingredients. </p>
<p> During my lesson I quickly began to realize chopping all the ingredients by hand and not blending them is key because this prevents the ingredients from becoming a completely homogenized emulsion or paste. When you dress a pasta with a pesto that has been hand chopped the minuscule flecks of basil will separate from the olive oil in places, you get definition between ingredients, and bright flavors pop in a way they don't when they've been blended into one. </p>
<p> Choosing the right basil </p>
<p> Another thing, Genovese pesto is famous in part because it is often made with young, small basil leaves. For us non-Italians it is easy to find Genovese basil in stores and at farmer's markets particularly in the summer, but chances are it wasn't picked young. I wouldn't worry about it too much, simply by hand chopping all your ingredients, you will see a major shift in personality of your pesto. If you grow your own basil, I'm envious. </p>
<p> The technique </p>
<p> If you're serious about making good pesto, using this technique, get a good, sharp (preferably large, single blade) mezzaluna, or a good knife - you'll need it. Chopping the ingredients will take twenty minutes or so. Whatever you use to chop, make sure it has a sharp blade or the basil will turn dark. Once you chop your ingredients, you'll form them into a cake, pictured above. You add olive oil to this cake, and it's magic - below. </p>
<p> How to Store Pesto </p>
<p> Store any pesto you might use in the next day or two, refrigerated, under a thin film of olive oil. You can also freeze it in snack-sized baggies. Thaw and toss whatever gnocchi or pasta you like with it. </p>
<p> Let me know if you try this and what you think! Use your beautiful fresh pesto with this gnocchi recipe. Tutto bene! </p>
<p> How to Make Pesto like an Italian Grandmother </p>
<p> One key to perfect pesto is chopping all the ingredients by hand, preferably with a sharp mezzaluna or knife. This pesto will keep a bit in the refrigerator, but it really hits its peak when served soon after it is made. The technique here is: chop a bit, add some ingredients, chop some more. I think part of the reason she does it this way (instead of chopping everything all at once) is because some things get chopped into oblivion, while some, not as much - it encourages spectrum of cut sizes throughout the pesto contributing to the overall texture. All told, the chopping took me a leisurely twenty to thirty minutes, I wasn't in any particular rush. </p>
<p> You'll also notice this recipe doesn't have any added salt (just the saltiness from the cheese), make sure your pasta water is well salted if you are going to use this pesto on pasta or the overall flavor profile will fall flat. Also, be sure to adjust for seasoning before serving. With food this simple, you need to get the seasoning right. Trust your tastebuds. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 1 large bunch of basil, leaves only, washed and dried </p>
<p> 3 medium cloves of garlic </p>
<p> one small handful of raw pine nuts </p>
<p> roughly 3/4 cup Parmesan, loosely packed and freshly grated </p>
<p> A few tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil </p>
<p> Special equipment: a mezzaluna for chopping (optional) </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Chop Ingredients </p>
<p> Start chopping the garlic along with about 1/3 of the basil leaves. Once this is loosely chopped add more basil, chop some more, add the rest of the basil, chop some more. I scrape and chop, gather and chop. At this point the basil and garlic should be a very fine mince. Add about half the pine nuts, chop. Add the rest of the pine nuts, chop. Add half of the Parmesan, chop. Add the rest of the Parmesan, and chop. In the end you want a chop so fine that you can press all the ingredients into a basil "cake" - see the photo up above. Transfer the pesto "cake" to a small bowl (not much bigger than the cake). </p>
<p> Form a Paste </p>
<p> Cover the pesto "cake" with a bit of olive oil. It doesn't take much, just a few tablespoons. At this point, you can set the pesto aside, or place it in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it. Just before serving, give the pesto a quick stir to incorporate some of the oil into the basil. Francesca's mom occasionally thins the pesto with a splash of pasta water for more coverage, but for our gnocchi this wasn't necessary. </p>
<p> Related Recipes </p>
<p> The gnocchi recipe taught to me by Francesca's mother. A platter of petite, potato pillows coated with glistening flecks of basil pesto. </p>
<p> These pasta sauce recipes are weeknight lifesavers! Great not only on pasta, but on all sorts of vegetables and grain bowls as well. </p>
<p> Fresh pasta, you can do it! A beautiful, fun, and simple way to make homemade fettuccine noodles. </p>
<p> The perfect dinner. A hearty white bean soup topped with pillowy dollops of herb-packed pesto dumplings. Both vegan and vegetarian versions. </p>

<p> Pizza Dough Recipe ( Traditional Italian Pizza Dough Recipe ) </p>
<p> TRADITIONAL ITALIAN RECIPE: Every year, I flight to Italy to eat in some restaurants i select while I'm in the Toilet at home in Tokyo. </p>
<p> HEY... don't you judge me... reading helps me when i'm "s(h)itting". I never understood the physics behind that. And i'm not the only one. I have asked, to friends, and we are all built the same way. Someone has the newspaper there, other play with the iphone, while others read the ingredients of the Shampoo bottle. As far as my reseach conclused... you need to read something to take a shit. If you drop your book... it comes right up there... and that precious moment has gone forever. </p>
<p> So... i flight to Italy every now and then to check some new restaurants. </p>
<p> Last September i flew to Naples to try some real Neapolitan Pizza, and i've learnt so much. I even did a course. I'm not kidding! AHAHAHA... they have a super lame Pizza Course! :D </p>
<p> Can you imagine the kid "mom, can you make some pizza?" and the mother "sweety, mom has not take her Pizza Diploma yet, sorry, you'll have to eat some creckers tonight!" LOL </p>
<p> I was there. ( O.o ) </p>
<p> Don't judge me! I was curious! ( ^.^ ) </p>
<p> What I have learned is to use "00" flour – or else strong, finely milled white bread flour with a high gluten content – and it will give your dough an incredible super-smooth texture, fresh yeast (ask your baker or at your supermarket), and use ONLY Italian ingredients. </p>
<p> If using white bread flour instead, make sure it's a strong one that's high in gluten, as this will transform into a lovely, elastic dough, which is what you want. Mix in some semolina flour for a bit of colour and flavour if you like. </p>
<p> This is the Traditional Italian Pizza Dough Recipe, the one that make in Neaples. Fantastic, reliable, everyday neapolitan pizza dough, which can also be used to make bread. </p>
<p> The key to a really good result is, of course, the crust. I make pizza at my friend restaurant using the real Italian Oven, for fun, and at home at least twice a month, so you can be sure this recipe comes to you after years of very meticulous kitchen testing! </p>
<p> This crust has a nice bit of crunch, of course, having a Pizza Stone really helps, but it's pliable enough to fold in half if required. </p>
<p> Makes: 4 Pizze </p>
<p> 2.2lb Flour 21.1oz Warm Water ( Lukewarm ) 1oz Salt 0.5oz Yeast </p>
<p> Cups: </p>
<p> 7 cups Flour 2 cups Warm Water ( Lukewarm ) 2 tablespoons Salt 2 tablespoons Yeast </p>
<p> Directions: </p>
<p> 01 - Put the Hot Water in a pan. </p>
<p> 02 - Add Yeast and stir gently and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the yeast activates by turning into a foam on top of the water. </p>
<p> 03 - Now, add the Salt. </p>
<p> 04 - Gradually add in the Flour as you stir the mixture simultaneously. You know you have added enough Flour when the mixture becomes too thick to stir. </p>
<p> 05 - Knead the dough. </p>
<p> 06 - Take the Dough out of the bowl and put it on a clean and well-floured surface ( a marble counter or clean table is best ). </p>
<p> 07 - Gather the Dough into a pile and begin pressing it together. Press the heels of your hands firmly into the Dough, pushing forward slightly. </p>
<p> 08 - Fold the far edge of the Dough upwards, towards you, and press it into the middle of the ball. Rotate it slightly, too. Repeat this press-fold-turn sequence for the duration of the kneading process. </p>
<p> 09 - Let the Dough rise up for 1 hour at room temperature or 5 hours in the refrigerator. </p>
<p> 10 - Place on a floured counter and flour the top of the Dough. </p>
<p> 11 - Cut the Dough into two round Balls. </p>
<p> 12 - Flatten one Ball with your hand until about 2cm - 4cm / 0.7in - 1.5in thick. </p>
<p> 13 - Pick up the disk of Dough, and pinch the dough about 1.5cm / 0.5in from the edge. Try and stretch as you pinch, repeat this all around the edge. When the disk of Dough has been stretched enough to start to be floppy, proceed to tossing. </p>
<p> 14 - Make a fist and drape the Dough over your fist. Make a fist of the other hand and slip it under the Dough next to your other fist. Carefully move your fists apart stretching the Dough more. Shift your fists ( left towards your face, right away ) so the Dough rotates while stretching. </p>
<p> 15 - When the Dough has reached about 20cm / 8in in diameter, you can quickly move your left fist in an arc that goes backwards towards your face. Do this while twisting your right fist forward away from your face. If you give a a little push upwards with your right fist the Dough will spin like a Frisbee. Practice how it feels to balance the force of the fist twists equally. This will keep the Pizza from spinning off into the corner ( or worse ). </p>
<p> Be sure to catch the falling spinning Pizza as gently as you can with your two fists to avoid tearing. But if tearing just start over and do the spinning process over again. </p>
<p> - Take some Yeast off if you decide to leave it resting in the fridge for 14-18 hours. </p>
<p> - Don't knead the Dough too long. The texture changes fast. Every minutes counts. </p>

<p> Polish cuisine </p>
<p> Various kinds of Polish kielbasa. From the top down: Biała, Kabanos, Wiejska with mustard </p>
<p> Bagels originated in Poland and became widespread during migration of Polish Jews </p>
<p> Polish cuisine (Polish: Kuchnia polska) is a style of cooking and food preparation originating in or widely popular in Poland. Polish cuisine has evolved over the centuries to become very eclectic due to Poland's history and it shares many similarities with neighbouring German, Czech, Slovak and Silesian culinary traditions. It has also been widely influenced by other Central European cuisines, namely Austrian and Hungarian[1] as well as Jewish,[2] French, Italian, and Turkish.[3] Polish-styled cooking in other cultures is often referred to as à la polonaise. </p>
<p> Polish cuisine is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef, in addition to a wide range of vegetables, spices, and herbs.[4] It is also characteristic in its use of various kinds of noodles as well as cereals and grains.[5] In general, Polish cuisine is hearty and heavy in its use of butter, cream, eggs and extensive seasoning. The traditional dishes are often demanding in preparation. Many Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to serve and enjoy their festive meals, especially Christmas Eve supper (Wigilia) or Easter breakfast, which could take a number of days to prepare in their entirety. </p>
<p> A traditional Polish dinner is composed of three courses, beginning with a soup like the popular rosół broth and tomato soup. At restaurants, the soups are followed by an appetizer such as herring (prepared in either cream, oil, or in aspic); or other cured meats and vegetable salads. The main course usually includes a serving of meat, such as roast, breaded pork cutlet, or chicken, with a coleslaw-like surówka [suˈrufka], shredded root vegetables with lemon and sugar (carrot, celeriac, seared beetroot) or sauerkraut. The side dishes are usually boiled potatoes, rice or less commonly kasza. Meals often conclude with a dessert including makowiec, a poppy seed pastry, napoleonka cream pie or sernik cheesecake. </p>
<p> Internationally, if a Polish culinary tradition is used in other cuisines it is referred to as à la polonaise, from French meaning 'Polish-style'. In France the use of butter instead of cooking oil, frying vegetables with buttered breadcrumbs, minced parsley and boiled eggs (Polonaise garnish) as well as adding horseradish, lemon juice or sour cream to sauces like Velouté is known under this term.[8][9] </p>
<p> Polish cuisine in the Middle Ages was based on dishes made of agricultural produce and cereal crops (millet, rye, wheat), meats of wild and farm animals, fruits, forest berries and game, honey, herbs and local spices. It was known above all for abundant use of salt from Wieliczka and permanent presence of groats (kasza). A high calorific value of dishes and drinking beer or mead as a basic drink was typical of Middle Ages Polish cuisine. </p>
<p> During the Middle Ages the cuisine of Poland was heavy and spicy. Two main ingredients were meat (both game and beef) and cereal. The latter consisted initially of proso millet, but later in the Middle Ages other types of cereal became widely used. Most commoners did not use bread and instead consumed cereals in the forms of kasza or various types of flatbread, some of which (for instance kołacz) are considered traditional recipes even in the 21st century. Apart from cereals, a large portion of the daily diet of mediaeval Poles consisted of beans, mostly broad beans and peas. As the territory of Poland was densely forested, usage of mushrooms, forest berries, nuts and wild honey was also widespread. Among the delicacies of the Polish nobility were honey-braised bear paws served with horseradish-flavoured salad (now species protected in Poland), smoked bear tongue and bear bacon.[10][11] </p>
<p> Pierniki (Polish gingerbread) from Toruń, 14th century recipe </p>
<p> Thanks to close trade relations with Turkey and the countries in the Caucasus, the price of spices (such as black pepper and nutmeg) was much lower in Poland than the rest of Europe, hence spicy sauces became popular. The usage of two basic sauces (the jucha czerwona and jucha szara, or red and gray blood in Old Polish) remained widespread at least until the 18th century.[12] </p>
<p> The daily beverages included milk, whey, buttermilk and various herb infusions. The most popular alcoholic beverages were beer and mead; however in the 16th century upper classes began to import Hungarian and Silesian wines. Mead was so widespread that in the 13th century Prince Leszek I the White explained to the Pope that Polish knights could not participate in a crusade as there was no mead in the Holy Land.[13] Also, vodka became popular, possibly among the lower classes first. There is written evidence suggesting that vodka originated in Poland. The word "vodka" was recorded for the first time ever in 1405 in Akta Grodzkie,[14] the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland.[14] At that time, the word wódka (vodka) referred to chemical compounds such as medicines and cosmetic cleansers, while the popular beverage was called gorzałka [ɡɔˈʐawka] (from the Old Polish gorzeć). </p>
<p> Along with the Italian queen Bona Sforza (second wife of Sigismund I of Poland) many Italian cooks came to Poland after 1518. Although native vegetable foods were an ancient and intrinsic part of the cuisine, this began a period in which vegetables like lettuce, leeks, celeriac and cabbage were more widely used. Even today, some of those vegetables are referred to in Polish as włoszczyzna, a word derived from Włochy, the Polish name of Italy. During this period the use of spices, which arrived in Poland via Western Asian trade routes, was common among those who could afford them, and dishes considered elegant could be very spicy. However, the idea that Queen Bona was the first to introduce vegetables to Poland is false. While her southern cooks may have helped elevate and expand the role of various vegetables in royal Polish cuisine, records show that the court of king Jogaila (in Polish Władysław II Jagiełło, who died in 1434, over 80 years before her reign) enjoyed a variety of vegetables including lettuce, beets, cabbage, turnip, carrots, peas and cauliflower. </p>
<p> Polish-style pickled cucumber (ogórek kiszony) is a variety developed in the northern part of Central Europe. It has been exported worldwide and is found in the cuisines of many countries. It is usually preserved in wooden barrels. A cucumber only pickled for a few days is different in taste (less sour) than one pickled for a longer time and is called ogórek małosolny, which means "lightly salted cucumber". Another kind of pickled cucumber, popular in Poland, is ogórek konserwowy (preserved cucumber) which is preserved with vinegar rather than pickled and uses different spices creating a sweet and sour taste. </p>
<p> The only indisputable fact is that the court of Queen Bona was fed in an Italian fashion, because she exclusively employed Italian cooks, some of whom were originally hired to prepare parties for aristocratic families but who were soon serving typical Italian dishes as part of the court's daily menus. Court records show that Queen Bona imported large volumes of southern European, American and Western Asian fruits (oranges, lemons, pomegranates, olives, figs, tomatoes), vegetables (potatoes and corn), nuts (chestnuts, raisins and almonds, including marzipan), along with grains (such as rice), cane sugar and Italian olive oil. The court also imported various herbs and spices including black pepper, fennel, saffron, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon.[3] </p>
<p> Until the Partitions perpetrated by the neighbouring empires, Poland was one of the largest countries in the world, and encompassed many regions with their own, distinctive culinary traditions.[3] Two consecutive Polish kings, Władysław IV and John II Casimir (Polish: Jan II Kazimierz Waza) married the same French Duchess, Marie Louise Gonzaga (Polish: Ludwika Maria), daughter of Charles I, Duke of Mantua; persecuted by King Louis XIII of France for her affiance to his opponent Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Marie Louise arrived in Warsaw in 1646, was widowed, and married again in 1649. Ludwika brought along with her a court full of Frenchmen including courtiers, secretaries, army officers, physicians, merchants, craftsmen, as well as many cooks. </p>
<p> Bigos (hunter's stew), Polish national dish with various cuts of meat and sausages, cabbage, sauerkraut, often whole or puréed tomatoes, honey and mushrooms </p>
<p> Records show that her visiting guests were entertained with the following fowl: waxwings, fieldfares, snow bunting, hazel grouse, partridges, black grouse, capercaillies, forest game, fish and molluscs loach, trouts, grayling, salmon fresh and smoked, flounders, salted herring, lampreys in vinegar, oysters, snails, and Genoese pâté, not to mention fresh fruit and chestnuts. French and Italian wines were served, as well as mead and local beers. The dishes were made only according to French recipes. The royal court with all its innovations exerted a broad influence over the rest of aristocratic residences and noble palaces across Poland. French cuisine was in fashion and many families willingly employed French cooks and pâté makers. In the mid-18th century on Polish tables appeared the French champagne.[3] Also, among the most influential in that period were Lithuanian, Jewish, German and Hungarian cuisine, not to mention Armenian, which arrived in Poland before the 17th century along with many settlers especially in the south-eastern part of the Commonwealth.[3] Signature dishes of the Western Asia reached Polish tables thanks to the Armenian trade and cultural exchange with Poland's neighbour - the Ottoman Empire. Rare delicacies were brought to royal court as gifts from sultans and royal envoys. The strongest influences were noted in the cities of Lwów, Kraków, Kamieniec Podolski and Zamość due to many Armenians living there permanently.[3] Also, because of the close contact with the Ottoman Empire, coffee (kawa) and boza became popular. </p>
<p> With the subsequent decline of Poland, and the grain production crisis that followed The Deluge, potatoes began to replace the traditional use of cereal. The oldest surviving Polish cook-book, Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw ("Collection of Dishes") by Stanisław Czerniecki was published in Kraków in 1682.[15][16] Under the partitions, the cuisine of Poland became heavily influenced by cuisines of the surrounding empires. This included Russian and German cuisines, but also the culinary traditions of most nations of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The 19th century also saw the creation of many Polish cookbooks, by Jan Szyttler, Anna Ciundziewicka, Wincenta Zawadzka, Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa and others. </p>
<p> Most enduring of Polish culinary traditions are the pierogi, a national dish of Poland, originating in the ancient culinary traditions of the former Polish eastern territories (Kresy)[17] </p>
<p> After the end of World War II, Poland fell under Soviet / Communist occupation. Some restaurants were nationalized. The communists envisioned a net of lunch rooms called "bufet" for the workers at various companies, and milk bars for the public. The majority of restaurants that survived the 1940s and 1950s were state-owned. Workplace lunch rooms promoted mostly inexpensive meals, including soups of all kinds, meatballs and pork chops, and staples such as placki ziemniaczane (potato pancakes), placki z jablkami (apple pancakes), kopytka (potato gnocchi), leniwe (farmer's cheese gnocchi served sweet) and pierogi. A typical second course consisted of meat cutlet served with potatoes or buckwheat and "surówka" (raw, julienned vegetables). The popular Polish kotlet schabowy is a breaded cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener schnitzel and the Italian and Spanish Milanesa. </p>
<p> With time, the shortage economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like chocolate, sugar and meat were rationed, with a specific limit depending on social class and health requirements. Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, so much of the food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine.[18] Tropical fruits (citrus, banana, pineapple, etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices. </p>
<p> This situation led in turn to gradual replacement of traditional Polish cuisine with food prepared from anything available at the moment. Among the popular dishes introduced by the public restaurants was "kotlet mielony" meatball, a sort of a hamburger often served with beet puree and fresh carrots. The traditional recipes were mostly preserved during the Wigilia feast (Christmas Eve), for which many families tried to prepare 12 traditional courses. </p>
<p> A popular form of fish dish was, and still is, paprykarz szczeciński from the city of Szczecin, usually added to sandwiches. </p>
<p> Zapiekanka, a baguette with melted cheese, meat, mushrooms, onions and ketchup. A popular street food to this day which originated in the 1970s </p>
<p> With the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, a wave of new restaurants opened and the basic foodstuffs were once again easily obtainable. This led to a gradual return of rich traditional Polish cuisine, both in home cooking and in restaurants. At the same time, restaurants and supermarkets promoted the use of ingredients typical of other cuisines of the world. Among the most notable foods that started to become common in Poland were cucurbits, zucchini and all kinds of fish. During communist times, these were available fresh mostly in the seaside regions. </p>
<p> Recent years have seen the advent of a slow food movement, and a number of TV programmes devoted to other cuisine and as well as traditional Polish cuisine have gained popularity. In 2011 a nostalgic cookbook (written in English) combining a child's memories growing up in the Gierek era with traditional Polish recipes was published in London.[19][20] </p>
<p> American food in Poland, most commonly McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut, are declining in popularity as Polish people prefer their own cuisine.[citation needed] Meanwhile, Doner kebabs are gaining popularity. Nonetheless, in most of Poland one can still get traditional and very popular Polish fast-food such as zapiekanka (baguette with cheese, mushrooms, onion or peppers, sometimes meat and ketchup), kebab, hamburgers, hot dogs and sausage. There are also many small-scale, quick-service restaurants which usually serve items such as zapiekanka. </p>
<p> Traditional Christmas Eve supper called Wigilia is meatless, usually consists of barszcz (borscht) with uszka (small dumplings) – a classic Polish Christmas Eve starter, followed by fried carp, carp fillet or cod with apple & leeks fresh salad, carp in aspic etc. traditionally carp (fried or Jewish style) provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland. Other popular dishes, for the next day, include pickled matjas herring, rollmops, pierogi with sauerkraut and forest mushrooms, fish soup, kiełbasa, hams and bigos (savory stew of cabbage and meat) and vegetable salads. Among popular desserts are gingerbread, cheesecake, various fruits like oranges among others, poppy seed cake makowiec (makówki in Silesia), fruit kompot, kluski with poppyseed and gingerbread. Regional dishes include żurek, siemieniotka (in Silesia) and kołduny, stuffed dumplings with mushrooms or meat from the eastern regions. </p>
<p> Tłusty Czwartek or "Fat Thursday", is a Polish culinary custom on the last Thursday before Lent, it is equivalent to Pancake Day. Traditionally it is an occasion to enjoy sweets and cakes before the forty days of abstinence expected of Catholics until Easter Day. The most popular sweetmeats on Fat Thursday are pączki, Polish doughnuts, "faworki", sometimes called, "chrust", equivalent to the French beignet. Traditional Polish doughnuts are filled with rose petal jam, plum jam or apple and covered with icing with orange peel or powdered with icing sugar. Fat Thursday used to mark the beginning of a "Fat Week", a period of great gluttony during which Polish ancestors consumed dishes served with smalec (lard), bacon and all kinds of meat. </p>
<p> The original doughnuts, popular until the 16th century, were made of the same dough as bread, would be filled with pork and fried on smalec. Only later were they made as patisserie. </p>
<p> Zupa pomidorowa (tomato soup) with rice or noodles is a popular dish as part of a Polish dinner </p>

<p> Bread (chleb) and bread rolls (bułka, kajzerka) makes the Polish cuisine and tradition complete. It has been an essential part of them both for centuries. Today bread remains one of the most important foods in the Polish cuisine. The main ingredient for Polish bread is rye or wheat. Traditional bread has a crunchy crust, is soft but not too soft inside, and has unforgettable aroma. Such bread is made with sourdough, which lends it a distinctive taste. It can be stored for a week or so without getting too hard and is not crumbly when cut. </p>
<p> In Poland, welcoming with bread and salt ("chlebem i solą") is often associated with the traditional hospitality ("staropolska gościnność") of the Polish nobility (szlachta), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century Polish poet, Wespazjan Kochowski, wrote in 1674: "O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!" Another poet who mentioned the custom was Wacław Potocki.[2] The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish proverbs.[22] Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church wedding. </p>

<p> Tyskie beer. Poland is Europe's third largest beer producer, producing 36.9 million hectolitres </p>
<p> Mead Półtorak, made from natural honey and grape fruit, 16% alc. 750 ml (26 imp fl oz; 25 US fl oz) </p>
<p> Traditional Polish alcoholic beverages include mead, beer, vodka (old Polish names: okowita, gorzała) and to a lesser extent wine. In recent decades beer has become very common, while wine is less frequently drunk, though in recent years the trend for its consumption is rising along with increasing production of local grape wines in small vineyards in Lesser Poland, Subcarpathia, Silesia and West Pomerania regions. Among the alcoholic beverages, Polish vodka is traditionally prepared from grain or potatoes – it essentially displaced the formerly widespread mead.[23] </p>
<p> Some sources suggest that the first production of vodka took place in Poland as early as the 8th century, becoming more widespread in the 11th century.[24] The world's first written mention of the drink and of the word "vodka" was in 1405 from Akta Grodzkie recorder of deeds,[14] the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland.[14] </p>
<p> Vodka production on a much larger scale began in Poland at the end of the 16th century. By the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish vodka was known in the Netherlands, Denmark, England, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and the Black Sea basin.[25] Vodka was the most popular alcoholic drink in Poland until 1998, when it was surpassed by beer.[23] </p>
<p> Non-alcoholic </p>
<p> In contemporary times, tea is perhaps the most popular, drunk sometimes with a slice of lemon and sweetened with sugar. Tea came into Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However its prevalence is attributed to the Russians in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in Polish homes. Tea is usually served with a slice of lemon and sweetened with either sugar or honey. Tea with milk is called a bawarka ("Bavarian style").[26] Coffee is also widely drunk since the 18th century, as Poland bordered the Ottoman Empire at the time. Kvass is also consumed in parts of Poland, especially in the east. Even though not as popular, it is increasingly being sold in bars and restaurants. It is typically made from rye bread, usually known as black bread, and is not classified as an alcoholic beverage in Poland, as its alcohol content usually ranges from 0.5-1% or 1-2 proof. There are many variations of the drink, however, a traditional Polish recipe exists.[27][28][29] Frequently consumed beverages also include: buttermilk, kefir, soured milk, instant coffee, various mineral waters, juices and numerous brands of soft drink. </p>

<p> Nana’s Pork and Sauerkraut (Instant Pot, Crock Pot, & Oven) </p>
<p> It may be a German New Years tradition, but this easy, comforting Pork and Sauerkraut recipe should be enjoyed all winter long! This hearty, naturally low carb dish is full of savory flavors thanks to the kraut-infused pork and kielbasa, and can be made easily in the Instant Pot, oven, or slow cooker. </p>
<p> Growing up in a Polish-German household, I was introduced to some really interesting flavors. </p>
<p> Buttermilk (better than you’d imagine). </p>
<p> Braunschweiger (aka liverwurst. OMGsogood). </p>
<p> Cabbage of all kinds, including sauerkraut. </p>
<p> Sauerkraut is definitely an acquired taste for most people – so sour and pungent. But if I can get my hubby to love it, I might just be able to work on you, too. </p>
<p> JUST TAKE ME TO THE PORK AND SAUERKRAUT ALREADY! </p>
<p> If you’d rather skip my (pretty darn helpful) tips and tricks, essential cooking info, and similar recipe ideas – and get straight to this deliciously easy pork and sauerkraut recipe, just scroll right on down to the bottom of the page where you can find the printable recipe card! </p>
<p> Over the years, I’ve made this pork and kraut every which way. Nana’s only method was in the oven, and I love how the top shreds of cabbage get a little crispy. </p>
<p> I often toss everything in my Crock Pot and go about my business, enjoying the smells of the sauerkraut and pork mingling as it cooks all day. </p>
<p> Trying it in my Instant Pot was a real game changer, though. </p>
<p> Imagine a dinner that takes hours of cook time to develop the best flavors taking about 30 minutes instead. </p>
<p> Don’t you just love it when comfort foods are almost instantaneous? </p>
<p> This recipe is slightly adapted from the one that appears in my cookbook, and is closer to the traditional way my Nana prepared hers. </p>
<p> She wasn’t one for adding apples or brown sugar, and is the reason I think I really love kraut. She never hid it under anything sweet. </p>
<p> Besides…this version of the recipe fits perfectly into that Keto diet I’ve been trying to stay on. </p>
<p> Why Do You Eat Pork and Sauerkraut on New Years? </p>
<p> Eating pork and sauerkraut on New Year’s Eve is a tradition in Germany. It is believed that the meal will bring blessings and wealth for the new year. </p>
<p> Pigs are a symbol for good luck and well-being in many parts of the world. </p>
<p> Before the meal, diners wish each other as much luck and money as there are shreds of cabbage in the pot of kraut. </p>
<p> While you might not get a winning lottery ticket from eating this meal, you will definitely find both your belly and your heart full, which are blessings in themselves. </p>
<p> What Cut Of Pork is Best For Pork and Sauerkraut? </p>
<p> If your plan is to cook this pork and sauerkraut in the oven or slow cooker, I recommend a pork roast over anything. </p>
<p> A bone-in or boneless butt or shoulder should have enough fat to keep it from drying out while it slow cooks, and will absorb great flavors in the meantime. </p>
<p> For Instant Pot cooking, country style ribs or pork loin (NOT tenderloin) are also an option thanks to the shorter cooking time. </p>
<p> How To Cook Low Carb Pork and Sauerkraut In The Instant Pot </p>
<p> Preheat the pressure cooker on Sauté mode. Add butter to pot and melt. Cut pork into 1-inch chunks and season pork chunks with salt and pepper to taste. Place in a single layer in the pot and sear for 3 minutes, stirring to brown all over. Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining pork. </p>
<p> Return all pork to the pot. Stir in some of the sauerkraut juice and deglaze the pot, scraping the browned bits from the bottom. Add the onion and stir, then cook for 2-3 minutes until liquid is reduced by half. </p>
<p> Press the Cancel button. Pour sauerkraut on top of pork and onions. Secure the lid and cook on Manual High for 10 minutes. At the end of the cook time, allow a 10 minute Natural Release, then open the valve to release any remaining steam. </p>
<p> Remove the lid from the pressure cooker and add the kielbasa and caraway seeds (if using), stirring to toss the contents of the pot. Close the lid and allow the kielbasa to warm for 5-10 minutes before serving. </p>
<p> How To Cook Pork and Sauerkraut In The Oven </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Pat pork dry, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Cut the kielbasa into two pieces and set aside. </p>
<p> Melt butter in a heavy bottomed skillet set over high heat. When butter is sizzling, carefully place pork in the skillet and sear on each side for 5-6 minutes until golden brown. Remove to a plate to rest. </p>
<p> Layer half of the sauerkraut and sliced onions in the bottom of a casserole dish or Dutch oven. Sprinkle with caraway seeds if desired. Place the seared pork roast and kielbasa pieces on top, then layer on remaining sauerkraut, onions, and caraway seeds. (Make sure there is at least a cup of liquid in the dish before baking.) </p>
<p> Cover tightly and bake for 2 hours, or until a meat thermometer reads 150F. Remove from oven and allow pork to rest for at least 15 minutes before carving and serving. </p>
<p> How To Cook Pork and Sauerkraut In The Slow Cooker </p>
<p> Melt butter in a heavy bottomed skillet set over high heat. When butter is sizzling, carefully place pork in the skillet and sear on each side for 5-6 minutes until golden brown. Remove to a plate to rest. Cut kielbasa into two pieces and set aside. </p>
<p> Layer half of the sauerkraut and sliced onions in a 6-quart slow cooker, then set the pork on top. Sprinkle with caraway seeds if desired. Place the seared pork roast and kielbasa pieces on top, then layer on remaining sauerkraut, onions, and caraway seeds. </p>
<p> Cook on high for 2-3 hours, or low for 6-8 hours, or until pork is tender but stays together. Transfer to a serving platter and enjoy. </p>

<p> Pork chop recipes </p>
<p> Pork chop info </p>
<p> Pork chops come from the loin and are sliced perpendicular to the pig's spine. They can be sold both on and off the bone, but should always have a generous rind of fat to add richness and flavour to what is otherwise quite a lean piece of meat. They are best cooked quickly and over a high heat, making them a fantastic cut for the barbecue. </p>
<p> This collection of pork chop recipes demonstrates the versatility and year long appeal of this tasty cut, with warming winter comforts and summer barbecue dishes alike. Matthew Tomkinson's Apple and pork chop recipe pairs the sweetness of pork with the sharp tang of apple, and Marcus Wareing similarly applies this classic combination in his Barbecued pork chop recipe with apple purée, endive and barbecue sauce. For a vibrant, colourful option for the summer try Robert Ortiz's Pork chop with prunes, red cabbage and Greek yoghurt, where the chops are first marinated for several hours in Peruvian achiote oil. </p>

<p> Cocoa-and-Chile-Rubbed Pork Chops </p>
<p> Chef Tim Love rubs meat with a bit of sugar to help brown it but finishes the dish over low heat so the sugar doesn't char the outside. Here, he coats pork chops with cocoa and chile powders for a rub that's like a deconstructed version of Mexican mole sauce. </p>

<p> Pork Chops with Apple, Fennel and Sage </p>
<p> Boneless, thin-cut pork chops can be fully cooked in three minutes, a fraction of the time it takes to cook thicker chops. Here, F&W’s Melissa Rubel Jacobson combines the meat with a few distinctly autumnal ingredients: sage, apple and hard cider. </p>

<p> Juniper-Brined Double-Cut Pork Chops </p>
<p> Before cooking the locally raised Berkshire pork they sell at Fleisher's, Jessica and Joshua Applestone like to brine it for a few hours in a mixture of juniper berries, orange zest and peppercorns to help season the meat and keep it juicy. Then Jessica Applestone recommends cooking it simply with a sprig of rosemary. "Salt, pepper and flame is all you need. Why lose the beauty of the meat by adding more?" she says. </p>

<p> Sage-Rubbed Pork Chops with Pickled Peach Relish </p>
<p> For the sweet-savory peach relish that accompanies these big, juicy pork chops, Amelia O’Reilly says it’s important to use firm, ripe fruit that won’t get mushy during pickling. </p>

<p> Two-Day Spice-Rubbed Pork Chops </p>
<p> Sam Hayward prefers cooking with pork from small farmers who raise heritage breeds, such as Berkshire, Gloucestershire Old Spot or Duroc. This pork is deeply colored and often as marbled as high-quality beef, and Hayward treats it with the special care it deserves. His two-day curing process is worth the time because it allows the spices to penetrate these thick and juicy chops. </p>

<p> Seaweed-Dusted Pork Chops with Quick-Pickled Carrots </p>
<p> Chef Daniel Patterson uses ground dried seaweed as a rub to coat thick pork chops before pan-roasting them. This is a simplified version of the dish Patterson created, in which he cooked seaweed with garam masala and soy sauce then dehydrated and ground it. </p>

<p> Grilled Pork Chops with Anchovies and Swiss Chard </p>
<p> Most tasters couldn't detect anchovies in the marinade for the pork and were pleasantly surprised to learn that they actually liked the hint of pungent saltiness. One secret is to let the chops marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes, which yields juicier meat after grilling. </p>

<p> When Matt Molina arrived in Italy, he had succulent pork chops wrapped in thin layers of lardo (cured pork fat). If lardo is hard to find, substitute pancetta (cured pork belly rolled into a log); unfurl the slices into long strips before wrapping the chops. </p>

<p> Potato-Crusted Pork Schnitzel with Hot Pepper Mayonnaise </p>
<p> It’s not a trick of molecular gastronomy that produces the shatteringly crisp crust on these butter-fried pork chops. The secret? Dried potato flakes, aka instant mashed potatoes. The flakes are made from dehydrated cooked potatoes and make a great gluten-free substitute for breadcrumbs. Be sure to look for hot cherry peppers, not sweet ones, to give the mayo-based sauce some kick. </p>

<p> 1) Heat the oil in a heavy large skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle the pork chops with salt and pepper. Add the pork cutlets to the skillet and cook until they are brown and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted horizontally into the pork registers 70°C, about three minutes per side. Transfer the pork chops to a plate and tent with foil to keep them warm. </p>
<p> 2) Add the onion to the same skillet and saute over medium heat until crisp-tender, about four minutes. Add the tomatoes with their juices, herbes de Provence, and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Cover and simmer until the flavors blend and the juices thicken slightly, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. Season the sauce, to taste, with salt and more red pepper flakes. Return the pork cutlets and any accumulated juices from the plate to the skillet and turn the pork chops to coat with the sauce. </p>
<p> 3) Place one pork cutlet on each plate. Spoon the sauce over the pork chops. Sprinkle with the parsley and serve. </p>

<p> Really great recipe Peter! My parents are German so I grew up on this stuff but didn't like it when I was a kid. I didn't have any apple juice so I just added a bit of brown sugar. To make this a more complete meal I removed the chops after browning and fryed up some bacon pieces. I then added my onions and garlic and then the kraut and caraway seeds along with a good bottle of beer and some chicken broth. While that was simmering I placed my chops in a casserole dish and topped them with thinly sliced potatoes. The kraut then went on top of the potatoes I covered with foil and placed it in the oven for about and hour and a half. The "broth" in this dish was so flavorful and the meat was extremely tender. Hubby was thrilled. Thanks so much!!!! Read More </p>

<p> I have been making a recipe that is very close to this for years. However instead of apple juice I use 3/4 CUP OF APPLE SAUCE and a few tablespoons of BROWN SUGAR! It really gives it nice flavor and my pork chops have always come out moist. Enjoy! Read More </p>
<p> I too have been making a version of this for years - from mom's recipe. She always included a peeled cored and diced red delicious apple. It's purpose is to reduce the acidity of the sauerkraut - it's supposed to turn to mush and be not noticeable when done. Her version uses pork ribs which I've started browning first to make the color of the finished dish a lovely brown. I've also started using the caraway seeds for a subtle flavor improvement. I use the fresher 'bagged' sauerkraut found in the refrigerated food section instead of the variety in the jar and include the juice with the sauerkraut. The apple really works! We serve it over mashed potatoes. It's one of our favorite comfort foods! Read More </p>
<p> It's very good! I didn't drain the liquid from the sauerkraut plus I added more apple juice (1/4C). In a skillet I browned the pork chops on both sides and sauted the kraut too and then for a really tender juicy meat I baked mine at 350' (covered) for an hour. I have also tried this recipe with 1/4 cup of beer(instead of apple juice) and a 1/2 small apple peeled cored and sliced it's really good this way as well. THX. Read More </p>
<p> Grandma made pork and sauerkraut every New Year. She'd have loved this recipe. When I served it New Year's Day my husband said "You sure don't have to wait a year to make this again." It was great. Note: If you use kraut with little or no juice -- you may want to add a little water or increase the apple juice. Read More </p>
<p> The chops were very tender and tasty however I would suggest using applesauce instead of the sliced apples they went to mush. Use quartered apples adding them later in the cooking process. This recipe benefits from the apple flavour and the appearance of the apples. Read More </p>
<p> Delicious! I wasn't going to add the caraway seed but I'm glad I did because that really makes the dish. After sauteeing everything I covered and cooked in the oven. Put sliced potatoes on the bottom pork chops in the middle and then sauerkraut on top.I added a bit of chicken broth to the mix as well. Absolutely awesome recipe PETEITC. Thank you! Read More </p>
<p> Very good. Not too difficult. Changed the order of cooking. Cooked bacon in pan first. Remove to paper towel. Brown chops in bacon fat. Place in a 9x13. Saute onion and garlic a few minutes until soft. Add applesauce brown sugar and sauerkraut to pan bring to boil. Scrape up all the brown bits. Crumble bacon on top of chops and pour rest of ingredients on top cover with foil and bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. Read More </p>
<p> This was my first time trying sauerkraut and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I actually used applesauce instead of juice and I put it all in my slow-cooker for about 5 hours on high. It came out deliciously tender and moist and my husband and I both want to have it again! Read More </p>

<p> Add the oil to the cooker and brown the pork chops on both sides. Remove the browned chops and set aside. Add the shallots and garlic to the cooker and sauté until the shallots start to brown and soften – about 3 minutes. Add the white wine and stir, scraping up any brown bits on bottom of cooker. Simmer for one minute. Add the artichoke hearts, capers, sundried tomatoes, chicken stock, Italian seasoning and lemon slices. Stir to combine, making sure the lemon slices are submerged in the liquid. Return the pork chops to the cooker and lock the lid in place. </p>
<p> Pressure cook on HIGH for 4 minutes. </p>
<p> While the pork chops are cooking mix the butter and flour together in a small bowl to form a paste. 6.Let the pressure drop NATURALLY and carefully remove the lid. Remove pork chops and let them rest for 5 to 10 minutes, loosely covered with foil. Return the cooker to the BROWN setting. Whisk the butter and flour paste into the sauce and bring the liquid to a boil to thicken. Stir in the fresh parsley and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve the pork chops with some rice, or over angel hair pasta and top with the sauce and vegetables. </p>

<p> Can you use chicken breasts in this recipe? If so, how long would I cook them in the pressure cooker? Thanks! </p>
<p> Sure you could use chicken breasts instead. If you are using boneless breasts, it will depend a little on how large they are, but I would suggest 3 minutes with a natural pressure release (for at least 10 minutes). </p>

<p> Directions </p>
<p> Instructions Checklist </p>
<p> Step 1 </p>
<p> Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in mushrooms; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl and set aside. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Step 2 </p>
<p> Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the pork chops, browning on both sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Place the pork chops on a plate, then drain all but 1 tablespoon of drippings from the skillet. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Step 3 </p>
<p> Pour in the tomatoes, then season with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Transfer the pork chops back to the skillet; cover and simmer until the pork chops are tender and no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. Stir in some water if the mixture becomes too dry. Place the bell pepper on top of the pork, then add the reserved mushrooms. Continue to simmer until the bell pepper is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. </p>

<p> Followed the recipe as written. These were good, but not great. I would highly suggest seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper as you're browning them, because although the sauce is flavorful enough, the chops themselves were on the bland side. Also, my chops turned out dry and I don't know if this was due to the long simmering time or what. On the plus side, this recipe is easy and presents nicely. Read More </p>

<p> These pork chops were tender and juicy and had a lot of flavor. We loved them! I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms (didn't have any) and I left out the salt (personal preference). This is a terrific quick and easy weeknight dinner that everyone will love. Read More </p>
<p> Delicious! I scaled this to 2 servings, but made half of the sauce. I used a mix a colored peppers and sautéed them separately, topping the chops with them when plating. The flavor of this is excellent, perfectly seasoned. The only thing I would change next time is to cut back on the simmering time because my chops dried out a bit, even though I used a very low simmer. But that is an easy fix and I will definitely be making this again! Read More </p>
<p> I've made this a quite few times so now I know what changes need to be made. I make 2 chops but use a whole can of tomatoes. There just isn't enough sauce and adding water dilutes it so use more tomatoes, about double the amount. The cook time is way too much. I seared 2 mins on each side. They should be brown but not fully cooked. Simmered for 15 mins, not 45 and another 5 after adding the mushrooms and bell pepper. Added more mushrooms to make it a whole meal so I didn't have to make a side of veggies. Granted, if you use really thick chops, you may want to simmer them longer but I would't suggest 45 mins. I also throw in some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Not necessary because the sauce is delicious but I wanted some spice. Read More </p>
<p> I absolutely loved these pork chops! The only thing I did was added a little bit more seasoning since my family likes their food spicy but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was a sure hit! It's been added to my recipe box for future use. The chops are juicy and tender...try it! Read More </p>
<p> I put this in my Recipe Box because of it seemed to be a very healthy recipe...according to the nutritional information...although I wonder if it was calculated correctly?? Anyway..it was quite simple to make and it was VERY tasty! I used a 540 ml can of Alymers Cracked Black Peppercord and Roasted Garlic stewed tomatoes and the flavour was AMAZING! I used a red pepper but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. The sauce was so good it might be good as a pasta sauce on it's own and I will defiantly try this with chicken. I did try this with chicken..not as good..something about the pork chops I guess! Read More </p>
<p> Very good easy to make and presents nicely. I did use bone in chops so they didn't dry out and added red wine in place of the water for a tad more flavor. Wine for the sauce and wine for the cook. Doesn't get much better than that! Served over polenta and with a simple side salad. Thank you lutzflcat for the recipe. Will go into my favorites file!

<p> These pork chops are very good. I use diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the regular tomatoes and added black greek olives. Read More </p>

<p> The secret to moist pork chops is to use bone in chops. The boneless chops dry out during the simmering process. </p>
<p> Followed the recipe as written. These were good, but not great. I would highly suggest seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper as you're browning them, because although the sauce is flavorful enough, the chops themselves were on the bland side. Also, my chops turned out dry and I don't know if this was due to the long simmering time or what. On the plus side, this recipe is easy and presents nicely. </p>

<p> These pork chops were tender and juicy and had a lot of flavor. We loved them! I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms (didn't have any) and I left out the salt (personal preference). This is a terrific quick and easy weeknight dinner that everyone will love. </p>
<p> Delicious! I scaled this to 2 servings, but made half of the sauce. I used a mix a colored peppers and sautéed them separately, topping the chops with them when plating. The flavor of this is excellent, perfectly seasoned. The only thing I would change next time is to cut back on the simmering time because my chops dried out a bit, even though I used a very low simmer. But that is an easy fix and I will definitely be making this again! </p>
<p> I've made this a quite few times so now I know what changes need to be made. I make 2 chops but use a whole can of tomatoes. There just isn't enough sauce and adding water dilutes it so use more tomatoes, about double the amount. The cook time is way too much. I seared 2 mins on each side. They should be brown but not fully cooked. Simmered for 15 mins, not 45 and another 5 after adding the mushrooms and bell pepper. Added more mushrooms to make it a whole meal so I didn't have to make a side of veggies. Granted, if you use really thick chops, you may want to simmer them longer but I would't suggest 45 mins. I also throw in some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Not necessary because the sauce is delicious but I wanted some spice. </p>
<p> I absolutely loved these pork chops! The only thing I did was added a little bit more seasoning since my family likes their food spicy but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was a sure hit! It's been added to my recipe box for future use. The chops are juicy and tender...try it! </p>
<p> I put this in my Recipe Box because of it seemed to be a very healthy recipe...according to the nutritional information...although I wonder if it was calculated correctly?? Anyway..it was quite simple to make and it was VERY tasty! I used a 540 ml can of Alymers Cracked Black Peppercord and Roasted Garlic stewed tomatoes and the flavour was AMAZING! I used a red pepper but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. The sauce was so good it might be good as a pasta sauce on it's own and I will defiantly try this with chicken. I did try this with chicken..not as good..something about the pork chops I guess! </p>
<p> Very good easy to make and presents nicely. I did use bone in chops so they didn't dry out and added red wine in place of the water for a tad more flavor. Wine for the sauce and wine for the cook. Doesn't get much better than that! Served over polenta and with a simple side salad. Thank you lutzflcat for the recipe. Will go into my favorites file! </p>
<p> These pork chops are very good. I use diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the regular tomatoes and added black greek olives. </p>

<p> Pork Chops with Apples and Cider </p>
<p> Pork Chops with apples and cider in a delicious creamy sauce are juicy, tender and creamy. They are bursting with creamy apple cider flavor. The entire pork chop recipe takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish! As much as you love these easy pork chops the day of, they make exceptional leftovers as well! I’ve included detailed instructions, tips, tricks and everything you need to know to make the BEST Pork Chop recipe. When cooked right, a pork chop can be a juicy and flavorful main course, either as a quick and easy weeknight supper or a nice holiday dinner. In this fall recipe, the pork chops are moist, juicy and flavored with Italian seasoning. They go so well with cooked apples and the most delicious creamy apple cider sauce. With all the apples out there this time of the year, it’s really easy to make something so tasty. And apple cider does provide some major savory flavoring power! Definitely company pleasing and holiday worthy but family friendly and everyday easy! This delicious pork chop recipe makes for a perfect cold weather meal in the fall! </p>
<p> This is how you make this pork chop recipe </p>
<p> First things first, season the pork chops with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning on both sides and let them rest for about 30 minutes. Why? To allow them to warm up a bit which would prevent them from drying out when cooking. The salt will add extra moisture as well. No-one likes dry chops. </p>
<p> While the pork chops are absorbing the seasoning and salt, let’s prepare the apples. You will need two apples. Slice each apple into 12 wedges. Now melt butter in the preheated pan and add the apple wedges to the pan in one layer. Brown gently on each side for 2 minutes per side. </p>
<p> Remove cooked apples from the pan and add olive oil and more butter. </p>
<p> Next place pork chops in the pan and brown them on each side for about 4 minutes per side. </p>
<p> Once cooked, remove pork chops and keep them in the warm oven on a platter while making the sauce. </p>
<p> What’s in the pork chop sauce? </p>
<p> To make the amazing sauce for pork chops, you will start by sautéing onion and garlic. Also, add thyme leaves at this point. Then deglaze with wine and add flour to create paste that will thicken the sauce down the road. Don’t add more than 2 tablespoons of flour. </p>
<p> Next add apple cider and cook it down a bit on medium heat. </p>
<p> Once the cider has reduced, add chicken stock and heavy cream to the pan and bring to a simmering point. </p>
<p> Season with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Now return chops and apples to the pan, reheat slightly and serve! </p>
<p> Pork Chops in Apple Cider Sauce </p>
<p> These simple pork chops are flavored with sliced apples, apple cider, creamy sauce, and a splash of wine! </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Season pork chops with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning on both sides. Cover and leave chops at room temperature to absorb seasonings for at least 30 minutes. This would also allow them too retain moisture when cooking. </p>
<p> While the pork chops are absorbing the seasoning, cook the apples. Slice each apple into 12 wedges. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a wide skillet and raise heat to medium-high. Add apple wedges in one layer and brown gently on one side, about 2 minutes. Brown on the other side and cook for 2 minutes more, or until apples are cooked through but still firm. Remove apples from pan and keep warm. </p>
<p> Heat the oil and 1 tablespoon butter to pan and swirl to melt. Place pork chops in pan and brown for about 4 minutes per side. Adjust heat if necessary to keep pork from cooking too quickly. Remove chops and keep warm on a platter in a low oven. </p>
<p> Turn the heat to low, add butter, then add the chopped onion, saute until tender for about 5-7 minutes, then add the minced garlic and thyme leaves and cook for a minute longer. Then deglaze the pan with wine. Add the flour and stir to incorporate the flour into the fat and liquid to create a paste. </p>
<p> Add apple cider to pan, raise heat to high and cook down a bit. Add chicken stock and heavy cream, and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </p>
<p> Return the pork chops to the pan and add the fried apples. Reheat on low heat. </p>

<p> Did only one 1½ center cut boneless chop. Made the full recipe of sauce. Was to sweet for our taste. Even though it is dry, the cider still has a bit fs a sweet taste. Like the basic taste so will experiment with the liquid and the sugar amount. Maybe some larger and Calvados plus ½ the brown sugar. </p>
<p> Mmm, it looks amazing! I can smell this perfect fragrance even through the screen. Actually, I’m not a big fan of pork, and my family and friends love chicken or turkey more, but sometimes I choose to prepare pork chops with different seasonings and with delicious sauce. By the way, I added apples and cider to chicken breasts few times, and I liked the result, but the idea to do something similar with pork has never come to my mind. This is a very good recipe, thank you very much! </p>
<p> That’s so great to hear about the chicken version of the similar dish! I have some apple cider sitting in the fridge and should probably try it like that. </p>

<p> Gordon Ramsay's delicious and simple recipe will take your pork chops to a whole new level ... </p>
<p> Method </p>
<p> 1. </p>
<p> To make the peppers, heat a little olive oil in large frying pan and add the onion and peppers. Season with salt and pepper, add the sugar and sauté over a high heat for 4–5 minutes until soft and coloured. (Make sure you can hear the vegetables hissing in the pan. If not, the pan isn’t hot enough and you’re in danger of boiling the vegetables instead of frying them.) </p>
<p> 2. </p>
<p> Add the vinegar and let it bubble for a minute or two until it has reduced and the peppers are soft. </p>
<p> 3. </p>
<p> Turn down the heat, add the tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and cook for a further 2–3 minutes. </p>
<p> 4. </p>
<p> Stir in the shredded basil and continue to cook for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to infuse. Wipe the pan clean, ready to cook the pork. </p>
<p> 5. </p>
<p> Using a sharp knife, make cuts into the fat of the chops, about 5mm deep and at 3–4cm intervals, making sure you don’t cut into the meat. (This will stop the meat from curling up during cooking and will make it cook more evenly.) </p>
<p> 6. </p>
<p> Season the chops really well on both sides, pushing the seasoning into the meat. </p>
<p> 7. </p>
<p> Place the cleaned-out frying pan over a high heat until hot and add a dash of oil. Add the chops, garlic and thyme and fry for 2–3 minutes until coloured. Turn and fry for a further 2–3 minutes on the other side, pushing the thyme under the chops and breaking up the garlic a little. </p>
<p> 8. </p>
<p> Towards the end of cooking time, add 3 knobs of butter and baste the chops with it as they are cooking, to speed up the cooking process and keep the chops moist. (Push the fatty edge of the chops towards the back of the pan to help render the fat.) </p>
<p> 9. </p>
<p> Squeeze the garlic out of its skin and place with the herbs on top of the chops. </p>
<p> 10. </p>
<p> Transfer the chops to a plate, and rest for 5–10 minutes, spooning over the basting butter now and again. </p>
<p> 11. </p>
<p> Serve the chops on top of the peppers with the resting juices and a little juice from the peppers. </p>

<p> Just made this tonight in the States. It was incredible. Peppers turned out beautiful and chops were cooked to perfection. I followed him on a YouTube video step by step. Easy and quick and tastes sublime. </p>
<p> Absolutely delicious, very simple to cook and the most tender pork chop I've had the pleasure of cooking. </p>

<p> Pork info </p>
<p> Pork is one of the most widely used meats in Italian cooking, although Italian consumers remain far more likely to buy cured meats (such as salami and prosciutto) than fresh. Preparations of cooked pork vary from region to region, with it popular in Calabria to grill chops flavoured with pepper and fennel (braciole di maiale) or roasted and stuffed with salt, herbs and garlic to make porchetta in central Italy. This collection of pork recipes contains a variety of different cuts and preparations, from ham and pancetta to pork ribs and suckling pig recipes. </p>
<p> Roberto Petza uses suckling pig in his pork terrine recipe, serving the neat cubes of meat with tangy orange compote and edible flowers in a beautifully presented starter dish. Emanuele Scarello uses pork mince in his ragù recipe, while Giorgio and Gian Pietro Damini serve succulent sous vide pork ribs with marinated asparagus and a stunning mustard crumb. </p>

<p> 26 Cooking Tricks to Steal from the World’s Best Chefs </p>
<p> If you’ve ever taken a cooking class, there was probably a moment (or several) when the instructor demo’d something—how to properly sear meat, or how to efficiently cut veggies—and said something like, “As I’m sure you know, you should always…” </p>
<p> This happened to me when I took my first-ever class at The Brooklyn Kitchen with culinary instructor Sydney Willcox. Willcox kept saying things as she effortlessly floated around the kitchen, and I kept wanting to whip out my phone and take notes, because as basic as what she was saying sounded, they were epiphanies to me, revelations that would cut down my prep time before dinner and minimize the chances of me slicing a finger open. </p>
<p> Below, check out 26 general cooking tips from nine pro chefs around the U.S., some of whom specialize in gourmet vegan cooking, some of whom are grilling and meat aficionados—but all of whom know their way around a kitchen like the back of their hand, so you’d do well to copy them. </p>
<p> Hone Those Knife Skills </p>
<p> “Always keep your fingers tucked in on your non-dominant hand, using your upper knuckles to guide your knife as you slice. If your finger tips are tucked in, you cant ever cut them! And for the highest degree of control over your knife. hold the knife by the blade, pinching the bottom of the blade between your thumb and the side of your forefinger. Grip your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle for support, and avoid laying your forefinger over the spine of the knife.” –Sydney Willcox, culinary instructor at The Brooklyn Kitchen </p>
<p> Cut Veggies Smarter </p>
<p> “Use a mandoline to cut down on prep time and ensure consistent slice sizes for your veggies.” –Willcox </p>
<p> Use Ingredients in New Ways </p>
<p> “Try a seasonal ingredient in an unexpected way! If you have never tried juicing a sweet potato you will be pleasantly surprised. The starch in potato makes your drinks lightly creamy, and the flavor combination is perfectly sweet. This is a dessert vegetable juice, packed full of vitamins A and B complex and beta-carotene.” –Matthew Kenney, raw food chef and owner of Plant Food + Wine Miami </p>
<p> @dferst </p>
<p> Don’t Forget the Garnish </p>
<p> “To make an impression on your guests, throw a simple garnish on your finished platter: mMicrogreens are easy and beautiful, or take an element from the dish, such as whole herb sprigs or extra spice, and add just a small amount to create a pop for the eye.” –Willcox </p>
<p> Blend Better </p>
<p> “Always put your liquids in your blender first—water, juice, broths—and then load your more solid ingredients—veggies, leafy greens, fruits. This takes stress off your blender motor, and as the blade spins your ingredients are more easily pulled down into the blender vessel and your blends are more consistent, smooth, and creamy. Adding your liquids first will lengthen the life of your blender and your ‘blends’ will come out perfect.” –Nina Curtis, executive chef of The Ranch Malibu </p>
<p> Turn Up the Heat </p>
<p> “Don’t be scared of the heat! If you are looking for a sear, you need to bring on high levels of heat. Without a smoking-hot pan, it will be close to impossible to achieve a crispy, caramelized browning on your steak, pork, chicken or fish. Also be sure not to overcrowd a pan when searing, otherwise the pan will cool down too much, and there will not be enough heat from the bottom of the pan or circulating around the meat in the pan.” –Willcox </p>
<p> Let Your Meat Sit Out Before Cooking </p>
<p> “If you’re going to cook a steak, for instance, take it out of your fridge and let it come to room temperature before you throw it on the grill or in the oven. A lot of times people will take meat from a cooler or a 40-degree fridge and throw it on the grill and want it medium rare. What do you think the inside is going to be? Cold, right? You have to let your meat come up to room temperature.” –Aarón Sánchez, chef at Johnny Sánchez </p>
<p> Slice Meat Properly </p>
<p> “Always slice meat against the grain, or even the most tender filet mignon can feel chewy.” –Willcox </p>
<p> Take Advantage of Salt </p>
<p> “Be sure to use a high-quality coarse salt for finishing your dishes: This is an easy way to really transcend your home cooking to restaurant-level quality. You can also use flavored salts, such as smoked salt, to add depth.” –Willcox </p>
<p> @chef_aaronsanchez </p>
<p> Don’t Cry Over Onions </p>
<p> “Put onions in ice water for 10 minutes before cutting them; this prevents them from causing your eyes to water.” –Angel Leon, executive chef at Seaspice Miami </p>
<p> Add a Drizzle of Olive Oil </p>
<p> “Take a note from Mediterranean dwellers and finish your dishes with a little drizzle of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil; it will make for a silky finish!” –Willcox </p>
<p> Get an Even Roast </p>
<p> “Be sure to rotate pans or trays in the oven: All ovens have hot spots, so spin your trays around halfway through their cooking time—and alternate racks, if you have multiple trays cooking.” –Willcox </p>

<p> Season Your Meat Properly </p>
<p> “Season your meat right before you cook it; this will keep the meat moist. If you season it hours in advance it will make the meat dry.” –Leon </p>
<p> Keep Meat Juicy </p>
<p> “Never stab the meat with a fork or knife to flip it over. These punctures allow juices to escape and can lead to drying of the meat and less-flavorful protein. Always use a spatula and/or tongs when you need to turn your meats.” –Aaron Taylor, national executive chef at STK </p>
<p> Let Meat Cool After Cooking </p>
<p> “Once any piece of meat is cooked, it’s important to let it rest about 5 to 10 minutes before slicing. The natural juices within the protein get pushed to the outside during the cooking process. Allowing it a chance to sit will help the juices to disperse throughout the center of the meat, giving it a delicious and succulent flavor.” –Taylor </p>
<p> @matthewkenneycuisine </p>
<p> Keep Herbs on Hand </p>
<p> “Always keep a fresh supply of basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary, sage, and dill.”–Kenney </p>
<p> Make Large Batches with Seasonal Ingredients </p>
<p> “Take advantage of seasonal produce. Summer is tomato time! Use that bounty to make extra marinara sauce that you can freeze and use later in the year.” –Meredith Haaz, chef at The Ranch Malibu </p>
<p> Kale Chip Tips </p>
<p> “To get crispy kale chips, be sure to dry the leaves well after washing (this will avoid them steaming in the oven). We use a salad spinner. Also, don’t drown them in oil. A half tablespoon rubbed into the leaves is all you need. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast, salt, and pepper and bake at 275 for 10 to 13 minutes.” –Haaz </p>
<p> Improve Your Salad Dressing </p>
<p> “Substitute a couple of tablespoons of tahini for oil in dressings to give them a creamy consistency.” –Haaz </p>
<p> Cook with the Right Oils </p>
<p> “Always consider the smoke point of your cooking oil: Be sure to use a fat that correlates to the level of heat you will be cooking at. Low-heat oil, such as butter and some nut oils, will burn at a medium or high temperature, so be sure to use those only when cooking on low heat. With high-heat oils, such as almond, avocado, canola, or grapeseed, you can cook at low or high temperatures without having to worry about them burning.” –Willcox </p>

<p> Get a More Flavorful Pasta </p>
<p> “Add rock salt and olive oil to water when boiling pasta. The salt will season the pasta while they are blanching, and the oil will keep them from sticking together while adding flavor to the pasta.” –Eric Damidot, executive chef, Hyatt Regency New Orleans </p>
<p> Exactly How to Sear </p>
<p> “While you are cooking fish or any protein that has a skin, make sure to heat the sauté pan to a high temperature and cook the skin side first, only flipping once. By heating the pan to a high temperature, it will instantly sear the skin to the perfect crisp and keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan, keeping it dry and crispy.” –Damidot </p>
<p> Sauté Smarter </p>
<p> “If you find you need more oil in the pan when sautéing, try substituting vegetable stock. It will help cut down on the calories but give your pan the moisture it needs.” –Haaz </p>
<p> @cleaneatingamy </p>
<p> Poach a Perfect Egg </p>
<p> “For the perfect poached egg, use a wide pot with enough water to have the egg floating an inch above the bottom of the pot, filling 2/3 with water and 1/3 with white vinegar. Water should be at a slow boil, with tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the pot. Crack the egg in a ramekin first and drop the egg slowly in the water. If the egg is fresh, the egg white will enrobe the yolk nicely and make the perfect poached egg. Cook to your liking, soft yolk or firm.” –Damidot </p>
<p> Edit What Goes Into the Pan </p>
<p> “When cooking in a pan, don’t overcrowd. This will create steam instead of direct heat.” –Chef and restaurateur Eric LeVine, partner at Paragon Tap & Table and Morris Tap & Grill </p>
<p> Freeze Your Cheese </p>
<p> “If your cheese is too soft to grate, place it in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes.” –LeVine </p>

<p> Classic Traditional Italian Recipes Illustrated Step-by-Step </p>
<p> A unique site about Italian Cooking - Step-by-step illustrated Italian food recipes for Tiramisu, and classic Italian recipes for pasta, lasagna, gnocchi, risotto, pizza, polenta, and articles on history of Italian food. </p>
<p> What is Italian Cooking? </p>
<p> About Italian Food </p>
<p> Many non-Italians identify Italian cooking with a few of its most popular dishes, like pizza and spaghetti. People often express the opinion that Italian cooking is all pretty much alike. However, those who travel through Italy notice differences in eating habits between cities, even those only a few miles apart. Not only does each region have its own style of Italian Food , but each community and each valley has a different way of Italian cooking as well. </p>
<p> Perhaps no other country in the world has a cooking style so finely fragmented into different divisions. So why is Risotto typical of Milan, why did Tortellini originate in Bologna, and why is Pizza so popular in Naples? This is so for the same reason that Italy has only one unifying Italian language, yet hundreds of different spoken dialects. Italy is a country of great variety, and Italian cooking is just another aspect of the diversity of Italian culture. This diversity in Italian food stems largely from peasant heritage and geographical differences. Italy is a peninsula separated from the rest of the continent by the highest chain of mountains in Europe. In addition, a long spine of mountains runs north to south down through this narrow country. </p>
<p> Every town has a distinctive way of making sausage, special kinds of cheese and wine, and a local type of bread. If you ask people, even in the same area, how to make pasta sauce, they will all have different answers. Variations in the omnipresent pasta are another example of the multiplicity of Italian recipes: soft egg noodles in the north, hard-boiled spaghetti in the south, with every conceivable variation in size and shape. </p>
<p> These geographic features create a myriad of environments with noticeable variations: fertile valleys, mountains covered with forests, cool foothills, rocky landscapes, Mediterranean coastlines, and arid plains. A great variety of different climates have also created innumerable unique geographical and historical areas. </p>
<p> But geographical fragmentation alone will not explain how the same country produced all of these: the rich, fat, baroque food of Bologna, based on butter, parmigiano, and meat; the light, tasty, spicy cooking of Naples, mainly based on olive oil, mozzarella, and seafood; the cuisine of Rome, rich in produce from the surrounding countryside; and the food of Sicily, full of North African influences. </p>
<p> The explanation is hidden in the past; the multitudes of food styles of Italy mainly result from its history. Divided for a long time into many duchies, princedoms, kingdoms, and states—often hostile to one another—political unification in Italy did not occur until 1861. Many populations in the past three thousand years have occupied Italian territory, and most of them contributed their own traditions. </p>

<p> Quick & Crispy Home Fries </p>
<p> "In order to get a crispy crust like the fries at your local diner you need to precook and cool them. When you pan fry a cold starch, it gets a beautifully crispy surface." </p>
<p> Directions </p>
<p> Arrange potato pieces evenly on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high until just tender, about 4 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Cut potatoes into bite-size chunks. </p>
<p> Heat butter and olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When butter melts and starts to turn brown, swirl the pan and add the potatoes. Shake pan to arrange in an even layer. Season with salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder. </p>
<p> As potatoes brown, toss them and keep turning them every few minutes until they are crusty and crispy-edged and a rich reddish-brown color, 10 to 12 minutes. If potatoes seem to be cooking too quickly, reduce heat to medium. Serve topped with chopped chives. </p>

<p> Roasted Veal with Potatoes Recipe </p>
<p> TRADITIONAL ITALIAN RECIPE: Roasted veal is a simple, elegant way to cook one of the more subtle-flavored types of meat. The secret to making a veal roast is to first, buy a good piece of meat, and second, start it on top of the stove to brown the meat. There is no Butter in this recipe. Italian tend to avoid butter in many dishes. </p>
<p> The cooking continues in the oven and an instant thermometer makes sure you don't over-cook it. </p>
<p> A veal roast can be expensive so this is a time to buy from a good butcher. Tell him how you're going to cook it and ask to have the roast tied in one-inch intervals with butchers twine. </p>
<p> Roast the veal so that it is taken out of the oven about 10 minutes before you plan to serve it. When serving, be generous with your slices, and cut the pieces in 1/2-inch slices so that each bite offers a generous taste. </p>
<p> Veal roast is a perfect centerpiece to a meal that includes a full flavored pasta or risotto, and bright green vegetables like broccolini. </p>
<p> 02 - Tie the Veal Meat and place it into a large frying pan. </p>
<p> 03 - Pour the Oil all over the Veal Meal and place Rosemary Sprigs and Sage Leaves beneath the cord. </p>
<p> 04 - Sprincle with Salt and Black Pepper. Flip the meat and sprinkle Salt and Pepper underneath too. </p>
<p> 05 - Saute' the Veal over medium fire. </p>
<p> 06 - In the meantime, peel the Potatoes and cut them into chunks. </p>
<p> 07 - Move the browned Veal in the center of a large oven dish, and place the Potatoes all aroung. </p>
<p> 08 - Sprinkle the Potatoes with Salt, Pepper, Cloves of Garlic and chopped Rosemary and Sage Leaves. </p>
<p> 09 - With a fork, pinch some deep holes in the Veal Meat and pour all over ( in this order ) White Wine, Broth and Oil. Let each fluid be absorbed by the meat for 1 meanute. </p>
<p> 10 - Bake for 1 hour. After 30 minutes, using a spoon, take some juice and pour it back over the Veal. Bake for final 30 minutes. </p>
<p> 11 - Turn the oven off. </p>
<p> 12 - Move the Potatoes from the dish to a separate plate, and the remainin juice into a small clean frying pan. Cover the dish with the Veal with kitchen foil to keep it warm into the oven. </p>
<p> 13 - Filtrate and boil the Sauce and thicken it by adding some flour. </p>
<p> 14 - Serve the Roasted Veal and Potatoes together topping with some Sauce. </p>
<p> Notes: </p>
<p> - If you want more Sauce, when you boil it, add some extra Broth, water and/or Wine. </p>
<p> - Be careful not to overcook the Roast because you might risk to ruin it. It is useful to remember that for every kg / 1.1lb of meat, it's required about 1 hour of baking. </p>

<p> King and bean from inside a Spanish Rosca de Reyes. </p>
<p> Roscón de reyes or rosca de reyes (ring of the kings) is a Latin pastry traditionally eaten to celebrate Epiphany throughout Ibero America, originally from Spain it is more commonly associated[1][2] and celebrated in Mexico[1] and Mexican diaspora throughout the world, as well as throughout the Hispanic world. Recipes vary from country to country and between cultures. </p>
<p> Roscón de reyes generally has an oval shape due to the need to make cakes large enough for large groups. For decoration, figs, quinces, cherries, or dried and candied fruits are often, but not exclusively, used.[2] It may be compared to a King Cake but is a distinct tradition from King Cake, in that it emerged from Hispanic culture and Latin America's unique observance of the holiday, but is similar to others in that it emerges from a Catholic observance of food, celebration, and reverence for the holidays.[3] </p>
<p> It is traditionally eaten on January 6,[4] during the celebration of the Día de Reyes ("Kings' Day"), which commemorates the arrival of the three Magi or Wise Men. In most of Spain, Latin America, and their Diaspora throughout the world, this is the day when children traditionally get presents, which are attributed to the Three Wise Men (as opposed to Santa Claus). In Spain before children go to bed, they leave a dish filled with biscuits and a few glasses of water for the three wise men and the camels they ride.[citation needed] The figurine of the baby Jesus hidden in the bread represents the flight of the Holy Family, fleeing from King Herod's Massacre of the Innocents. Whoever finds the baby Jesus figurine is blessed and must take the figurine to the nearest church on February 2 (Candlemas Day, Día de la Candelaria). In Mexican culture, the tradition has a long list of traditions that vary based on region and family, as well as moving away from Mexico, and centers even more around sharing food and generosity with neighbors. The person who finds the baby Jesus has the responsibility of hosting a dinner and providing tamales and atole—traditional Christmas foods, (but which are highly labor intensive) to the guests. This celebration will often includes Pozole, (a hearty warming stew for cold weather and mornings) which is made for all of one's neighbors. Other observations state that the person who finds the baby Jesus is the "comadre" or "compadre" (guardian) of Jesus for that year. </p>
<p> In Galicia and Argentina, there is a similar tradition of eating the rosca on January 6, although no figurine is included. A similar version of the pastry with whole eggs baked on top is served on Easter as rosca de Pascua. </p>
<p> In some places, the roscón de reyes is replaced by panettone, also baked with trinkets inside. </p>
<p> In northern France and Belgium, a similar pastry, known as a galette des rois (made with puff pastry and almond cream), is eaten on Epiphany, and in the US, the formerly French and Spanish city of New Orleans continues this tradition later into the year with their King Cake, a rich yeasted bread decorated with colored sugar and eaten throughout Carnival season, which begins on Epiphany and ends on Mardi Gras. </p>

<p> Rosca de Reyes for Three King's Day </p>
<p> Suzanne Barbezat is a freelance writer specializing in Mexican travel, culture, and food. </p>
<p> Rosca de Reyes is a sweet bread, which is a special food for Three King's Day, known as "Día de Reyes" in Spanish, and celebrated on January 6 in Mexico. The holiday is sometimes referred to as the Twelfth Night because it falls twelve days after Christmas, but is also known as Epiphany, and marks the day the Wise Men or Magi, Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar, are believed to have visited the Christ Child. On this day, Mexican children receive gifts from the three kings, sometimes placed in shoes that the children have left out overnight and placed hay in as a gift of food for the kings' animals. </p>
<p> "Rosca" means wreath and "Reyes" means kings, so a direct translation of Rosca de Reyes would be "Kings' Wreath". The sweet bread is shaped in the form of a wreath and usually has candied fruit on top, and a figurine of a baby baked inside (now made of plastic but previously they were porcelain or tin). This special treat is often simply called "Rosca." The traditions surrounding this sweet bread is similar to the custom of eating King Cake in New Orleans during Carnival season. </p>
<p> In Mexico, it is customary for friends and family to get together on January 6 to eat Rosca, usually accompanied by hot chocolate or another warm drink such as coffee or atole. Usually, each person cuts their own slice and the one who gets a piece of Rosca with the baby figurine is expected to host a party on Día de la Candelaria (Candlemas), which is celebrated on February 2nd. On that day, the traditional food is tamales. Nowadays bakers tend to put several baby figurines in the Rosca, so the responsibility for making (or buying) the tamales can be shared among several people. </p>
<p> Symbolism </p>
<p> The symbolism of the Rosca de Reyes speaks of the Biblical story of Mary and Joseph's flight to Egypt to protect the infant Jesus from the slaughter of the innocents. The shape of the Rosca symbolizes a crown, in this case, the crown of King Herod from whom they were trying to hide the infant Jesus. The dried fruit placed on top are jewels on the crown. The figurine in the Rosca represents baby Jesus in hiding. The person who finds the baby Jesus is symbolically his godparent and must sponsor the party when he is taken to the temple to be blessed, celebrated as Día de la Candelaria, or Candlemas, on February 2nd. </p>
<p> Where to Try It </p>
<p> If you travel to Mexico during the period after Christmas and up to around the second week of January, you will find Roscas for sale in bakeries throughout the country. There are a number of variations, but the classic Rosca is made with butter and has some orange zest in it to give it just a slight citrus flavor. The top is usually decorated with candied citrus fruit and cherries and a quince paste known in Mexico as ate (pronounced “ah-teh”). Rosca is spongy inside and just a bit sweet. The candied fruit and sweets on top give it more sweetness. Some bakeries make special versions with different types of fillings such as custard, cream, or jam, and different toppings, and you can even find some that are chocolate flavored. </p>
<p> There are several bakeries In Mexico City that are known for producing particularly tasty Roscas. One of the most popular bakeries is El Globo, which has several locations throughout the city. For an authentic and impressive experience, head to the Centro Historico location of Pasteleria Ideal, which is a large bakery and cake shop, and before purchasing your Rosca, make a visit to the second floor where you can see a huge exhibit of display cakes which serve as a catalog for people ordering cakes for large parties and events. Another bakery with a long tradition of making Rosca is La Vasconia, which also has a restaurant section, in case you would like to sit down and have your Rosca there. </p>
<p> Order or Make It </p>
<p> If you won't be traveling in Mexico during this season, you can get your own Rosca delivered to your home by ordering online from MexGrocer, or if you're feeling ambitious, you can make your own. Remember if you host a get together for Día de Reyes, you should let each guest cut their own slice of Rosca, so whoever gets the baby figurine will have no one to blame but themselves, and you can expect a feast in February. </p>
<p> Rosca de Reyes is very similar to what is known in the Southern United States as King Cake, and the provenance of the custom is the same, with origins in Spain, but King Cake is eaten during the Mardi Gras celebrations prior to Lent instead of during the Christmas season. </p>

<p> Rosca de Reyes is a Mexican Tradition </p>
<p> Rosca de Reyes, a Mexican tradition and religious holiday En Español </p>
<p> The Rosca de Reyes, or ring-shaped Rosca de Reyes is a sweet round, cake or oval shape Mexican bread, decorated with slices of crystallized or candied fruit colors. The King cake is also called: biscuit, cake or sweet bread to celebrate the three kings. </p>
<p> The celebration of Epiphany to enjoy the Rosca de Reyes is a Mexican tradition that takes place, 12 days after Christmas, each year in social reunions with family, friends or colleagues in offices or homes. This meeting is usually done a few days before or after January 6 at the offices or places outside the home, however for the family reunions they are normally held in homes on the sixth day of January in the evening, Epiphany Day or the appearance of the Wise Men or Magi Kings: Balthazar, Melchior and Caspar. </p>
<p> This tradition of eating together and sharing a rosca de reyes bread with a hot chocolate to remember the Holy Kings, is made as a snack or pre-dinner at an early hour in the late evening, so that children are present and can participate in the tradition of getting together to enjoy and share a slice of rosca de reyes </p>
<p> and it is important when you cut a slice, that on both sides of the rosca, does not appear the figure of the infant Jesus (plastic doll symbolizing Jesus newborn). It is worth to mention that also a small showing inside may bearly appear in the sweet bread. Now in days another figure of a Wise Men of plastic may be hidden inside the bread, so that two people who are to split the party cost. It is said that the person who finds the baby Jesus, should put the house for a party on Candlemas Day on February 2. On this day your guest are expecting to eat tamales and Mexican appetizers, so it is important to re-join the same group that was present when the rosca was cut. Incidentally, the person who finds the plastic wise man or Magi King in his or hers slice, normally must pay the costs of the party, in reality the expenses of the party is shared by both persons. It is considered to have good luck and that you are fortunate if you find the baby Jesus and/or the Wise Man. </p>
<p> The tradition of holding the reunion to celebrate the Day of the Epiphany comes from the middle ages in Europe, mainly from Spain and France. This tradition came to Mexico at the time of the early years of the viceroys. </p>

<p> Por Dios, la rosca de Reyes es una tradicion que se origino en EEESSSPPAAAAANNAAAAA! Y de ahi paso a toda America Latina, no solo a Mexico. No se puede ser tan ignorantes! </p>
<p> thanks for your help.I help a french girl friend of mine ,traducing spanish mails that she receives from mexicans girl friends.The mail about their epithany tradition was in a incomprehensible french and i needed to know better about the mexican tradition .Denyse from France </p>
<p> It is not a Mexican tradition; started in Rome before the 3rd century. The tradition was brought to México by Spanish conquistadors. The roots of this tradition are not Catholic, but, yes, it is religious. =====. No es una tradición mexicana; comenzó en Roma antes del Siglo III (que fue cuando por primera vez se introdujo la sorpresa). La costumbre fue traida a México por los españoles. Las raices no son católicas pero si religiosas, </p>

<p> One pan Italian Sauteed Shrimp, just five ingredients makes this a quick and easy shrimp recipe. The perfect anytime dinner idea. </p>
<p> Italian Sauteed Shrimp </p>
<p> I love going to those steak houses in Canada and eating those huge shrimp with cocktail sauce. Or a get together, well I am the first one looking for one of those shrimp rings. </p>
<p> To tell the truth, when I am back home I still think that way. But here there are no shrimp rings with cocktail sauce, but there are shrimp. </p>
<p> The first time I had Sautéed Shrimp was when I was newly married, and my husband and I were invited to our very good friends’ house for dinner. </p>
<p> I knew I was in for something tasty, since she is such an amazing cook. And she didn’t let me down. Naturally I was in the kitchen watching and making notes of every step. </p>
<p> How to make Sauteed Shrimp </p>
<p> In a large pan add olive oil, garlic cook for approximately 30 seconds, then add the shrimp, sprinkle with salt and chopped parsley. </p>
<p> Cook for approximately 5-6 minutes or until shrimp is pink and opaque. Stirring often. Serve immediately. </p>
<p> Can you use frozen shrimp? </p>
<p> Peeled, frozen or fresh shrimp are all perfect for this seafood recipe. If you use frozen, place the shrimp in a colander and rinse under cold water, this will thaw them enough for cooking. </p>
<p> I even use unpeeled shrimp sometimes and you can call it the Italian Peel and Eat version! </p>

<p> Now this is something I can get behind! We sometimes cook shrimp, usually lightly in garlic butter, not too much different to this 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi Scott, thanks, I’m sure it is really good with butter, you should try it sometime with olive oil. </p>
<p> Oh this looks delicious. This may be perfect for a date night in with my husband! </p>

<p> Scrumptious Chops </p>
<p> My honey had to work this Valentine’s Day, so I wanted to make him an extra nice meal. I found a recipe for chops, picked up some asparagus and key lime pie. I was very excited to be preparing so many of his favorites. Little did I know he hates asparagus, and the onions in the chop recipe left him cold. Oops. His exact quote was “who is this dinner for?” Despite my bad menu choices, he loved the venison (he just didn’t eat the onions, but did like the flavor the sauce added to the meat). </p>
<p> Once again, I have Suzanne Somers to thank for the meal. I think my grandmother used to do something similar, though…the taste was very familiar and comforting to me. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 200. </p>
<p> Season chops with salt and pepper. Heat skillet on medium high. Melt 2 tbs of the butter in the pan. Pan sear the chops for about 5 minutes, until the outside is golden brown, then turn over and continue cooking for another five minutes. Remove chops from pan and put in warm oven. </p>
<p> Add the onion to the skillet (and more butter if pan looks too dry) and cook until browned. </p>
<p> Add the shallots and garlic and cook for another minute. </p>
<p> Pour red wine into pan and bring to boil. Turn the heat down to simmer, and cook until wine is reduced by half (about 3 to 4 minutes). </p>
<p> Add the remaining butter, stirring to melt. </p>
<p> Whisk in the cream. Season with additional salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Return the chops to the pan and heat for 2 minutes. </p>

<p> Feb 24 Setting the Table with Family Traditions </p>
<p> One of the main reasons that food has played such a big part in my life is because my mom is an excellent cook. If you follow me, you might know that she had a catering business and later my parents had a Japanese market. </p>
<p> Recently I hosted my family for dinner. I decided to serve a traditional Japanese meal and settled on temaki. What is temaki? They're Japanese hand rolls. You begin with a sheet of nori (dried seaweed) and then you roll in raw fish, rice, and other fresh ingredients like cucumber, avocado, wasabi, sesame seeds, etc. It's a delicious and simple meal and it's fun to be interactive and get creative with your rolls. At the dinner my brother-in-law lightly chided my sister (his wife) and our mother. Why had they never introduced him to temaki before in the many years that he has been a part of our family? Although we got a good laugh it made me realize the importance of reproducing family food traditions. </p>
<p> A few months later, when I had all four of my kids in town, we decided to host another family meal. Again, I thought of sentimental food traditions I had growing up. What food tradition did I want to share with my children and my niece? Obviously my sister and mom weren't going to carry the torch and the weight had fallen to me (I joke. I have an awesome sister and mom and they are great with this generation of kids). </p>
<p> I settled on sukiyaki. Sukiyaki is a nabe or hot pot dish, where you cook all the ingredients at the table in a well seasoned broth. Traditionally it is made with thinly sliced beef. I had to revise this tradition and in addition to the beef sukiyaki I served a vegetarian option as well for our resident vegetarian (my now wife). </p>
<p> All my kids had a great time walking to the corner Japanese market to select the ingredients. It gave me the opportunity to share stories with them about their grandparents store. At home the kids were also eager to help prepare and cook the food and it was good to know that one day they'll have the knowledge to continue these food traditions. </p>
<p> These dinners made me think of other simple food traditions that I enjoyed when I was a kid. One was a very typical New Yorker breakfast experience. The bagel spread. This involves authentic NYC bagels, schmear (aka cream cheese), lox, tomato, onion, and capers. Voila! The best breakfast. </p>
<p> During another visit when my kids were with us in NYC we put an awesome bagel spread together for breakfast for them. They loved it. My oldest son King thought it was awesome. In an almost accusatory way he said "Dad! Why have you never done this for us before?!" The answer was simple. "Seattle doesn't have good bagels." I dead panned. But truthfully carrying on food traditions often takes thought and planning. </p>
<p> I love learning the food traditions of other families and I've been fortunate to take part in them. This past Lunar New Year, I was invited to my friend Dorothy's house to celebrate. She put all of the guests, my kids included, to work learning to roll and fold the dumplings. It was a lot of fun. </p>
<p> I know a lot of people out there, cooks or not, who don't put an emphasis on carrying on food traditions. I think it's important because it's an opportunity to share stories and to pass on knowledge that often has been passed on for several generations. </p>
<p> What a cool way to feel connected to people who came even hundreds of years before. </p>
<p> Even if you don't have any traditions, any day is a good day to start one. Once you do, you can pass it on to your friends and family. Once you start there will be someone to carry it on. </p>
<p> So, please share with me some of your favorite food traditions. What do you enjoy to cook? Is it associated with a holiday? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments below. </p>

<p> Sheet-Pan Italian Pork Chops Make the Easiest Keto Weeknight Dinner </p>
<p> Pork chops are great for busy weeknights because there's not a lot of prep and they cook quickly. You can turn them into a sheet pan keto dinner by baking them with some hearty vegetables—cleanup will be easy, and you won't sacrifice flavor by skimping on the pots and pans. Plus, believe it or not, pork is one of the lightest meats you can eat, especially when trying to lose weight. </p>
<p> The key to a good pork chop, especially a keto-friendly pork chop, is the layer of fat around the edges. The fat is crucial to flavoring a piece of meat. Use bone-in chops when you can for better flavor, but even if you choose boneless, make sure your chops have some fat. As for the vegetables, broccoli and peppers work well, but the beauty of this dish is that you can use any seasonal vegetables (asparagus, carrots, Brussels sprouts). Along with the veggies, dried herbs, salt, and olive oil will impart delicious Italian flavors. </p>
<p> Makes 2 servings </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> FOR THE PORK CHOPS 2 boneless pork chops, ¾-inch thick 1 Tbsp olive oil ¼ tsp Italian seasoning ⅛ tsp salt ⅛ tsp black pepper </p>
<p> FOR THE VEGETABLES 4 cups fresh broccoli florets ¼ cup coarsely chopped bell pepper 2 Tbsp olive oil ⅛ tsp salt Dash red pepper flakes </p>
<p> FOR SERVING 3 Tbsp olive oil ¼ cup pitted green or black olives, quartered ¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese Lemon slices </p>
<p> How to Make It </p>
<p> Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper. On a cutting board, pound pork chops with a mallet to tenderize. Place chops in the center of the prepared baking pan. </p>
<p> Brush pork chops with oil and sprinkle with Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Bake 10 minutes. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine broccoli, bell pepper, oil, salt, and red pepper flakes; mix well. Spread vegetable mixture around pork chops. Bake 20 minutes, stirring once, or until slightly crisp but still tender. Use an instant-read thermometer to ensure the internal temperature of the pork is at least 145°F. </p>
<p> Transfer meat and vegetables to plates. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with olives and Parmesan. Serve with lemon slices. </p>

<p> We visited this restaurant when we couldn't get into a flashier place. Pan Roma is your traditinoal Italian Restaurant with family atmosphere. The menu delivers a reasonable range of classic dishes of Italian cuisine - pastas, carni (meat) and pesce (fish). The staff are friendly and unassuming and the servings adequate. We tried zucchini flowers, shared the crab ravioli (freshly made) and spaghetti Palermo-style with anchovies, raisins and pine nuts (exquisite combination). Mains we had roasted quail and flounder - whole grilled and filletted with eggplant and roasted peppers. Homemade cheesecake and affogati to finish with limoncello. Take the family or go with friends. </p>

<p> Simple Italian Pan Fried Fish </p>
<p> Share </p>
<p> I know I always say I’m not a great fish lover, and that is the truth, even though I seem to be doing more than enough fish for someone who says otherwise. But I will say, when it is done right it can be really delicious. And this Simple Italian Pan Fried Fish is pretty darn good. </p>
<p> One thing you learn about Italian food is that just because it is fast and simple doesn’t mean it has to be tasteless. Italian food, especially Italian fish recipes, are anything but that. </p>
<p> I know that in some places it is really difficult to find fresh fish, but I cook frozen fish this way also. For this dish I used Perch but I am sure you can substitute it with your favorite. </p>
<p> Italians love fish, in any and every way. My husband and our friends are always planning new get togethers just so they have an excuse to eat fish. </p>
<p> The menu usually consists of an Appetizer, a Pasta and of course a Fish Main Course. But this Simple Italian Pan Fried Fish is the perfect weeknight meal, fast, easy and healthy. </p>
<p> Simple Italian Pan Fried Fish </p>
<p> The last time I made this I also made the Parmesan Potato Ham Bake, it was a tasty accompaniment to the fish. </p>
<p> The Simple Italian Pan Fried Fish is a one skillet dish, which is pretty well the best kind, made with some healthy olive oil, fresh chopped Italian parsley and of course a few slices of lemon. Buon Appetito! </p>
<p> Simple Italian Pan Fried Fish </p>
<p> Italian Pan Fried Fish, an easy, simple delicious and healthy fish recipe, 4 ingredients make this dish a family favorite fish dish. Paleo. </p>

<p> slices **I like the thicker of fish for pan frying but even thin will work. </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Place fish slices on a plate and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper (pepper if desired). </p>
<p> In a medium-large skillet, on medium-high heat warm the olive oil, add fish (seasoned side down), then sprinkle the other side with a pinch of salt (and pepper if desired) top with chopped parsley and lemon slices, cook 5 minutes then flip over and cook for an additional 3 or 4 minutes until fish is cooked (opaque and flakes, not transparent).

<p> This was incredibly easy, quick, and delicious. I love how it made it’s own sauce which we scooped up with crusty bread. </p>
<p> Hi Jodi, thanks so much, so glad you enjoyed it and yes can’t forget the crust bread! 🙂 </p>
<p> I love this template for cooking fish simply. It works for just about any filet and with salad and a vegetable, it’s a fabulous weeknight dinner. </p>
<p> We eat a lot of fish, cod, salmon and striped bass mostly. Hubby is a fantastic fisherman he catches the bass and the cold and salmon come from the local market. This recipe looks fantastic my friend xo </p>
<p> I want to cook with fish more – this looks really light and healthy. I used to think frozen fish was terrible, but have learned that if you defrost it properly (and buy quality fish, of course) that it can turn out just as good as fresh. Feeling inspired after reading your post! 🙂 </p>
<p> Hi April, I totally agree, I think a lot of it depends on how food is cooked. Have a great day. </p>
<p> Well it’s a good thing we love fish in any form. The only kind of fish I (we) don’t care for is catfish — really fishy smelly as well as mackerel. To me they both smell worse than cat food. I love the simplicity of your ingredients. For great taste you really don’t need a whole lot, do you?? Thank you for sharing. We’re having tilapia tonight — fishing is still slow here so we had to buy the fish. </p>
<p> Hi Marisa, to tell the truth I haven’t never eaten catfish (maybe it’s the name)! Have a great day. </p>

<p> Pan-Fried Pork Chops </p>
<p> Okay, people. Let’s get down to business here. Let’s get down to basics, let’s get down to brass tacks, let’s get down to the nitty gritty… </p>
<p> Let’s fry up some pork chops. </p>
<p> Okay, if rocket science were people, these pork chops would be…Antarctica. These are the simplest, most delightful little numbers—ready in 5 to 10 minutes, flavorful, and exceedingly man-pleasing. And again, I don’t intend to be a walking, breathing affront to feminism with statements like that. It just so happens that I am a raging feminist. I believe in raising my daughters to be creative and confident women who can find equal contentment standing on their own two feet or raising a family with a man, if he’s the right match. I believe in equal opportunities for men and women, and I believe that women can do anything men can do. </p>
<p> Except that lumberjack stuff. That would be pretty tough. </p>
<p> I also believe that a woman can be strong and independent while also deriving joy from watching a huge grin sweep across her husband’s face when he bites into something he finds delicious. </p>
<p> I am woman. Hear me roar. But my husband’s tastebuds I can not ignore. And if I make the pork chops he will melt… </p>
<p> Or something like that. </p>
<p> My Lord, can I ever write the worst recipe headnotes. I should be fired. </p>
<p> Plate #1: Flour…seasoned salt (any seasoned salt will do; I use Lawry’s.)…cayenne pepper, if you’ve got the guts. </p>
<p> Plenty of ground black pepper. </p>
<p> Stir it together with a fork until it’s nice and combined. </p>
<p> Plate #2: Pork Breakfast Chops, or Breakfast Pork Chops. Basically, these are bone-in pork chops that are cut extremely thin. There are as many different incarnations of “pork chops” as there are grains of sand in all the beaches of the world (hyperbole much?) but just look for the thinnest cut—bone still in—as you can find. Sprinkle each side with table salt… </p>
<p> (I usually use kosher salt to season meat, but pork chops are just too down-home for that.) </p>
<p> Next comes plenty of ground black pepper. </p>
<p> Again: no freshly ground tri-color peppercorns will do here. We need the black dust in the can. </p>
<p> Here’s the deal: I’m a lazy person. And as a lazy person, I just can’t be bothered with painstakingly seasoning both sides of every pork chop in a batch before moving forward. So I just season one side, then plop it, seasoned side down, onto the flour mixture. </p>
<p> Then salt and pepper the other side. </p>
<p> Flip it over and cover the other side in flour… </p>
<p> Then shake off the excess flour… </p>
<p> And place them on a clean plate, which I think at this point would be Plate #3 or Plate #33 or Plate #3,333,333 or something. </p>
<p> Now heat 1/2 cup canola oil in a large skillet, preferably a nonstick skillet that’s lost a lot of its nonstick coating. </p>
<p> Not really. I don’t recommend that. It’s just that if you had one of those, too, I’d feel much better about myself. </p>
<p> Add 2 tablespoons butter to the oil. This’ll help the pork chops achieve a nice golden brown color, and some added flavor too. </p>
<p> Let the butter melt completely… </p>
<p> Make sure the oil’s hot (medium heat), then add three pork chops to the skillet. </p>
<p> Let them cook and sizzle and cook and sizzle. Cook on the first side for 2 to 3 minutes. </p>
<p> I watch the edges of the pork chops; I want them to get pretty golden brown before I flip them over. </p>
<p> Then flip ’em over! I use clean tongs for this, because raw pork grosses me out the door. </p>
<p> Cook the second side for 1 to 2 minutes. You definitely want the meat done all the way through, but since they’re so thin it doesn’t take long! </p>
<p> When they’re done, remove the pork chops to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with the other pork chops till they’re all done. </p>
<p> In keeping with the I-don’t-want-to-exert-myself-tonight dinner theme, violently grab a handful of small new potatoes. Poke them with a fork a couple of times, then nuke ’em for five minutes (until fork tender.) Throw them on a big plate (Plate #4?) with a bunch of butter, salt, and pepper, then cut and smash ’em up so they’re nice and combined. Then serve </p>
<p> And sure, you could throw in some bacon and chives…but that would take more energy than I’m willing to expend. </p>
<p> The food’s BROWN, HOT, and PLENTY OF IT. That’s the best I can do tonight. </p>
<p> If you think this isn’t Marlboro Man’s idea of a perfect meal (there’s an iceberg wedge with ranch dressing over to the side), then…you don’t know Marlboro Man. </p>
<p> Pepper, seasoning…tons of surface area in relation to the meat inside. </p>
<p> That means flavor, baby. </p>
<p> Make a low-effort dinner tonight—I give you permission! </p>
<p> Rinse pork chops. (Yes, I rinse my pork chops. Please don’t be hatin’.) Salt and pepper both sides of the pork chops. </p>
<p> Combine all dry ingredients. Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, then set aside on a plate. </p>
<p> Heat canola oil over medium to medium-high heat. Add butter. When butter is melted and butter/oil mixture is hot, cook 3 pork chops at a time, 2 to 3 minutes on the first side; 1 to 2 minutes on the other side. (Make sure no pink juices remain.) Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining porch chops. </p>
<p> Delicious and simple! Serve with smashed new potatoes. </p>

<p> Mmm… and you’re right – mashed potatoes would be a perfect side dish! </p>
<p> I always have a terrible time with pan-fried pork chops being too tough, but maybe it’s because my pork chop cuts are too thick? Either way, this looks delicious – will keep in mind for another pork chop try! </p>

<p> –>That looks rather easy to do. We had pork chops the other night on the grill and smothered and covered them in bbq sauce. Winter is coming which means less grilling at the beach. (sigh) </p>

<p> Simple Pork and Sauerkraut Recipes </p>
<p> Pork and Sauerkraut taste great together. Here are classic pork loin and sauerkraut and sausage and sauerkraut recipes that we make on New Years Day and throughout the year! </p>
<p> I’ve long known that it’s a tradition to eat pork and sauerkraut on New Years Day, so I started asking friends what recipe they use. Turns out, that people enjoy practically all cuts of pork with sauerkraut to ring in the New Year. And some people that really love fermented food and have a German heritage (like my husband) love eating these dishes all year around! </p>
<p> {Referral links are used in this post} </p>
<p> Basic Pork and Sauerkraut Recipes </p>
<p> Simple Pork and Sauerkraut Recipes </p>
<p> My husband grew up eating smoked sausage and kraut on a regular basis. This was not just a January 1st tradition in the house with German heritage on both sides of the family. This was ie of the staple meals in his family on a regular basis, so his mom makes it in the crockpot, oven, skillet. He just likes eating it, so he wasn’t concerned with how it’s cooked. </p>
<p> I’ve even converted a reicpe for the Instant Pot to make Pork Chops, Sauerkraut and Bacon. This version uses rinsed sauerkraut, a practice that my husband is not a fan of. He likes all of the flavor and prefers that rinsing be avoided at all costs. </p>
<p> This recipe and these pictures equal true love to him. </p>
<p> Should Brown Sugar Be Added To Sauerkraut? </p>
<p> Growing up my mom always made (and still does) pork and sauerkraut to begin the year. She makes country style ribs some years and a pork loin roast other years. My mom typically adds brown sugar to her sauerkraut, while my mother in law does not. So, personal preference wins the question of whether or not to add brown sugar to sauerkraut. </p>
<p> Traditional Sauerkraut and Pork Recipes </p>
<p> I’ve heard some people add a can of beer as a tradition, but neither of our families has done that. </p>
<p> With all of these options, we did the only logical thing, we tried more than one! We purchased fully cooked smoked sausage and heated it up in a skillet over medium-high heat. Then we added the sauerkraut and heated it up. Here is the skillet that we use. This is my husband’s favorite option. The smoked sausage has a great flavor and the sauerkraut, well if you like sauerkraut you’ll like this. </p>
<p> We also seasoned half of a boneless with salt and pepper, piled the sauerkraut on top and roasted it in a covered pan until the loin reached an internal temperature of 150 Fahrenheit. I was aiming for 145º Fahrenheit, but I got distracted. Next time I’ll set the timer to avoid getting distracted! Here is the roasting pan that we use. </p>
<p> Choosing a cut of pork can be a bit overwhelming, so I like to reference Pork.org when searching for good information about pork. Since so many cuts are popular there are handy resources on the cuts of pork page on Pork.org. </p>
<p> How to Make Sausage and Sauerkraut in a Skillet </p>
<p> Cut smoked sausage into smaller chunks or bite-sized pieces. </p>
<p> Warm pre-cooked smoked sausage over medium-high heat in a skillet. </p>
<p> Set sausage aside and heat sauerkraut. Stir in brown sugar if desired. </p>
<p> As the sauerkraut gets warm add sausage. Serve and enjoy! </p>
<p> How to Make Pork Loin and Sauerkraut </p>
<p> Preheat oven to 350º Fahrenheit and coat roasting pan with non-stick spray. </p>
<p> Place pork loin in roasting pan and season with salt and pepper. </p>
<p> Pile sauerkraut on top of pork loin and cover with a lid. </p>
<p> Roast for pork for 10 – 15 minutes per pound. Use a meat thermometer to cook pork to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>

<p> Smothered pork chops are a Southern comfort classic featuring pan-fried pork chops covered in a simple but super savory onion gravy. This smothered pork chops recipe is great over white rice, which soaks up the delicious sauce and makes this down-home dish a feast. </p>
<p> Steps to Make It </p>
<p> Hide Images </p>
<p> Gather the ingredients. </p>
<p> Season pork chops on both sides with the poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. </p>
<p> Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, brown the pork chops well, about 5 minutes per side. </p>
<p> Remove from the pan and reserve on a plate. </p>
<p> Pour off the excess oil and place the pan back on the stove over medium heat. Add the butter and the onions, along with a big pinch of salt. </p>
<p> Sauté for about 10 minutes, or until the onions are well-browned. The onions need to caramelize for the best results. </p>
<p> Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute. </p>
<p> Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes. </p>
<p> Add the chicken broth, buttermilk, and water. As the mixture comes to a simmer, use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. </p>
<p> Turn the heat to low and let the onion gravy gently simmer for 15 minutes. Add a splash of water if it seems to be getting too thick.​ </p>
<p> Add the pork chops and any juices back into the pan and coat with the gravy. Cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pork is as done as you like; the internal temperature must reach at least 145 F for a safe level of doneness. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. </p>
<p> Serve pork chops over white rice topped with the onion gravy. </p>
<p> Enjoy! </p>
<p> Serving Suggestions </p>
<p> Smothered pork chops with onion gravy over rice is hearty comfort food that doesn't need much in the way of sides. </p>
<p> Cornbread and corn muffins are always tasty partners with anything that features pork. </p>
<p> Or substitute French or sourdough bread for a milder flavor. </p>
<p> Garlic toast adds some crunchy texture. </p>
<p> Add a cooked green vegetable like broccoli, peas, green or lima beans to the plate and you have a hearty, balanced meal. </p>
<p> Even though pork is technically white meat, rich smothered pork chops in onion gravy call for equally bold flavor. </p>
<p> Try pinot noir or shiraz for a satisfying pairing. </p>
<p> I don't like this at all. It's not the worst. Sure, this will do. I'm a fan—would recommend. Amazing! I love it! Thanks for your rating! </p>

<p> Some Italian Wedding Traditions </p>
<p> Some Italian Wedding Traditions </p>
<p> So they don’t see each other the night before the big event, the bride and groom will usually have separate evening meals with their respective family and friends. </p>
<p> On the morning of the wedding the groom will either deliver the bridal bouquet to the bride’s house or wait outside the ceremony venue and present the bride her bouquet upon her arrival. </p>
<p> The bridal bouquet is usually a gift from the groom’s family and its colour and design are meant to be a surprise to the bride. </p>
<p> Wedding guests will wait outside the ceremony venue for the bride to arrive and then follow the bride and groom inside for the ceremony to commence. </p>
<p> The groom will usually accompany his mother up the aisle. </p>
<p> When the bride reaches the altar, she will often hand one bloom or stem from her bouquet to the groom’s mother. </p>
<p> Often when the bride leaves her home, someone will have tied a white ribbon over her front door or gate which she must cut. A white ribbon may also be tied in front of the ceremony venue to symbolize the bond between the bride and groom. </p>
<p> It is considered bad luck to wear any gold on the day of the wedding until the wedding rings are exchanged. </p>
<p> At the wedding reception each guest is given a Bomboniere. This Italian wedding tradition is the original version of favours and the Bombonieri are 5 sugared almonds wrapped in lace. The almonds symbolize health, wealth, fertility, happiness & long life. </p>
<p> Before the wedding meal begins the best man will serve the guests sweet liquor so they can toast to the happiness of the couple. </p>
<p> At the reception the best man will cut the groom’s tie into little pieces and auction it to the guests. The bride and groom get to keep the proceeds from the auction! </p>
<p> The brides entrance – as guests wait outside the ceremony venue for the bride to arrive, there is not the same buildup inside the ceremony venue waiting for the doors to burst open and the bride to walk down the aisle. </p>
<p> The first dance will take place before the evening meal. Upon entering the reception, the newly weds are introduced and take their first dance followed by the bridal party and then the rest of the wedding guests. </p>
<p> At Italian weddings there is no “top table”. </p>
<p> Saying the term “Auguri” which means congratulations. You may hear people say that a lot, especially if you have a photo shot in the local town where your wedding is taking place – the Italians love weddings! </p>

<p> Sous Vide Thick Cut Pork Chops with Rosemary Garlic Pan Sauce </p>
<p> Sous Vide Thick Cut Pork Chops with Rosemary Garlic Pan Sauce </p>
<p> It’s New Years week, and I’m taking a break. I should be doing a pork and sauerkraut recipe, a New Year’s tradition for my in-laws. Instead, I’m relaxing on the sofa, while my second Christmas roast is cooking in the oven,2I get together with my immediate family for the Vrobel Family Christmas a few days after the holiday, to give us time together after we visit the other sides of the family. and finishing up a recipe I wrote a few months ago. </p>
<p> Instead of pork and sauerkraut, here are sous vide pork chops. I want my pork chops medium, 140°F, with just a hint of pink in the middle. Sous vide gives me precise temperature control, making it easy to cook the chops exactly how I like them. I brine the chops for flavor, and to add some juiciness to the meat. I like a hint of sweet with my pork chops, so I add a little sugar into my brine, which also helps the chops sear quickly. </p>
<p> I need a pan sauce with my pork chops – need it, I tell you! After searing the chops, I make a traditional pan sauce, with some garlic, rosemary, and chicken broth. The thing is, I hate to waste the pork juices in the sous vide bag. But, when I add them to the pan sauce, the protein left in the bag coagulates and foams up – and it looks ugly. I skim it off as best I can, but I can’t get rid of all of it. If you want a pretty sauce, skip the “add the juices from the bag” step. </p>
<p> Recipe: Sous Vide Thick Cut Pork Chops with Rosemary Garlic Pan Sauce </p>
<p> Sous Vide Thick Cut Pork Chops with Rosemary Garlic Pan Sauce </p>
<p> Description </p>
<p> Sous Vide Thick Cut Pork Chops with a simple pan sauce. Perfect medium pork – juicy with a hint of pink in the middle. </p>
<p> Scale 1x2x3x </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Brine </p>
<p> 4 cups water </p>
<p> 1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 2 tablespoons table salt </p>
<p> Chops </p>
<p> Pan Sauce </p>
<p> Juices from sous vide bags (optional) </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Brine the pork chops: In a container large enough to hold the pork chops, dIssolve the salt and sugar, then submerge the chops. Brine the chops in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, preferably 4 to 8 hours. </p>
<p> Sous Vide the pork chops: Remove the pork chops from the brine, and pat dry with paper towels. Vacuum seal the chops in medium (quart) vacuum pouches. Set the sous vide to 140°F/60°C, drop the pork chops in the sous vide, and cook for 1 to 4 hours. </p>
<p> Sear the pork chops: While the chops are cooking sous vide, preheat the pan over medium-high heat. (I preheat my cast iron pan in a 425°F oven for at least 20 minutes, then move it to the stove top over medium-high heat.) Remove the chops from the vacuum bags, saving as much liquid in the bags as possible, and dry the chops with paper towels. Swirl the vegetable oil into the pan, coating the bottom, then add the pork chops. Sear the chops until they are browned, about 1 minute a side. Remove to a platter. </p>
<p> Make the pan sauce: Add the garlic clove and rosemary sprig to the pan and cook until just fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk in the chicken broth, scraping any brown bits loose from the bottom of the pan. Add the juices from the sous vide bags (optional step). Bring to a boil and boil vigorously until reduced by half, about 5 minutes, skimming any foam from the top of the sauce. Remove from the heat, discard the garlic clove and rosemary sprig, and then whisk in the butter. Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper if needed. You want the sauce to be heavily seasoned, and it will need pepper, but watch the salt – the sous vide bag juices are already salty from the brine. Pour the sauce from the pan into a serving bowl, add the juices from the bottom of the pork chop platter, and serve, passing the sauce at the table. </p>
<p> Notes </p>
<p> Adding the sous vide bag juices to the sauce is optional – it will foam up and look ugly, but I like the added flavor. </p>

<p> Notes </p>
<p> Want to freeze these chops to cook later? Brine and vacuum seal the chops, then freeze them for up to 3 months before cooking. Add an extra half hour to the cooking time – go for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. </p>
<p> No sous vide setup? Use a beer cooler, a thermometer, and hot water: Beer Cooler Sous Vide. </p>

<p> Italian Sponge Cake – Pan di Spagna </p>
<p> Share </p>
<p> This Italian Sponge Cake, also known as Pan di Spagna has only four ingredients, pastry flour, sugar, eggs and baking powder. My mother-in-law’s traditional Italian recipe. </p>
<p> I love using this Sponge Cake recipe to make one of the best Tiramisu I have ever tasted! </p>
<p> Italian Sponge Cake </p>
<p> I first saw my mother-in-law preparing her Homemade Sponge Cake a long time ago, which by the way, she made by hand with a wire whisk! It turns out my sister-in-law was going to prepare one of the most delicious desserts. That’s right, a Tiramisu. </p>
<p> It’s still one of my favourites right after Cheesecake, I can never get enough Cheesecake, although you could combine the two and make a Tiramisu Cheesecake. </p>
<p> In the Italian Baking and Pastry making (Pasticceria) Sponge Cake or Pan di Spagna in Italian, is considered one of the most important staples. A very simple recipe, that does need some attention. </p>
<p> How to make Sponge Cake </p>
<p> In a large bowl beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy about 5 minutes. </p>
<p> Then add the flour and baking powder and beat for 2-3 minutes until smooth. </p>
<p> Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake for 30-35 minutes. </p>
<p> More Sponge Cake Recipes </p>
<p> What are the differences between Cakes </p>
<p> Chiffon Cake – A traditional chiffon cake is made with whipped egg whites along with baking powder to rise. </p>
<p> Yellow Cake – A yellow cake is lighter in texture than a pound cake and has more eggs. </p>
<p> Pound Cake – A cake traditionally made with a pound of butter, flour, eggs and sugar. </p>
<p> Angel Food Cake – Are very light, since they are made using only egg whites. </p>
<p> How to make Cake / Pastry Flour </p>
<p> Making your own Cake flour is so easy, from every cup of flour remove two tablespoons of the flour and replace with corn starch, be sure to sift them together to remove any lumps. </p>
<p> How to store a Sponge Cake </p>
<p> A sponge cake will remain soft for about 2 days. To keep it soft be sure to wrap it in plastic wrap and store it at room temperature. </p>
<p> How to freeze a Sponge Cake </p>
<p> The baked cooled cake should be wrapped in plastic wrap and placed in an airtight container or freezer bag, it will keep in the freezer for up to one month. If you don’t have a big enough bag or container then wrap the cake in foil. </p>
<p> In order to thaw the cake, place the cake on a wire rack and leave it to thaw at room temperature. It should take a couple of hours to thaw. Once it has thawed it should be covered or it will start to dry out and go stale. </p>
<p> A Sponge Cake is exactly that, a sponge, perfect for soaking in any type of liquid. From coffee, to liqueur to even juice or milk. Or as the Italian likes to do, dunk it in his morning caffe latte. Enjoy! </p>

<p> Hi . I made Italian rainbow cookies to serve for Christmas. The recipe said to make them 2 weeks ahead to blend the flavors. I coated them in Chocolate and sliced them and stored them in a container. However they are very dry. As you know they are expensive and time consuming to make. I was wondering if I could salvage them by brushing them in a almond or amaretto simple syrup ? If that would work , would I brush both sides ? Also would I brush them now and continue to store them in a container at room temperature or brush them right before serving? Help! I don’t want to throw them out! If you could answer ASAP it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much! </p>
<p> Hi Terry, I hope I’m not too late, the hour difference makes it difficult. But yes I would brush them or even try quickly dipping one to make sure it doesn’t fall apart (you might have to thin the syrup maybe with some water). My husband always drizzled cake (any type) with some sort of liquid first before eating it. Hope that helps, let me know. </p>
<p> I have just made this and to my horror it was a complete flop. I followed the instructions to the letter and it looked great after it was cooked (30mins) but after I iced it I cut a piece and it was like foam rubber. I was so disappointed, 5 eggs and all. </p>
<p> Hi Donna, yes that’s why in the post I say that the cake is made for certain types of desserts, the layers should be soaked with some kind of liquid. Sorry it didn’t work out. </p>

<p> Pampered Chef’s heritage is written in stone—stoneware, that is. It’s been in our product line since the very beginning, so we know a thing or two about doing it right. Our stoneware is the best around: Many happy customers have had their favorite pieces for decades. Pampered Chef’s stoneware is a natural, everyday way to cook everything from quick dinners in the microwave to light, crispy desserts. Because this stoneware has super-tiny pores, it won’t absorb oils, odors, or flavors‚ so tonight’s chocolate chip cookies won’t taste like last night’s salmon dinner. Take a look at what the stoneware collection has to offer. </p>
<p> What Is Stoneware? </p>
<p> Stoneware is natural clay bakeware that’s great for everyday cooking. Because the clay is fired at very high temperatures, you get sturdy, durable cookware and bakeware that heats evenly and gives you consistent results every time you cook. Although all stone cookware is made in a similar way, it’s not all created equal. Pampered Chef stoneware is made from a natural clay that’s mined in the USA, and each piece is made in the USA, too. The clay is formed into one of our exclusive designs, fired at 2,000°F, then hand finished—so each piece is a one-of-a-kind creation. Shop the Collection </p>
<p> Choosing Your Stoneware </p>
<p> When you’re picking out the perfect piece of stoneware for your kitchen, there are a couple things to consider: what you cook and how much of it you make. If you’re cooking a small amount of food or reheating leftovers, small baking stone or personal pizza pan is the perfect size. There are plenty of stoneware bakers for family-sized meals, too. Just pick the right size for the meals your family loves to eat, and you’re ready to cook! Shop the Collection </p>
<p> Form & Function </p>
<p> All our stoneware, whether it’s glazed or unglazed, shares the same amazing cooking properties, so you’ll get outstanding results. If you want something super functional, go with unglazed stoneware. If you’d prefer something that goes effortlessly from the oven to your table, consider glazed stoneware. Our fully glazed stoneware goes from the oven to the table to the dishwasher, so entertaining has never been easier. Shop the Collection </p>
<p> How to Season Stoneware </p>
<p> One of the best things about stoneware is that it’s ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box—no preseasoning required! Just clean it and start cooking. As you cook, your stone will develop a natural nonstick seasoning. The darker your stone looks, the better it cooks. If you want to build the seasoning quickly, make high-fat foods like refrigerated biscuits or cookies the first few times you use the stone. Shop the Collection </p>
<p> How to Cook With Stoneware </p>
<p> Cooking with stoneware couldn’t be simpler. It’s just like using your metal sheet pans or glass casseroles. Use your stone in conventional and convection ovens, as well as your microwave or toaster oven. Unlike some other stoneware, you don’t have to preheat. Just put your food on the stone in an even layer, then cook or bake it as your recipe directs. You might need to add an extra minute or two for short bake times. Shop the Collection </p>
<p> How to Clean Stoneware </p>
<p> Cleaning stoneware is even easier than using it. All you need is a little hot water and a pan scraper—no soap required! Food particles, juices, and soap won’t soak into the stones since they’re virtually nonporous. Wait until your stone is completely cooled, then use the scraper to remove any food debris. You can deep clean it with a baking soda paste, so even cleanup is 100% natural. Shop the Collection </p>

<p> Couldn’t Be Easier: Delicious London broil + A Video </p>
<p> As parents, we hope to instill in our children the importance of traditions. Many of our family traditions revolve around food. For example, our Sunday evening tradition has become a London broil dinner. All my kids love this meal — which is quite a miracle — and I hope it might become a tradition in your home, too. Prepare to impress with this delicious, super quick and easy four ingredient London broil recipe. </p>
<p> ¼ cup soy sauce (if making GF use Kikkoman GF Soy Sauce) </p>
<p> ¼ cup honey </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Mix Italian dressing, honey and soy sauce in a large Ziploc bag. </p>
<p> Add London broil to bag and, if possible, let it marinate several hours in the refrigerator. </p>
<p> Grill on low heat 12 minutes each side (4 minute longer per side if you like it well done . . . but who likes it well done?!). </p>
<p> Tips and Tricks: </p>
<p> This is a great recipe to quickly throw together in the morning and let marinate in the refrigerator during the day. Just put the meat in the oven or grill it when you get home. </p>
<p> If you are living a cold climate and aren’t brave enough to grill in the winter (we Chicagoans grill in the snow), then preheat the oven to 375 degrees and bake the London broil on the lowest rack uncovered in a disposable pan for 45 min (+/- 15 minutes depending on preferred level of doneness) </p>
<p> As always with red meat, let it sit for 5-10 minutes after cooking before cutting to seal in the juice. </p>
<p> This London broil is great served with grilled asparagus and brown rice (my favorite is Trader Joe’s frozen brown rice) </p>
<p> Comments </p>
<p> After taking out several of your recipes I am going to have to try this and the Honey Dijon chicken. I love that your recipes are simple but they look so amazing. I am definitely going to share your page on mine so that hopefully will get even more views. </p>
<p> I have never tried to make london broil. You make it sound so easy. Maybe I’ll pick some up next time I’m at the grocery store. Thanks! </p>
<p> We had this the other night and it was sooo good. It’ll be made again, and often. Thanks so much and I’m so enjoying your sight. </p>
<p> Looks pretty simple and really delish! What temperature would you consider to be “low heat”? </p>
<p> If grilling I always keep my gages at “low”, the outside thermometer should read around 400. </p>
<p> Delicious flavor, but it ended up dry in the inside. Not sure what went wrong. It marinaded for more than a day. </p>
<p> Glad the taste was good, but sorry it way dry. How long did you cook it and at what temp? I would try it again, maybe try getting a london broil from a different butcher? Happy to answer any questions before you cook this next time. </p>
<p> Tried this with my family and everyone ate it, ALL of my kids! Mine was 2 pounds, so I cooked it for 45 minutes and it came out medium with ends medium-well. If you want it medium-rare, I would cook it for 35 minutes. </p>
<p> You’ll love how easy it is. It’s my favorite. I’ve not tried this one, but it sounds wonderful, too. I’ll try it, too. And, it isn’t far removed from what I do. </p>
<p> Made this tonight for dinner! First time I’ve ever tried London Broil. Turned out perfect. So easy to make. Thanks for such a great recipe! </p>
<p> Hi Tonya, This is one of my favorite recipes on the blog. I would not cook it in the crockpot as this is not a cut of meat that requires slow and long cooking time. It’s best in the oven or on the grill. Enjoy! Karen </p>

<p> Sushi </p>
<p> This article is about Japanese cuisine. For the ancient Chinese poet, see Su Shi. For other uses, see Sushi (disambiguation). </p>
<p> Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1] </p>
<p> Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.[2] </p>
<p> Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[3] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7] </p>
<p> Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi" </p>
<p> Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds. </p>
<p> It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9] </p>
<p> The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[10][11] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[12] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal Notes and Queries.[13] </p>
<p> The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.[14] </p>
<p> Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with zu instead of su when a prefix is attached, as in nigirizushi. </p>
<p> Chirashizushi (ちらし寿司, "scattered sushi", also referred to as barazushi) serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make.[citation needed] It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March. </p>
<p> Edomae chirashizushi (Edo-style scattered sushi) is served with uncooked ingredients in an artful arrangement. </p>
<p> Gomokuzushi (Kansai-style sushi) consists of cooked or uncooked ingredients mixed in the body of rice. </p>
<p> Sake-zushi (Kyushu-style sushi) uses rice wine over vinegar in preparing the rice, and is topped with shrimp, sea bream, octopus, shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots and shredded omelette. </p>
<p> Inarizushi (稲荷寿司) is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone. Tales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god Inari. Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.[15] </p>
<p> Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (帛紗寿司, fukusa-zushi, or 茶巾寿司, chakin-zushi) instead of tofu. It should not be confused with inari maki, which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu. In Korean, inarizushi called yubuchobap (유부초밥). </p>
<p> Cone sushi is a variant of inarizushi originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular abura-age piece. It is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.[16][17][18][19] </p>
<p> Makizushi (巻き寿司, "rolled sushi"), norimaki (海苔巻き, "Nori roll") or makimono (巻物, "variety of rolls") is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a makisu (巻き簾). Makizushi is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. Makizushi is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of makizushi, but many other kinds exist. </p>
<p> Futomaki (太巻, "thick, large or fat rolls") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with nori on the outside.[20] A typical futomaki is five to six centimetres (2 to 2 1⁄2 in) in diameter.[21] They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called ehō-maki (恵方巻, lit. happy direction rolls).[22] By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan.[23] Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, kampyō gourd, takenoko bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of tamagoyaki omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and oboro (food) whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings.[20] Traditionally, the vinegared rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sugar. Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, eggs, tunas, or shrimps. Vegetables usually include cucumbers, lettuces, and takuan (沢庵) (pickled radish). As a side note, the rice in Korean style Gimbap is none vinegar, and lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil/perilla oil, and popular ingredients are carrots, spinaches, beef, kimchi, takuan. </p>
<p> Short grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice. Nowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice and cereals etc. Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating. Tamago makizushi (玉子巻き寿司) is makizushi is rolled out by a thin egg. Tempura Makizushi (天ぷら 巻き寿司) or Agezushi (揚げ寿司ロール) is a fried version of the dish. </p>
<p> Hosomaki (細巻, "thin rolls") is a small cylindrical piece, with nori on the outside. A typical hosomaki has a diameter of about 2.5 centimetres (1 in).[21] They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, kanpyō, nattō, umeboshi paste, squid with shiso (Japanese herb). Kappamaki, (河童巻) a kind of Hosomaki filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, kappamaki is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods. </p>
<p> Tekkamaki (鉄火巻) is a kind of hosomaki filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word tekka, meaning "red hot iron", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called tekkaba (鉄火場), much like the sandwich.[24][25] Negitoromaki (ねぎとろ巻) is a kind of hosomaki filled with scallion (negi) and chopped tuna (toro). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. Tsunamayomaki (ツナマヨ巻) is a kind of hosomaki filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise. </p>
<p> Ehōmaki (恵方巻, "lucky direction roll") is a roll composed of seven ingredients considered to be lucky. Ehōmaki are often eaten on setsubun in Japan. The typical ingredients include kanpyō, egg, eel, and shiitake mushrooms. Ehōmaki often include other ingredients too. People usually eat the ehōmaki while facing the direction considered to be auspicious that year.[26] </p>
<p> Temaki (手巻, "hand roll") is a large cone-shaped piece of nori on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical temaki is about 10 centimetres (4 in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, temaki must be eaten quickly after being made because the nori cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the nori in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.[27] </p>
<p> Narezushi (熟れ寿司, "matured sushi") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this sushi can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more.[28] </p>
<p> Several types of nigirizushi, rice hand-pressed with various seafood, including tuna, eel, and sea urchin roe gunkanmaki </p>
<p> Nigirizushi (握り寿司, "hand-pressed sushi") consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a topping (the neta) draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of wasabi; neta are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus (tako), freshwater eel (unagi), sea eel (anago), squid (ika), and sweet egg (tamago). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.[original research?] </p>
<p> Gunkanmaki (軍艦巻, "warship roll") is a special type of nigirizushi: an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of nori wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of nori such as roe, nattō, oysters, uni (sea urchin roe), corn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. Gunkan-maki was invented at the Ginza Kyubey restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.[31][32] </p>
<p> Temarizushi (手まり寿司, "ball sushi") is a sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap. </p>
<p> Japanese cutlassfish oshizushi at a restaurant in Minamata City, Kumamoto Prefecture </p>
<p> Oshizushi (押し寿司, "pressed sushi"), also known as hako-zushi (箱寿司, "box sushi"), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an oshibako. The chef lines the bottom of the oshibako with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is バッテラ (battera, pressed mackerel sushi) or 鯖寿司 (saba zushi).[33] In oshizushi, all the ingredients are either cooked or cured and raw fish is never used.[34] </p>
<p> Norway roll (ノルウェー巻き). A Norwegian businessman introduced the use of salmon as a sushi ingredient to Japan in the 1980s.[35] </p>
<p> The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry in the 1980s.[36][37][35] Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a norimaki with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) has evolved since. Norway roll is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.[38] </p>
<p> Uramaki (裏巻, "inside-out roll") is a medium-sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings, and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. Uramaki differs from other makimono because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside. The filling is in the center surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots. </p>
<p> Examples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the "rock and roll" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside). </p>
<p> In Japan, uramaki is an uncommon type of makimono; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.[39] </p>
<p> Rainbow roll, uramaki with multiple fillings including shrimp tempura, salmon, avocado, mango, with rice mixed with tobiko </p>
<p> Futomaki is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take their names from their places of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the tempura roll, where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well. </p>
<p> Per Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to serving in order to kill parasites.[40] Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared to Japan, raw seafood (e.g., sashimi) is not as prevalent a component in American-style sushi. </p>
<p> Since rolls are often made to-order it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g. salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, tuna roll, shrimp or tuna tempura roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include: </p>
<p> Sushi roll name </p>
<p> Definition </p>
<p> Alaskan roll </p>
<p> a variant of the California roll with raw salmon on the inside, or layered on the outside.[41] </p>
<p> contains grilled or barbecued salmon skin, cucumber, sweet sauce, sometimes with roe. Also sometimes referred to as salmon skin rolls outside of British Columbia, Canada.[43] </p>
<p> consists of avocado, kani kama (imitation crab/crab stick) (also can contain real crab in "premium" varieties), cucumber, and tobiko, often made as uramaki (with rice on the outside, nori on the inside)[44] </p>
<p> includes yellowtail (hamachi) or prawn tempura, and fillings such as bean sprouts, carrots, avocado, cucumber, chili, spicy mayonnaise, and roe.[45] </p>
<p> Hawaiian roll </p>
<p> contains shoyu tuna (canned), tamago, kanpyō, kamaboko, and the distinctive red and green hana ebi (shrimp powder).[46] </p>
<p> Mango roll </p>
<p> includes fillings such as avocado, crab meat, tempura shrimp, mango slices, and topped off with a creamy mango paste.[47] </p>
<p> Michigan roll </p>
<p> includes fillings such as spicy tuna, smelt roe, spicy sauce, avocado, and sushi rice. Is a variation on spicy tuna roll.[48] </p>
<p> New Mexico roll </p>
<p> originating in New Mexico; includes New Mexico green chile (sometimes tempura fried), teriyaki sauce, and rice.[49][50] Sometimes simply referred to as a "green chile (tempura) roll" within the state.[51][52] </p>
<p> is a California roll uramaki with multiple types of fish (commonly yellowtail, tuna, salmon, snapper, white fish, eel, etc.) and avocado wrapped around it.[54] </p>
<p> includes fried soft-shell crab and other fillings such as cucumber, avocado, daikon sprouts or lettuce, roe, and sometimes spicy mayonnaise.[56] </p>
<p> a large, customizable roll offered in a number of "sushi burrito" restaurants in the United States.[57] </p>
<p> All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients. </p>
<p> Sushi-meshi 鮨飯 (also known as Su-meshi 酢飯, shari 舎利, or gohan ご飯) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji). </p>
<p> Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used. </p>
<p> There are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar. </p>
<p> The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori (海苔). Nori is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper.[58] Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets. </p>
<p> The size of a nori sheet influences the size of makimono. A full-size sheet produces futomaki, and a half produces hosomaki and temaki. To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately-sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet. </p>
<p> Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi. </p>
<p> When making fukusazushi, a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan, known as a makiyakinabe, and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.[59] </p>
<p> Sushi made of meats other than fish (whether raw or cooked) is a variation often seen in Japan. </p>
<p> Yaki anago-ippon-nigiri (焼きアナゴ一本握り) – a roasted and sweet-sauced whole conger </p>
<p> Ebifurai-maki (エビフライ巻き) – fried-shrimp roll </p>
<p> Date-Maki (伊達巻) – futomaki wrapped with sweet tamagoyaki </p>
<p> The ingredients used inside sushi are called gu, and are, typically, varieties of fish.[60] For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish.[61] This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning "middle toro", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw toppings, called neta.[60] </p>
<p> Other seafoods such as squid (ika), eel (anago and unagi), pike conger (hamo), octopus (tako), shrimp (ebi and amaebi), clam (mirugai, aoyagi and akagai), fish roe (ikura, masago, kazunoko and tobiko), sea urchin (uni), crab (kani), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. Kani kama, or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.[62] </p>
<p> Tofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called tamagoyaki and raw quail eggs ride as a gunkan-maki topping) are common. </p>
<p> Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts. </p>
<p> True wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning.[64] The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten-zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled "Japanese Horseradish".[65] </p>
<p> Gari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as agari. </p>
<p> Sushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad. </p>
<p> When closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called baran or kiri-zasa (切り笹). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the Aspidistra elatior (葉蘭 haran) and Sasa veitchii (熊笹 kuma-zasa) plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi.[66] Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.[67] </p>
<p> The main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are gari and nori. Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits.[68] The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial properties, especially on cardiovascular health, natural anti-inflammatory compounds, and play a role in brain function.[69] </p>
<p> Generally sushi is not a particularly fattening food. However, rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content.[70] Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content, especially contributed from shoyu soy sauce seasoning.[69] </p>
<p> Some of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity[71] or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children.[72] </p>
<p> According to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish.[73] This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus.[73] Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more.[73] The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover, are also a concern as well.[73] </p>
<p> Sashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites: </p>
<p> For the above reasons, EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below −20 °C (−4 °F) in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours.[77] As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users "super-freeze" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 °C.[78] As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.[79] </p>
<p> Some forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan.[80] The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass.[81] </p>
<p> Sustainable sushi is sushi made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired. Concerns over the sustainability of sushi ingredients arise from greater concerns over environmental, economic and social stability and human health. </p>
<p> Sushi served on a wooden platter at a sushi restaurant in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. </p>
<p> Traditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.[citation needed] </p>
<p> Many sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as shō-chiku-bai (松竹梅), shō/matsu (松, pine), chiku/take (竹, bamboo) and bai/ume (梅, plum), with matsu the most expensive and ume the cheapest.[citation needed] Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept. </p>
<p> Meat sushi </p>
<p> Sushi may be served kaiten zushi (sushi train) style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.[82] </p>
<p> Some specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars. </p>
<p> Agari: "Rise up" Green tea. Ocha (お茶) in usual Japanese. </p>
<p> Gari: Sweet, pickled and sliced ginger, or sushi ginger. Shōga (生姜) in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Gyoku: "Jewel". Sweet and cubic-shaped omelette. Tamagoyaki (卵焼, 玉子焼) in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Murasaki: "Violet" or "purple" (color). Soy sauce. Shōyu (醤油) in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Neta: Toppings on nigiri or fillings in makimono. Ne-ta is from reversal of ta-ne. Tane (種) in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Oaiso: "Compliment". Bill or check. Oaiso may be used in not only sushi bars but also izakaya.[83][84] Okanjō or chekku (お勘定 or チェック) in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Otemoto: Chopsticks. Otemoto means the nearest thing from the customer seated. Hashi (箸) or ohashi in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Shari: Vinegar rice or rice. It may originally be from Sanskrit (zaali शालि) meaning rice or Śarīra. Gohan (ご飯) or meshi (飯) in standard Japanese. </p>
<p> Tsume: Sweet thick sauce mainly made of soy sauce. Nitsume (煮詰め) in standard Japanese.[85] </p>
<p> Unlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, nigirizushi is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings.[86] Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a bento, a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal. </p>
<p> Soy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart.[87] If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using gari (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce. </p>
<p> Traditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of wasabi to use. However, today wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.[88] </p>

<p> Ten commandments of Italian cooking </p>
<p> Britain’s doyenne of Italian cookery simplifies the cuisine into 10 commandments, prizing good ingredients, subtlety, and giving taste god-like status </p>
<p> When I was asked to write The 10 Commandments For Making Good Italian Food, I felt God had an easier job to do. What, indeed, are they? And how to define them? Are they so important as to be termed “commandments”? After thinking – and munching – it over for a few days, I decided on the following 10 rules for cooking food all’Italiana. You will not, however, go to hell if you do not follow them, nor to heaven if you do – though the result of your efforts may send you there, granted. Here they are: not on two tablets, but just a piece of newspaper: </p>
<p> 1 Buy the best ingredients </p>
<p> Italian food is relatively simple; its success is based mainly on the flavour of the key ingredient, so this must be the highest quality. The Italians spend far more on food than the British, in spite of having a smaller income. According to a 2008 Washington State University survey, the Italians spend $5,200 (£3,600) per person per year on food, while the British spend $3,700 (£2,600) – lower than the Germans, French, Spaniards and most other Europeans. To emulate an Italian in the kitchen, you need to prioritise flavour. </p>
<p> 2 Use the right pan </p>
<p> What difference could a pan make to the final result? Well, a risotto made in a paella pan would never have the soft gluey quality of a good risotto. A saute pan, because of its depth and curved sides, is better for braising meat or vegetables than a frying pan. Pasta should be cooked in a cylindrical pot so the water returns to the boil more quickly once you have added the pasta, preventing the shapes from sticking together. Ragu, stews and pulses are cooked in pots made of earthenware, the best material for slow cooking, because it distributes the heat evenly. </p>
<p> 3 Season during cooking </p>
<p> Pepper is not used a lot in traditional Italian cooking, but, when it is, it’s usually added during – not after – cooking. Salt, always sea salt, is added as a dish cooks, usually at the beginning, so it dissolves properly, which means less call for serving salt. </p>
<p> 4 Use herbs and spices subtly </p>
<p> Both are added to enhance the flavour of the main ingredient, not to distract from it. Pellegrino Artusi, one of the great cookery writers, wrote that flavourings should not be detected; they should only be a gentle foil. Chilli, nowadays the most popular, was once used only used in Calabria and the province of Siena. It is added in moderation mainly to shellfish and some tomato sauces. Nutmeg is often added to mashed potatoes and meatballs; cinnamon to braised meat, custard and cakes, and cloves always go into stock, chickpeas and game. Flat-leaf parsley, rosemary, sage and basil are invariably used fresh, but oregano is always used dried. </p>
<p> 5 Make a good battuto </p>
<p> A battuto is a mixture of very finely chopped ingredients, and varies according to their use. The most common battuto is onion, carrot and celery, which is the basis of the soffritto (see Commandment 6), but there are battuti of other ingredients, too. Some battuti are used a crudo, which means that they are added to the main dish without being cooked before. The most common of these is that of parsley, garlic, capers or olives and a touch of chilli; it is used for dressing cooked vegetables, such as cauliflower, on boiled fish or with boiled meat, tongue or ham. Traditionally, onion and garlic are never present in the same battuto. </p>
<p> 6 Keep an eye on your soffritto </p>
<p> A soffritto is a cooked battuto, mostly a mixture of pancetta or lardo and vegetables. It is a vital part of many Italian dishes. A soffritto must be watched and stirred with care while it is cooking. Two minutes longer watching the telly and your soffritto becomes a burnt mess. I always add a pinch of salt when I saute the onion (usually the first ingredient to go into the pan), because the salt releases the liquid in the onion, thus preventing it from burning. </p>
<p> 7 Use the right amount of sauce </p>
<p> The Italians like to eat pasta dressed with sauce – not sauce dressed with pasta. The usual amount of sauce added to a portion of pasta is two full tablespoons, so the amount of ragu necessary for dressing about 500g of pasta is made with 400g of meat, plus the pancetta, all the vegetables for the soffritto and the tomatoes. A tomato sauce for 400-500g of spaghetti is made with 1kg of fresh tomatoes or with two tins of plum tomatoes. </p>
<p> 8 Taste while you cook </p>
<p> Food in Italy is mostly cooked directly on the heat and not in the oven – which might be why the Italians are not strong on baking. The food in the pot is nurtured all through the cooking: a spoonful of water or wine may be added, a pinch of salt, a grinding of pepper, a touch more of chilli, a teaspoon of sugar, a drop or two of lemon juice or vinegar may all go in the pot. The cook is perpetually tasting and adjusting. The final result is a labour of patience and love. </p>
<p> 9 Serve pasta and risotto alone </p>
<p> I shall always remember a lunch at our house when my husband, a very reserved English man, categorically responded to one of my cookery colleagues who asked for the salad with her penne: “No, I am sorry, you are in an Italian home and you can’t have salad with pasta.” That’s it. Neither pasta nor risotto are ever served with salad, vegetables, meat or fish or anything. Only one pasta dish and two risotti are traditionally accompanied by meat: Carne alla Genovese – a braised beef dish allegedly brought to Naples by the Genovese merchants, served with penne; Ossobuco alla Milanese – the traditional ossobuco without tomatoes served with saffron risotto; and Costolette del Priore – breaded veal chops in a cheese sauce, served with risotto in bianco (plain risotto). </p>
<p> 10 Don’t overdo the parmesan </p>
<p> There may be a bowl of grated parmigiano reggiano on the table when pasta or risotto are served, but the usual amount added is not more than 1-2 teaspoons, so as not to overpower the flavour of the main dish. It should be grated, not flaked; except on special salads, such as those with fennel or artichoke. The cheese must dissolve, imparting an overall flavour like a seasoning. Parmesan is not added to fish or seafood risotto, apart from some varieties with prawns. </p>

<p> The 8 cutting techniques every chef should learn </p>
<p> by Shoes For Crews Europe </p>
<p> Published March 3, 2020 </p>
<p> Learning the ways of a chef's knife is perhaps one of the finest arts every chef has to master. Your knife skills can make you stand out from the newbies and prove you're on the path to becoming a head chef. </p>
<p> Along with knowing the recipes, cooking techniques and what chefs should wear for work, every chef is expected to learn and master the many different cutting techniques. From the Julienne to the Batonnet, there is a lot of pressure for chefs to learn the cuts, chops, slices and dices. We've collected the most important techniques chefs need to learn to excel in their job and improve their skills. </p>
<p> Do you want to show off your skills? Here are the cutting techniques every chef should know: </p>
<p> Cross Chop </p>
<p> The Cross Chop is regularly used if you need to quickly chop, without having to worry about presentation. Small vegetables or herbs are the best ingredients to use when cross chopping. </p>
<p> Holding the handle of the knife with one hand, put the palm of your hand on top of the blade (this helps you guide and control the chopping pace). Keep the tip of the blade down whilst you lift the handle of the blade to chop. As your hands are out of the way, they're safe. </p>
<p> Rock Chop </p>
<p> Similar to the cross chop, hold the handle of the blade and keep the tip of the knife down on the board. But with the rock chop, you use your other hand to move the ingredient. As you chop, you will be keeping the blade still whilst you push the vegetable forward. </p>
<p> Remember to curl your fingers to keep them safe from the blade. </p>
<p> Julienne Cut </p>
<p> The Julienne Cut is a very fine cut where the thickness of each slice is between 1-2mm. Very fine indeed! After cutting the vegetables into thin rectangular cuts, the fine slice technique is used again to create thin match stick shapes. </p>
<p> Also known as Julienning, this cut is regularly used for carrots, celery or you can create Julienne Fries from potatoes. After mastering Julienning you can prepare your ingredients finely and neatly. </p>
<p> The Julienne is one of the most important cutting techniques every chef should know as it's popularly used and it's the initial step for other types of cuts. </p>
<p> Brunoise Dice </p>
<p> The Brunoise technique is an additional step after you have completed Julienning your ingredients. Once your ingredients have been julienned, you then dice again to create small cubes. </p>
<p> Ideally the cube size should be 2mm x 2mm x 2mm. The Brunoise Dice is the smallest dicing cut and is popularly used for soups. If you have mastered the Julienne, you can master the Brunoise! </p>
<p> Small Dice </p>
<p> The name of this cut is slightly deceiving as it's a slighter larger cut than the Brunoise Dice. At 3mm x 3mm x 3mm, the Small Dice technique begins by Julienning the ingredients and then dicing into slightly bigger cubes than the Brunoise. Although there is only a minor difference between the Small and the Brunoise, it's important to get them right. Just always remember the Brunoise is the 'smaller' cut. </p>
<p> The Batonnet </p>
<p> The clue is in the name. The Batonnet technique is used to cut baton shape vegetables (for example, like chips). Think of the Batonnet as a chucky chip type of cut. </p>
<p> The dimensions you should be heading for is 6mm x 6mm x 6mm. It's important to stick to this size and then your cuts will have continuity and look professional. </p>
<p> The Baton </p>
<p> Just because they like to be confusing. Whilst Batonnets create cuboid shape ingredients, the Baton is used to create large dices. Cut at 12mm x 12mm x 6cm, the Baton is not regularly used but it's a good technique to have up your sleeve. </p>
<p> Pont-Neuf </p>
<p> The Pont-Neuf is only related to cutting potatoes. After the potatoes have been skinned and washed, cut your potatoes to 2cm x 7cm to create chunky chip shapes. </p>
<p> Every chef should learn and become experts of these cutting techniques. If you're a new chef, you only need to practice to be able to become a professional chef. </p>
<p> How are your work shoes? </p>
<p> It's important that chefs have the correct footwear for work. Slip-resistant chef shoes are designed to greatly reduce the chance of you suffering a slip or fall at work. </p>

<p> The Very Important Italian Cold-Cut Sandwich Rules </p>
<p> There are certain universal truths when it comes to making an Italian cold-cuts sandwich. </p>
<p> A hero, a hoagie, a grinder, a sub. You can call it what you want. But there are certain universal truths when it comes to making an Italian cold-cuts sandwich. The first rule: Yes, you can prepare one at home that's as delicious as the one you buy from your favorite sandwich shop. </p>
<p> You just need to break down the components and appreciate the overall architecture. Because, really, you're not making a sandwich, you're building one. </p>
<p> The bread: A basic sub roll, the kind in those plastic bins at your supermarket. Cottony on the inside, a little crackly on the outside. </p>
<p> The meat: This is crucial. Find a good market with a wide selection of cured Italian meats. Ask the guy at the counter to slice them really thin—you want airy ribbons or porky goodness. Texture is everything; you don't want a dense sandwich. I like buying three or four meats: something cured and aged like a soppressata; mortadella, the rich, smooth progenitor of what we call bologna; a cooked ham, such as Parma cotto; and then, if you like heat, get a spicy coppa. </p>
<p> The cheese: Provolone. That's it. Sliced thin, like the cold cuts. Lettuce: You want a lettuce with crunch. So go with iceberg, shredded. Save the arugula and the fancy farmers' market greens for your next dinner party. </p>
<p> Onion: At BA, we like to slice them, you guessed it, real thin. Then we soak the slices in ice water to temper their raw bite. </p>
<p> Tomato: If they're in season, go for it. </p>
<p> Condiments: I love mayonnaise; I realize everyone does not. Your call. What you do want is some sort of pickled vegetable spread. I either reach for bottled giardiniera, or if I want some heat, I'm big on Calabrian chile spread, which you can find online or an Italian market. Dressing: The essential, finishing touch that makes an Italian hero taste like the Italian heroes of your youth. Once all of the elements are stacked up (in order: meat, cheese, lettuce, onion), douse it with olive oil and red wine vinegar and then, the key move, a few pinches of dried oregano. </p>
<p> And there you go. You've just built yourself an authentic Italian hero. Or hoagie. Or grinder. Or sub. </p>

<p> Here's a batch of wonderful cookie recipes to make and give over the holiday season. In this collection we're sticking with the seasonal, the classic, and the beloved. There's nothing flashy here, and you'll find nothing trendy in this gallery, either. Most of these recipes speak of tradition, like the spritz cookie shown here that's dressed up with a marbled red-and-white glaze, evoking the classic holiday candy cane. It's a recipe definitely worth dusting off your cookie press for. Then there is the soft and cakey German Lebkuchen with their pretty wrapping; the crisp, classic gingerbread cut-outs; or the Finnish pinwheel cookie called Joulutorttu. We have included some of Martha's own old-world favorites as well as her mother, Mrs. Kostyra's recipe for the feather-light Polish fried pastry leaves called Chrusciki. </p>
<p> Between the crunchy spice cookie, Speculaas, the black pepper gingerbread Pfefernussen, and the Chewy Chocolate Gingerbread Cookies, all the warming spices are covered. When it comes to fruit and nuts, there are biscotti studded with jewel-like cranberries and pistachios. If those treats aren't your favorites, consider whipping up a batch of our thumbprint cookies with brightly colored centers, delicious, buttery shortbreads, or something a little unexpected, like Chocolate Espresso Snowcaps. And if you haven't gotten your seasonal fix of eggnog just yet, then you'll be pleased to know that we're also sharing a cookie version of the classic drink you're guaranteed to love. </p>
<p> When we look toward the winter holidays, we think of ways to bring cheer to the ones we love. Picking any one of these time-honored favorite cookie recipes for your gift-giving, sharing, and festive occasions is the best way to start. Happy baking! </p>

Just pick and choose among these menu options and enjoy a classic holiday dinner this year. </p>

You can easily multiply the recipe to serve a big crowd. </p>
<p> Christmas and cranberries go together like Santa and presents. Here's a decadent holiday appetizer that would make an ideal starter or appetizer at Christmas dinner.

<p> An impassioned Italian Scot sharing how to cook authentically, and travel with enthusiasm. </p>
<p> Traditional Italian Dove Bread for Easter (Colomba di Pasqua) </p>
<p> This traditional Italian dove bread for Easter is made in many homes and sold before Easter in Italy and around the world. In Italy, Colomba di Pasqua literally translates to “Easter Dove”. </p>
<p> Columba di Pasqua, or Italian dove bread, is basically a panettone, but shaped into a dove-like form. (I honestly have questioned the shape, but I suppose it’s difficult to make a bread look like a delicate bird.) </p>
<p> This post may contain Amazon affiliate links for your convenience, at no additional cost to you. </p>
<p> Let’s just say you have to use your imagination and it’s more of a symbol for peace and the Holy Spirit on Easter, than anything else. </p>
<p> This brings us to the part where I discuss how to make this shape. You honestly don’t have to use a paper case or mold, but as I commented above, even Italian dove bread that is professionally made don’t look like a dove to me. At first, I couldn’t find the baking mold, then when I found it–it was too expensive, so I decided to make my own. I’m happy with the result, since we’re just going to eat it anyway. Right? </p>
<p> Whether you make the dove bread with or without a mold, the end result will still be delicious. If by chance, you don’t finish it before it starts to get stale, it makes the best bread and butter pudding! </p>
<p> If you like using yeast, please give my PERFECT YEAST DOUGHNUT recipe a try! It’s incredibly good! </p>
<p> Without further ado, I present to you the recipe for~ </p>
<p> Traditional Italian Dove Bread for Easter (Colomba di Pasqua) </p>
<p> 1 tsp each of lemon and orange rind (preferably from organic fruit) </p>
<p> ½ tsp salt </p>
<p> ½ c (4 oz) good quality unsalted butter, softened and cut into pieces </p>
<p> 3¼ cups (1 lb) organic, unbleached flour </p>
<p> 1 pkg dry yeast (preferably for bread machines, but any type will work-I used regular) </p>
<p> Place the water, egg yolks, vanilla, and grated peel into the bread machine first. Next add the sugar, salt, flour and pieces of butter around the outside of the metal pan on top of the flour (see photo below). Make an indentation in the flour and add the yeast. Start the bread machine on “dough” setting. </p>
<p> Keep an eye on the dough after it’s finished and allow to rise until doubled in size. </p>
<p> To make the mold. Cut pieces of aluminum foil and fold them over and over to make a long strip (see my photo below). Join them together with metal paper clips and shape into a “dove” shape. I didn’t have heavy duty aluminum foil, but this type would be best as it holds it’s shape better. (Alternatively, buy the paper case.) </p>
<p> Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead into a ball then cut 1/3 of the dough off and shape into a log. Shape the larger piece into a larger log which will be the main part of the Italian dove bread. </p>
<p> The larger piece will go lengthwise into the mold and be the body of the dove, while the smaller piece will go across the top and become the wings. Place the dove shaped dough into the oven (with the oven off) and allow to rise until at least doubled (probably 2 to 3 hours). </p>
<p> When the bread has finished rising, remove it from the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C. </p>
<p> Beat the egg white, corn starch, almond meal, and regular sugar with a fork in a small bowl until well combined. I used almond meal which has the peel in it and it still looks fine when baked. </p>
<p> Brush this over the top of the dove bread. </p>
<p> Next, scatter the Belgian and/or Swedish pearl sugar over the top, and dot with whole almonds. </p>
<p> Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 325°F/160°C and continue to bake until a long, thin skewer comes out clean (about another half an hour). If the top browns too quickly, cover with aluminum foil. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the tray for about 15 minutes. </p>
<p> As you can see, my “dove” doesn’t look too dove-like! I honestly don’t mind, but if you do, buy those paper baking cases. </p>
<p> Remove the aluminum foil after the bread has cooled. This bread will keep for a week or so, and remember that it’s great for making those bread puddings I told you about, as well as French toast, if it gets a wee bit stale. Enjoy your own homemade Italian dove bread! </p>

<p> Traditional Italian Dove Bread for Easter (Colomba di Pasqua) </p>
<p> Print </p>
<p> A traditional Italian Easter bread made in the shape of a dove. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 1 tsp each of lemon and orange rind (preferably from organic fruit) </p>
<p> ½ tsp salt </p>
<p> ½ c (4 oz) good quality unsalted butter, softened and cut into pieces </p>
<p> 3¼ cups (1 lb) organic, unbleached flour (bread flour is best, but all purpose or plain works too) </p>
<p> 1 pkg dry yeast (preferably for bread machines, but any type will work-I used regular) </p>
<p> Topping </p>
<p> 1/4 cup (ground almonds) </p>
<p> 1/3 cup sugar </p>
<p> Instructions </p>
<p> Place the water, egg yolks, vanilla, and grated peel into the bread machine first. Next add the sugar, salt, flour and pieces of butter around the outside of the metal pan on top of the flour (see photo below). Make an indentation in the flour and add the yeast. Start the bread machine on “dough” setting. </p>
<p> When the machine beeps to add additional ingredients to the dough, toss in the sultanas and raisins, and allow the cycle to finish. Keep an eye on the dough after it’s finished and allow to rise until doubled in size. </p>
<p> To make the mold. Cut pieces of aluminum foil and fold them over and over to make a long strip (see photo in post). Join them together with metal paper clips and shape into a "dove" shape. I didn't have heavy duty aluminum foil, but this type would be best as it holds it's shape better. </p>
<p> Once the dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead into a ball then cut 1/3 of the dough off and shape into a log. Shape the larger piece into a larger log. </p>
<p> The larger piece will go lengthwise into the mold and be the body of the dove, while the smaller piece will go across the top and become the wings. Place the dove shaped dough into the oven (with the oven off) and allow to rise until at least doubled (probably 2 to 3 hours). </p>
<p> When the bread has finished rising, remove it from the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C. </p>
<p> Beat the egg white, corn starch, almond meal, and regular sugar with a fork in a small bowl until well combined. I used almond meal which has the peel in it and it still looks fine when baked. Brush this over the top of the dove bread. </p>
<p> Next, scatter the Belgian and/or Swedish pearl sugar over the top, and dot with whole almonds. </p>
<p> Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 325°F/160°C and continue to bake until a long, thin skewer comes out clean (about another half an hour). If the top browns too quickly, cover with aluminum foil. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the tray for about 15 minutes. </p>
<p> Remove the aluminum foil after the bread has cooled. This bread will keep for a week or so, and remember that it's great for making those bread puddings I told you about, if it gets a wee bit stale. </p>

<p> Hi Christine, either with a stand mixer or by hand, you can add the yeast to the water and let it start to activate while you prepare the other ingredients. Put the flour, sugar and salt in a bow, stir the ingredients and make a well in the center. Add the liquids, softened butter, egg yolks, vanilla and citrus rind and start making a dough. Once a dough has formed, put it onto a well floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes or until the dough is very soft and pliable. Cover and let rise and follow the rest of the directions once it’s doubled in size. :) CC </p>
<p> […] Colomba di Pasqua (literally “Easter dove”) is a panettone-like bread that is shaped in the form of a dove. […] </p>
<p> Hi thank you for posting this lovely recipe of the “Colomba” it’s our tradition Easter Sweet Bread since I’m visiting my son this year in London I brought back a paper pan and going to try this one for Easter this year, bringing back some memories when they were little living in Italy! </p>
<p> Oh you are so welcome, Alma! That’s a lovely thing to do, and I’m sure everyone will love it! I always look forward to the Italian Easter bread, too! The one with eggs and icing (I have that recipe too, if you’d like it)! Enjoy! (Btw, sorry for the delayed response, for some reason your comment was in my spam. No idea why!) </p>
<p> Do you have a recipe for Easter BREAD stuffed with ground ham and ricotta cheese? </p>
<p> Great Recipe! I made mine in a round panettone pan. I did not have time to make a dove shape. Made one 7″ round and 7 cupcakes size. It tuned out great. Rose very high in both sizes in a controlled heated proofing area. I had to lower the temperature to 325.300 F to prevent it darkening too much. Thank you for letting me make a successful product. </p>
<p> That’s great to hear, Jonee! Happy that the cupcake sized ones turned out, too! Grazie! </p>
<p> This looks absolutely delicious. BUT I missed this over Easter. Is it bad luck or something to make it after Easter? Am making a note of this one for next year too! </p>
<p> Haha! It’s just a dove shaped (or in my case, the dove flew into a wall) panettone! Make away! :) </p>
<p> Hi Christina, This looks great! I am anxious to try it. I wonder if you or anyone has a recipe for a BREAD stuffed with ground ham and ricotta that is Italian supposedly. </p>
<p> Thanks Janice! I honestly don’t know a recipe for this bread. Have you looked on google? </p>
<p> Lovely colomba di Pasqua, Christina! Some year I will make this – this year we are traveling for a family wedding, and Easter itself will be spent in the air! Happy Easter! </p>
<p> Oh, that is a new way to do the colomba. And I love the idea of the mold!This morning I just did a fast version I found (in Italian) and transformed it into gluten-/sugar free. But I have a recipe that worked well on my blog already. Easter without the colomba is no Easter for me. Happy Easter Christina! </p>
<p> This looks great! Will have to pull out the bread machine and try it. Leftover panettone makes awesome French toast as well! This bread would also be great as French toast. Thanks for posting it. </p>
<p> It’s so easy in the bread machine and it is perfect for French toast as well, I’ll have to add that to my post! Thanks for the reminder and Happy Easter to you! </p>
<p> Looks lovely! You know how much I love anything with almonds! Pinned/stumbled and yummed. Happy Easter! </p>

<p> Italy's best traditional pasta dishes </p>
<p> Luciana Squadrilli introduces the thirteen most traditional and delicious pasta dishes found throughout Italy, including some well known classics and a few hardly heard of outside the country. </p>

<p> When it comes to pasta, Italy is unrivalled beyond doubt. As the world's biggest producers and consumers – approximately twenty-five kilos per person every year, unexpectedly followed by Tunisians – Italians are probably the only people happy to eat pasta more than once every day. </p>
<p> Always considered (and cooked) as a course on its own and not as a basic carbohydrate to accompany meals as a side dish, pasta – served after entrées and before meat or fish courses – is yet another delicious example of typical Italian inventiveness. With over 300 different shapes (formati) – from the most common ones such as spaghetti and rigatoni, to the oddly-named regional varieties of freshly made pasta – and a virtually endless number of possible combinations of ingredients to create both simple or elaborate sauces, there’s never a dull dish. </p>
<p> Here’s a quick overview of Italy's most popular traditional pasta dishes which have stood the test of time, plus our top pasta recipes so you can cook them at home. </p>
<p> This is a classic ‘empty larder’ recipe, but by using a generous amount of great quality extra virgin olive oil, you can achieve a highly satisfying result. Let the garlic gently turn golden brown simmering in a pan with the oil, add the desired amount of chilli and season the cooked and drained spaghetti with the flavoured oil, removing the garlic. Once on the plate, you can add a sprinkle of parsley. </p>
<p> Spaghetti al pomodoro </p>
<p> If you ask an Italian chef which single recipe is best at evaluating a cook's skills, they will tell you spaghetti al pomodoro. The secret is using fresh and tasty sun-ripened tomatoes without overcooking them, or very good quality tinned peeled tomatoes, a little bit of garlic and fresh basil leaves to give scent during cooking. Put a fresh basil leaf on the top of the finished dish for an additional Mediterranean touch. </p>
<p> Fettuccine al pomodoro </p>
<p> This is northern Italy's response to spaghetti al pomodoro; the typical, not-too-thin egg pasta is seasoned with a rich, slowly-cooked tomato sauce (with or without meat; in the former case you would call it a ‘quick ragù’) and flavoured with a generous amount of freshly grated Parmesan or Grana Padano cheese. </p>
<p> Are you comfortable with the idea of eating green pasta? Don't worry – the colour is completely natural, coming from the creamy mix of fresh basil leaves (PDO-protected Genovese basil if possible, since the original recipe is from Liguria and its aroma is unique), garlic, coarse salt, pine nuts, grated Pecorino and Parmesan with a drizzle of delicate extra virgin olive oil. The original recipe requires gentle grinding with a pestle and mortar so as not to ‘heat’ the raw ingredients. Pesto sauce is usually used to season long pasta such as spaghetti or trenette (similar to spaghetti but with an elliptical instead of round shape) or with short pasta such as trofie. A local version also includes potatoes and green beans. </p>
<p> Spaghetti alla puttanesca </p>
<p> Another delicious ‘last minute’ recipe, very common in Naples and Southern Italy, especially during summer when the tomatoes are amazingly tasty and the weather too hot to spend long hours in the kitchen. Basically a richer version of spaghetti al pomodoro, puttanesca also includes capers, oregano and the delicious black Gaeta olives, which give the dish its unique, savoury taste. Some more modern recipes also include anchovies and chilli. The curious name – which is an Italian word for prostitute – is said to refer to the fact that it was a popular dish in Neapolitan brothels. </p>
<p> If tomatoes are the staple of Naples and Southern Italian cooking, Pecorino cheese and guanciale (cured pork made from pig cheek) are the staples in Rome. Starting from these two intensely tasty ingredients, a number of delicious pasta recipes were born. One of these is amatriciana – many Italians still quarrel about how to name it, with or without the initial ‘a’ (matriciana), but the name clearly refers to the mountain village of Amatrice, where the best guanciale comes from. It is one of the most popular Roman recipes; a rich and flavourful pasta dish made with tomato sauce, small crunchy guanciale chunks and plenty of grated Pecorino cheese. An older version of the recipe called gricia, still very popular in Rome's restaurants, did not include tomato, and adding other ingredients such as garlic or onion would result in fierce resentment from any proper Italian foodie. Amatriciana sauce can go both with long (spaghetti or the thicker bucatini, with a hole – buco – running through the centre) and short pasta, namely rigatoni (ridged pasta can better hold the sauce). In 2008, Italy issued a special stamp dedicated to amatriciana. </p>
<p> Carbonara </p>
<p> Another unmissable Roman classic: in this case, egg yolk (some also use a small quantity of egg white) is the main ingredient, together with the ‘usual’ guanciale (some prefer bacon) and Pecorino cheese, sometimes mixed with Parmesan. Absolutely no cream or milk is added, according to the original recipe. The result should be a creamy, smooth and rich yellow sauce with the pork lending a nice crispy texture. It’s easier said than done to get the right balance between egg yolk and white (if used), and you need to be fast when adding the egg and cheese mix to the cooked pasta when it is still very hot so the sauce will ‘cook’ without curdling. Carbonara is usually made with spaghetti, rigatoni or penne, and its origins are uncertain: the name could refer to the Carbonari (‘charcoal men’, also the name of a secret society), but according to a popular opinion it could have been invented in Rome in 1944 by US soldiers with a craving for their beloved eggs and bacon breakfast after the allied liberation of the city. </p>
<p> Spaghetti cacio e pepe </p>
<p> Literally meaning ‘cheese and pepper’, this popular Roman recipe basically features the two ingredients – black pepper and Pecorino cheese – and nothing else, besides pasta. Once again, ‘simple’ does not mean ‘easy’; the aim is to obtain a delicious and creamy sauce by skilfully mixing the grated cheese (and ground pepper) with the hot, drained pasta, stirring until it perfectly melts. It’s vital to add some of the pasta’s hot cooking water, which is rich in starch, to the dish to soften the cheese. Preparing a perfect cacio e pepe is an art only a few can truly master. </p>
<p> Ziti alla Genovese </p>
<p> This could be confusing: Genovese sauce bears the name of the northern Italian city of Genoa, but the irresistible scent of this dish – for those who love onions, at least – is from Naples in the south. Both the name and the recipe could have actually originated in Genoa, introduced to Naples by the sailors coming from Liguria. Today though, there is no trace of a similar dish in Genoa, while pasta alla Genovese is a key feature of a Neapolitan Sunday lunch, when breaking the handmade ziti – long tubes of pasta resembling large macaroni which have to be cut into smaller pieces to cook and eat – is part of local tradition. The rich, onion-based sauce is slowly-cooked for hours, together with minced carrots and celery, chunks of meat and pieces of lard. The final result is a thick, creamy sauce, where the onions have completely melted and the meat is soft and easily pulled apart. Grated Parmesan or Pecorino is often sprinkled over the pasta, and the pink sweet onions found growing in Campania are perfect for cooking this particular dish. </p>
<p> Ragù </p>
<p> The ubiquitous word found in many Italian menus from north to south, comes from the French term ragôut and generally refers to every kind of long-cooked, meat-based sauce. The two main versions of authentic, proper ragù, though, are from Naples and Emilia-Romagna. Neapolitan ragù is a rich, intense red sauce obtained by the slow, extremely long simmering of tomato sauce with soffritto (the Italian version of mirepoix, made of finely chopped onion, parsley and celery), basil and big pieces of mixed meat which, once cooked, are served as a main course after pasta. A real symbol of Neapolitan cooking, ragù is the alternative to pasta alla Genovese for Sunday dinner. The Bolognese version uses finely chopped or even ground meat, a lesser quantity of tomato and onion and includes white or red wine. Sometimes lard, milk and offal is added, too. The result is a creamy or grainy pale red sauce usually used with fresh egg pasta such as tagliatelle or fettuccine. </p>
<p> A staple of southern Italian summer meals and very popular along the coast of the country, this dish is best enjoyed whilst looking out over the sea. A basic aglio e olio (garlic and oil) sauce – with a bit of chilli if preferred – is cooked in a huge pan, before lots of clams are added and sautéed until they open and flavour the sauce. Vongole veraci (carpet shell clams) are the best variety for this dish. Once the pasta – usually spaghetti and always a long variety – is cooked and drained, it is added to the clam sauce and quickly mixed in with finely chopped parsley. Some prefer a slippery, oily sauce while others prefer something creamier which ‘wraps’ around the spaghetti, using the pasta's natural starch. A tomato-based version of the same recipe is common, too. </p>
<p> Spaghetti ai ricci </p>
<p> Made in the same way as spaghetti con le vongole, using the sweet orange pulp (basically, the roe) of sea urchins, this dish is most popular in Puglia. Some use cream but it completely spoils the flavour of the urchins. The pulp should be freshly extracted from the shells and added at the very end, quickly cooking the pasta with the sauce until it melts and forms a delicate cream, resulting in an unusual yet delicious experience. </p>
<p> Belonging to the Italian tradition of minestre – dishes made by cooking pasta in a sort of broth together with other ingredients such as vegetables, potatoes or beans – this combination of chickpeas and pasta is a simple, delicious, warming and deeply satisfying recipe. The secret lays in using good quality soaked dried chickpeas, an intense extra virgin olive oil and a sprig of rosemary for added flavour. Usually short pasta or broken spaghetti is used for minestre, and while northern Italians usually eat it with more liquid, in southern Italy a thicker, creamier version is preferred, obtained by blending some of the legumes and slowly cooking the pasta with a small amount of water or broth until half-cooked and letting it rest for a short time. </p>

<p> Traditional Sapa Sui (Samoan Chop Suey) </p>
<p> I love this recipe! It's cheap, delicious and fast to prepare. It comes from an old boyfriend's mum. She is Samoan and a great cook. As this is a Samoan recipe, you can bet it's going to feed a small army. </p>
<p> INGREDIENTS </p>
<p> g mung beans, vermicelli they are also called cellophane (found in the asian section of your supermarket) or 1 glass noodles </p>
<p> garlic cloves, crushed (or a good tablespoon of the prepared garlic in a jar) </p>
<p> 1 </p>
<p> tablespoon of fresh grated gingerroot (or 1 tb of ginger from a jar) </p>
<p> 300 </p>
<p> g mincemeat (all meats are fine, beef, chicken or pork) or 500 g of chopped meat (all meats are fine, beef, chicken or pork) </p>
<p> DIRECTIONS </p>
<p> In a large pan, fry the onion, garlic and ginger until the onion is translucent over a med/high heat. </p>
<p> Add and fry the meat for no more than 2 minutes It needs to be just seared. Stir so it doesn't burn. </p>
<p> Add the soy sauce and water (the water should almost cover the meat - not totally). Let simmer over a med. heat while you prepare the noodles (about 5 minutes). </p>
<p> Prepare the noodles as per the pack instructions (place hot water in a bowl and add the noodles, let stand until they are re-hydrated and plyable). </p>
<p> Snip the noodles, you want each strand to be short. </p>
<p> Add the noodles plus 1 cup of the water from the noodles. </p>
<p> Add the remaining ingredients. It will look soupy - this is normal. </p>
<p> Stir and let simmer over a medium heart for 10-15 minutes. </p>

<p> Vasilopita (Greek New Year's Cake) </p>
<p> A resident of Greece, Nancy Gaifyllia is a cook who writes about the country's regional specialties. </p>
<p> *The % Daily Value (DV) tells you how much a nutrient in a food serving contributes to a daily diet. 2,000 calories a day is used for general nutrition advice. </p>
<p> (Nutrition information is calculated using an ingredient database and should be considered an estimate.) </p>
<p> In Greek: βασιλόπιτα, pronounced vah-see-LO-pee-tah </p>
<p> Of all the Vasilopita recipes, this one is the best for making at home because the texture is lovely (like a granular pound cake) and it lends itself to decoration, which is fun for kids. The recipe calls for self-rising flour. </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> 3/4 cup of butter </p>
<p> 1 1/2 cups of sugar </p>
<p> 6 eggs </p>
<p> Steps to Make It </p>
<p> Bring all ingredients to room temperature, and preheat the oven to 390 F/200 C. </p>
<p> Cream the butter in a mixing bowl. Beating continuously, add in order: the sugar, very slowly, then the eggs one at a time, and finally the brandy. </p>
<p> Still beating, sprinkle in the grated orange peel to distribute evenly throughout the batter. Add milk, then flour, a small amount at a time. </p>
<p> Flour a round 12" to 13" diameter tapsi (baking pan with 2 to 3" sides) and pour in the batter. </p>
<p> The cake will bake for a total of about 45 minutes, but halfway through, when it has started to set, wrap a coin in foil and insert the coin carefully into the dough, pushing it down just below the surface. (Inserting the coin when the cake is slightly firmed will prevent it from sinking to the bottom.) Insert it anywhere except the exact center of the cake. </p>
<p> Continue baking until done. Allow to cool for 5 minutes. Place a large plate over the top of the tapsi and invert it so the cake comes out on the plate. Take a second plate (for serving) and put it over the cake, invert to get the cake right side up. </p>
<p> Allow the Vasilopita to cool for 4 hours before serving. </p>
<p> Topping & Decorations </p>
<p> Coat lightly with marmalade and sprinkle with grated coconut (decorations optional). </p>
<p> Traditions of Cutting the Vasilopita </p>
<p> Each family has its own tradition for cutting the Vasilopita, but they all have one thing in common: the wish for good fortune in the new year. Traditionally, pieces are cut ceremoniously by the head of the household and allocated to the church (Holy Trinity and Virgin Mary), then the head of the household (male), his wife, their children (oldest to youngest), other family members by the degree of relatedness, then guests. The coin or small medallion (flouri, pronounced floo-REE) is a tradition symbolizing an extra measure of good fortune for whoever gets the piece where it has been hidden during baking, and this can cause serious confrontation if ownership of the coin is disputed. Therefore: </p>
<p> when inserting the coin, insert parallel to the way a knife will cut so it will remain in one piece; </p>
<p> when making the first cut, declare loudly who gets the pieces on either side of the knife so there are no disputes; </p>
<p> if a coin does end up between two pieces, the piece that has the larger part gets the coin. </p>
<p> I don't like this at all. It's not the worst. Sure, this will do. I'm a fan—would recommend. Amazing! I love it! Thanks for your rating! </p>

<p> Pan-Fried Pork Chops with Rosemary & Garlic Serves 6 </p>
<p> Ingredients </p>
<p> Heat oven to 350. </p>
<p> 1 TB coarse sea salt 1 TB coarse-ground black pepper 1 TB fresh rosemary, finely minced 1/2 TB garlic powder 2 TB olive oil 8 Pork chops, 1 inch thick, well-marbled, bone-in </p>
<p> Combine salt, pepper, rosemary and garlic powder in a small bowl. Rub a lighter layer of the mix on both sides of the pork chops and let sit for 30 minutes. </p>
<p> Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops to the pan and cook without moving them until caramelized and brown on one side. Turn the chops over and cook the other side for 1 to 2 minutes. You may need to do this in two batches if your pan does not hold all 8 chops at one time. </p>
<p> Transfer the pork chops to a heated baking sheet, and put in the oven to finish cooking for 5 to 6 minutes. The pork chops are done when they’re still a little pink inside and an instant-read thermometer reads between 140 and 145 degrees F. </p>
<p> Transfer the chops to a plate or platter and let them rest in a warm spot for 5 to 6 minutes before serving. </p>

<p> ASMR is also sleep aid, stress and anxiety relief. If you're looking for affordable and convenient therapy, I've partnered with BetterHelp: 👉 https://www.tryonlinetherapy.com/Barber </p>
<p> Traditional old style Italian barber shop. Very accurate and slow movements, background relaxing noises. An old man with a huge experience uses scissors and comb to rafine his job. Take a chance to relax, try ASMR and let me know your opinions, it will be very appreciated, thanks. . </p>
<p> Guys, if you are looking for the t-shirts and the shaving products we used during our last trip in India below you can find the links :-) Now are only available on amazon.it, but soon they will be available worldwide. :-) For any request just let me know. </p>
<p> What is ASMR? ASMR is a complex name to define a very simple sensation: TINGLES mainly located on the top of the head. This tingles may be triggered by a lot of things: 1)Whispers, slow speech, soft spoken voices 2)Massages 3)Personal attention from someone 4)Watching other people performing simple tasks 5)Any type of Role Play 6)Haircuts (yes my channel is based on this :) ) and lots more. </p>
<p> Personally I have discovered ASMR through a youtube video: Baba World's Greatest Head Massage Anyway for other triggers I suggest to take a look of GentleWhispering (the real youtube ASMR superstar), MassageASMR (that combine two of the most powerful triggers, whispering and massage) and finally the Bob Ross deep voice, a painter that was the first ASMR artist. </p>
<p> Thanks again for watching. Massimo </p>

<p> Say goodbye to dry and flavorless pork chops! Masterchef John Zhang shares a few simple tricks on how you can make juicy and tender pork chop at home with step by step instruction. Plus, a special dip / sauce recipe with pair with the pork chop. </p>
<p> When cooked properly, a nice thick pork chop can be an incredibly delicious, tender, juicy, and versatile cut of meat. </p>
<p> Tips: 1. For most pork chop preparations, look for bone-in pork chops about 1.5-inches thick. Why go with bone-in? Well, the bone actually slows the cooking time for a few minutes, which makes a great difference. </p>
<p> 2. Don’t cook chops straight from the refrigerator. Thirty minutes before you plan to cook, take the pork chops out of the fridge. The time out of the refrigerator lets you bring the meat up to room temperature, which helps the pork cook more evenly throughout. </p>
<p> 3. Marinade the meat: a great pork chop marinade that will make your pork extra juicy with a terrific savory flavor. </p>

<p> One pan pork chops in mushroom and garlic gravy is out of this world, not to mention simple. The great thing is, this dish can be made in 30 minutes. This makes it a great midweek meal for the busy person. Your family will simply love it. </p>
<p> I use boneless pork chops as they are so much easier to work with, but bone-in or butterfly chops will work too. Use the cut of meat of your choice. </p>
<p> In terms of the spices, you can use as much or as little as you like. For example, if you care a garlic lover, use more; if you are not a garlic lover, use less. It is entirely up to you. </p>

<p> Pork chops with peppers is a versatile one-pan dish. I made it with pork chops but it works just as well with sausage or your favorite cuts of chicken. You can have dinner on your table in way less than an hour and clean up is a breeze. </p>
<p> Come to think of it this wouldn't be bad with firm tofu slices instead of meat. </p>
<p> The trick to this one-pan dish is to cook the ingredients separately and then put everything back in the pan with a simple pan sauce to finish cooking. </p>
<p> If you want an easy meal jam-packed with flavor and texture this one's for you. </p>
<p> The golden crusted tender pork chops are delicious all by themselves. But wait there's more. </p>
<p> Add some sweet carmelized onions, bell and cherry vinegar pepper to every bite and your taste buds will be in full swing. And then there are the golden potatoes with the creamy interior. </p>
<p> What more could you hope for and it all came out of just one pan. </p>
<p> Special appearance by my 100-year-old vinegar mother! </p>

<p> Unfortunately, I can't cover all the different ways you can cook a Perfect Pork Chop in one video. Here, I focus on of of the most popular - Pan Roasting, and give you some key tips to use for any cooking method you end up using. </p>
<p> The perfect pan roasted pork chop, has a great sear on the outside with a crispy, flavorful crust. The perfect pork chop is also just cooked through, so the center is still juicy and tender. Finally, the perfect pork shop is easily attainable, once you know the techniques - Here are my 10 Steps for the Perfect Chop: 1) Buy a good, thick, pork chop 2) Brine and season the pork chop 3) Bring it to room temperature before cooking 4) Use high heat 5) Start cooking the chop on the stove top in a pan 6) Sear the sides to render that fat 7) Finish the pork chop in the oven 8) Cook it to medium well (at most) 9) Let the pork chop rest 10) Use the pan drippings for a quick sauce </p>

<p> The best way to cook up a thick steak is to sear the beef on the stove top and then finish off the steak in the oven. In this video, I'm cooking a top sirloin steak filet. You can cook the perfect steak with just a little salt and pepper and a good cut of meat, and telling when a steak is done is quite easy as well. Check out our steak video and tell me what you think. A printable copy of this top sirloin steak recipe and more information about cooking steak in the kitchen can be found at http://www.myfoodchannel.com/sirloin-... Give this steak recipe a try and let me know what you think, and for more recipes check out the Chef Buck playlist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=... and to print all recipes visit my website at http://www.myfoodchannel.com/ </p>
<p> Choose a good cut of beef …the perfect steak is never the cheapest steak. Marbled steak will be juicy steak …zero fat = zero flavor. Let the steak come to room temperature before cooking. Season the steak well, on both sides, with coarse salt and pepper. Preheat your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. On the stove top, heat a little oil in a heavy-bottomed, oven safe skillet. Add steak to the hot skillet. The beef should sizzle when it hits the pan. Sear on medium high heat for approx 2 minutes. Turn steak with tongs and sear other side for 1 minute. Slide the skillet into the oven and continue to cook until desired temperature. Test the doneness of the steak by pressing it with your fingers. Steak becomes firm as it cooks. A well done steak is very firm, and a rare steak very malleable. Poking or slicing the steak to check for temperature will result in loss of juices, so this should be avoided. When steak is almost cooked to desired doneness, remove the steak from the oven and skillet and place on a plate to rest for 5 minutes. The internal temperature of the steak will continue to rise for a few moments after leaving the oven. Allowing the steak rest for 5 minutes before serving will preserve the juiciness of the cut. </p>

<p> FAQ: Who is this lady? Gina Petitti was born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy. Her family ran a farm in Italy and she met her husband, Vito, in the same town. In 1970 Gina, Vito, and her 4 children immigrated to America. Gina’s husband passed away in 2012, but she is surrounded by a large family, which includes 9 grandchildren, and lives 5 minutes away from her eldest daughter in New Jersey. Gina spends her time cooking, gardening, and being an active member of her local Church. </p>
<p> Where does Gina get her recipes? Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things. </p>
<p> Why does she make such large portions? When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldn’t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out! </p>
<p> Why is no one helping her in the video? Grandma Gina doesn’t want help! Usually, it’s because we will slow her down or not do it “her way.” For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step. </p>
<p> Why don’t we buy her a new...? Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etc… but she doesn’t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty! </p>
<p> Who is behind the camera? Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen. </p>
<p> Does Gina read the comments? We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking! Your comments bring her lots of joy, laughter, and inspiration to make more videos to share with you. </p>

<doc id="file14875008" filename="wedding-cake-traditions-486933" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.thespruceeats.com/wedding-cake-traditions-486933">
<p> 7 Wedding Cake Traditions and Their Meanings </p>
<p> Michelle Anderson is a professional pastry chef and cake decorator with over two decades experience. </p>
<p> A gorgeous wedding cake is often the centerpiece of a wedding and it typically sits in a place of honor at the reception. This carefully planned confection is a longstanding tradition dating back to Roman and Medieval times. </p>
<p> Back then, a stack of buns was used instead of a multi-level culinary masterpiece, but the symbolism was generally the same. Over the centuries there have been many traditions created surrounding the cake and it still remains an important aspect of any wedding. </p>
<p> It's important to take the time to plan a cake that reflects the couple and keep in mind all the various customs created around wedding cakes. </p>
<p> Cutting the Cake </p>
<p> Along with the first dance and bouquet toss, this charming tradition is one of those photo opportunities that graces every wedding album. The cake cutting represents the first activity done as a couple, although historically the bride did this act alone to symbolize the loss of her virginity. </p>
<p> Cake cutting became a more complicated process as cakes became multi-tiered and the number of guests reached the hundreds. These days, the bride requires the groom's assistance and usually they do not cut the entire cake up, but instead leave that duty to the caterer. </p>
<p> The Bride and Groom Feeding Each Other Cake </p>
<p> The second act of the traditional cake cutting ceremony is when the bride and groom feed each other a small bite of cake. This can be romantic and sweet, symbolizing a commitment to provide for one another and a show of love and affection. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, this custom has evolved in some cases to the groom or bride grinding the cake into his or her partner's face. Unless each person agrees beforehand to participate in this type of show, it is best to stick with a simple feeding. </p>
<p> The Groom's Cake </p>
<p> Early American weddings had groom's cakes and southern states in the U.S. continue to perpetuate this wedding tradition. Many modern weddings have resurrected the tradition of this cake to showcase the groom's hobbies, individual taste, and even their favorite sports teams. </p>
<p> Groom's cakes are usually chocolate to contrast the actual wedding cake, although any flavor is acceptable. </p>
<p> Saving the Top Tier </p>
<p> Most couples cannot resist saving the top tier of their wedding cake to eat on their first anniversary or a christening ceremony. In the past, christenings were often within a year of the wedding so this made perfect sense. Now, most couples are more likely to create a small cake eating ceremony around their first anniversary. Sharing this small cake is a charming reminder of a special day. </p>
<p> A well-wrapped cake can easily survive a year in the deep freezer without too much damage, as long as the cake has no mousse layers or delicate fresh fruit fillings. </p>
<p> Sleeping With Piece of Cake Under the Pillow </p>
<p> It is thought that a person sleeping with a piece of wedding cake under her pillow will dream of her future partner that night. This custom dates back almost 300 years and is often practically combined with wedding favors being tiny, perfect replicas of the wedding cake. </p>
<p> Cakes in modern times are sometimes not as firm as the traditional fruitcake used in the past, so having it under a pillow could get messy! A favor in a box is a much neater solution. </p>
<p> Wedding Cake Charms </p>
<p> The custom of baking charms into wedding cakes is a longstanding one which has fallen into disuse. It is an absolutely delightful tradition to try as long as you warn the guests to be careful and remove their charm before eating the cake!​​ </p>
<p> A more practical variation is pushing the charms into a baked cake with a ribbon attached so the guest can simply pull the charm out. </p>
<p> There are several charms that are used traditionally and each has a specific meaning: </p>
<p> The White Wedding Cake </p>
<p> White icing was also a symbol of money and social importance in Victorian times, so a white cake was highly desired. The fine white sugar needed to create white icing was extremely expensive and the lighter the cake, the more wealthy the family would appear to their guests. </p>
<p> The white of the cake was simply a representation of the bride as the main focal point of the wedding. Many brides today mimic this continuity by creating cakes in the same hue as their dress or bouquet. </p>
<p> Wedding cakes can be any color, but most people still feel the base color beyond the decorations should be white. White is, of course, the color of purity and traditionally this cake was referred to as the "bride's cake." </p>

<p> Categories </p>
<p> Going Pro: What Cookware do Professional Chefs Use at Home? </p>
<p> Chefs are the experts of the culinary world. Not only can they follow a recipe and create the perfect finished product, but they’re also the leaders in the culinary field who create their own unique dishes and introduce up to entirely new flavors and textures. </p>
<p> Do you ever wonder what cookware do professional chefs use? Are you interested in a career as a pro chef or do you love cooking and want to use the same style and type of cookware that world-famous chefs use in their own homes? </p>
<p> Or maybe you’re a beginner and you’re uncertain what type of pots and pans to buy, or even where to begin? </p>
<p> Chefs typically use the same style and type of pots and pans at work that they do at home. Why? Because the cookware works well and provides the desired results. </p>
<p> If you’re not sure what type of pots and pans to use and what material to choose, you’re in luck. We’ve included many of the same types of pieces you’ll find in any chef’s kitchen cupboards, in addition to the what kind of cookware they prefer working with, whether it’s copper, carbon steel, cast iron, or aluminum. </p>
<p> What cookware do professional chefs use? Answer: Most of the pros tend to lean more toward cookware that’s made out of cast iron, carbon steel, or copper. The kind of material the cookware is made out of often depends on the type of the pot or pan. As an example, most chefs can agree that a skillet made out of cast iron is the way to go. For every day cooking on the stovetop, copper is the big favorite. Chefs do not recommend using cookware that’s made out of aluminum if you often cook acidic foods. They also advise us to steer clear of potentially harmful cookware, such as Teflon. </p>
<p> It may be surprising to learn that some of the cookware in your own kitchen is the same type that’s used by professional chefs all over the world. But we guarantee that you’ll also find cookware that’s not in your kitchen, but should definitely be on your list whether you’re a serious cook or a casual one. </p>
<p> Keep on reading to learn about the best cookware options for home use. </p>
<p> Table of Contents </p>
<p> The Chef’s Cookware Arsenal </p>
<p> Have you ever wondered what type of cookware do chefs use at home? The type of pots and pans they purchase for home use can vary based on the chef, their cooking style, the type of food they cook, and basically, personal preference. Some chefs prefer to try newer cookware technology, such as carbon steel, while others will stick to their personal favorites such as cast iron skillets. </p>
<p> You don’t have to run out and buy a wide range of pot and pan styles. Often, many chefs admit that all you really need are a few good saucepans, the perfect skillet, and a large stock pot. This can also depend on the size of the meals you normally prepare and the dishes you enjoy cooking. </p>
<p> Frying Pans </p>
<p> Your basic frying pan features rounded edges and a flat bottom. These pans are made out of carbon steel, cast iron, stainless steel, copper, tempered glass, aluminum, and more. </p>
<p> Newer styles of frying pans include stainless steel lined copper cookware, carbon steel, and titanium. </p>
<p> This style of pan is used mainly to fry, sear, or pan roast meats. The term frying pan and skillet are often used interchangeably, although some kitchen pros argue that a skillet is thicker and larger. However, both styles of pans can be used to cook many of the same dishes. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: Chefs recommend frying pans made out of copper, cast iron, or carbon steel. </p>
<p> Skillet </p>
<p> As we mentioned, frying pans are often confused with skillets. Skillets are typically larger, heavier, and designed to cook a higher volume of food. Every home and professional kitchen has one. Skillets are made out of the same types of materials as frying pans, but feature a thicker construction and are often much heavier compared to a standard frying pan. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: Any chef will tell you that no kitchen is complete without a well-seasoned cast iron skillet. This type of cookware is very heavy and features a seasoning that’s made out of oil and baked several times. Seasoning the skillet gives it a type of nonstick surface that makes both cooking and cleaning much easier. The cast iron skillet is also very versatile and can go straight from the stove right into the oven, with the ability to handle higher than average temperatures compared to other types of cookware. </p>
<p> However, while many old-school chefs claim that a cast iron skillet is the go-to choice, modern chefs claim that carbon steel skillets are a much better option. </p>
<p> Like the cast iron skillet, the carbon steel skillet must also go through a seasoning process, but unlike the cast iron skillet, cookware made out of carbon steel is very light, making it easier to use and lift. Both offer a comparable performance and price. Ultimately, the type of skillet you choose will boil down to personal preference, but one thing is clear, every chef has at least one of these skillets in their home kitchen. </p>
<p> Sauté Pans </p>
<p> As the name explains it, this style of pan is used for sautéing. Sautéing food means moving food around in the pan while frying it. This cooking process requires very little oil. This style of pan is similar to the frying pan, however, the sauté pan is not as shallow as the frying pan and it usually has deeper edges. This type of pan is perfect if you want to sauté veggies or tender cuts of meat. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: Chefs recommend copper sauté pans. Copper has a reputation for heating up food quickly, maintaining the proper temperature, and you won’t have any hot spots in the pan, making copper the best choice for delicate dishes. Sets such as the Cuisinart 10pc Tri-Ply Cooper Cookware Set includes pro-worthy copper cookware that’s perfect for home cooks who need a cookware upgrade and pots and pans that can deliver improved cooking efficiency and better results than their outdated cookware can. </p>
<p> Saucepans </p>
<p> The saucepan is used to cook sauce, soup, boil eggs, veggies, or pasta, and it’s also often the go-to pan when it comes to reheating food. This versatile little pan is a staple in home and professional kitchens. The pan’s design consists of a rounded bottom and tall sides. Most saucepans will also come with a lid that’s used to prevent the liquid in the pan from evaporating. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: Most pros recommend using saucepans that are made out of copper, pure ceramic, or ceramic coated cookware. Stainless steel can also be a great choice if you’re on a budget and don’t cook delicate dishes often. Copper is the go-to choice because of its ability to cook food evenly, a must if you’re dealing with a delicate soup or sauce. Pure ceramic and ceramic coated cookware can be a good choice as well if you’re looking for a safe nonstick cookware to use to reheat foods. </p>
<p> Brazier Pans </p>
<p> The brazier pan is another important staple in a commercial kitchen, but they’re also great for home use as well. These pans feature a moisture locking lid and a flat-bottomed pan design. These pans are typically used to slow-cook food in the oven or slowly brown food on a stovetop. </p>
<p> This pan is typically made out of either aluminum or stainless steel and is available in a variety of sizes. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: Chefs often choose stainless steel braziers for home and commercial use. These sturdy, large capacity pans are durable, feature a decent heft, and are pretty easy to clean if you use a moderately abrasive cleanser. </p>
<p> Griddle Pans </p>
<p> Griddle pans are perfect for commercial kitchens, providing a large nonstick cooking surface. Typically, these pans feature a large square shape and are equipped with a handle. Some griddles designed for home use are made out of Teflon, while others are made out of cast iron. These pans are perfect for cooking eggs, hot dogs, and pancakes in larger volumes. It can also be used for grilling chicken breast, hamburgers, sausages, and more. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: All chefs can agree that you should steer clear of Teflon at all costs. Teflon cookware is coated with a nonstick interior that’s designed to prevent food from sticking to the surface, making it easier to cook with and significantly minimizing cleanup. However, when the cookware reaches five hundred degrees it begins to emit harmful fumes. Over time, the nonstick coating starts to break down with regular use, leaving flakes of the coating behind in your food. To learn more about what cookware is safe, click here to read our guide on the safest cookware. </p>
<p> Cast iron is often a much better, safer choice. Griddles, like cast iron skillets, must be seasoned in order to develop the type of nonstick coating that can be crucial if you’re frying eggs or you want to cook your pancakes to perfection. These heavier griddles can be difficult to clean, but if you keep up on the seasoning you’ll find that no other type or style of griddle will work as hard for you as a cast iron one can. </p>
<p> Wok </p>
<p> Woks are commonly used to cook a variety of Asian dishes. The pan is edgeless and features a very smooth slope with a round bottom and a handle on each side of the pan. These pans are normally used for cooking noodles and stir frying veggies. While not every chef will use this style of cookware in their pro kitchen, most have a wok or two at home. </p>
<p> Pro Recommendation: The pros often go with woks that are made out of carbon steel. This type of wok features a nonstick surface that’s comparable to that of Teflon, without the use of harsh chemicals. Versatile, lightweight, and easy to clean, you’ll be surprised by how many uses the traditional wok has. </p>
<p> Related Questions </p>
<p> What is a Chef’s Pan? </p>
<p> The chef’s pan is similar to a frying pan, however, it’s much deeper and features sloped sides. This design allows the chef to easily add and mix ingredients as they’re cooking. </p>
<p> Do Chefs Use Cast Iron? </p>
<p> Yes. In fact, you’ll be hard pressed to find a chef that doesn’t have their own favorite cast iron griddle or skillet at work and at home. This type of cookware material is very durable, but it’s heavier design may make it unsuitable for some users. Carbon steel is said to be a better alternative since it offers the many of the same benefits as cast iron, but is much lighter. </p>
<p> Is a Wok Better than a Frying Pan? </p>
<p> This depends on what you’re cooking. Is it a better choice for cooking noodles or stir-frying veggies? Yes. Is it a better option for frying an egg? No. The frying pan uses less oil and is a much safer option for beginners. It’s also a better choice if you have a gas oven since the open flame tends to burn the sides of the wok. </p>
<p> Is Enameled Cast Iron Expensive? </p>
<p> Yes, much more so than traditional cast iron. The enamel coating gives the cookware a nonstick surface, which means you won’t have to worry about seasoning the pan. This is a huge plus for some chefs, however, others still prefer the traditional cast iron cookware mainly because many cooks claim that food simply tastes better when it’s cooked in a seasoned cast iron skillet. Keep in mind that enamel coated cast iron will also be heavier compared to traditional cast iron, which can make it unsuitable for some cooks. </p>
<p> Final Thoughts </p>
<p> What cookware do professional chefs use? Most will mainly use copper, carbon steel, and cast iron. Each of these materials can offer different benefits depending on the type of food or dish you’re cooking and even the style of the pot or pan. However, the pros do not recommend using Teflon or other types of pans that are coated with artificial nonstick surfaces. </p>

<p> What Is Sicilian Pizza? </p>
<p> The original Italian version is called sfincione </p>
<p> Freelance food and travel writer, author, and cookbook editor. She has 15 years of experience in writing for major publications. </p>
<p> When it comes to ordering pizza, in addition to picking pizza toppings, we also have to choose what type of pizza we want—whether thin-crust, deep-dish, regular, or Sicilian. Most of us know Sicilian as the ultra-thick, square pie topped with sauce and cheese. However, Sicilian pizza has two variations: the kind that originated in Sicily, Italy, and the version that evolved in New York and the rest of the United States. </p>
<p> Italian Sicilian Pizza </p>
<p> The original, authentic version from Sicily comes from Palermo and is called sfincione, which loosely translates as "thick sponge." Sicilian pizza has a fluffy, spongy bread base topped with a meatless sauce made from tomatoes, onions, herbs, and anchovies, which is covered with breadcrumbs and an optional grating of hard cheese. It is then baked in a square tray. Traditional sfincione does not use mozzarella because most of the milk produced in Sicily comes from sheep and goats, not cows. You will find sfincione usually sold in bakeries or panificios. </p>
<p> Traditionally, meatless sfincione is served on December 7 (which is the eve of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception), Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and Good Friday, but it is also enjoyed all year long. In warmer months it is usually served at room temperature. </p>
<p> History of Sicilian Pizza </p>
<p> In Sicily, pizza and sfincione were popular by the mid-19th century. It is likely that sfincione evolved from the much older focaccia, Italian yeast bread that is baked in a flat sheet pan. Then sfincione evolved into what we today call Sicilian-style pizza in the United States. </p>
<p> Sicilian-style pizza was brought to the United States by Sicilian immigrants. The addition of mozzarella was most likely due to the fact that Italian bakeries in New York City would have had access to cheap mozzarella due to New York State's dairy cow industry in the early 20th century. Soon, the term pizza began to encompass any type of bread-crust topped with sauce and cheese. </p>
<p> Returning World War II soldiers who had been stationed in Italy clamored for the taste of pizza, Sicilian or otherwise, in New York, Boston, and Detroit, and a culinary trend began. In fact, Detroit-style pizza is a descendant of Sicilian pizza. </p>
<p> In New York and the rest of the United States, what has become known as Sicilian-Style pizza has the same thick, square base, but it is usually topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Sometimes the sauce is on top of the cheese. </p>
<p> Ingredients of Sicilian Pizza </p>
<p> An authentic Sicilian pizza or sfincione is made with a thick, spongy dough. This mixture of flour, water, yeast, and olive oil is left to rise and then pressed into a well-oiled square baking pan. The crust is then topped with a sauce made from onions sautéed in olive oil, chopped anchovies, tomatoes, and spices like oregano and crushed red pepper. </p>
<p> The sauce is covered with breadcrumbs and grated caciocavallo cheese and then baked in a hot oven. The spongy dough will soak up the olive oil at the bottom of the pan and create a crispy, charred bottom, while the middle will remain soft and spongy. </p>
<p> For New York-style Sicilian pizza, the same kind of spongy dough is pressed into a well-oiled square baking pan but topped with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, preferably fresh. </p>

<p> What's Cooking: Veal chop </p>
<p> Posted: Updated: </p>
<p> Chef Pietro Fuschetto, of King Umberto in Elmont, shows News 12's Lily Stolzberg how to make veal chop. </p>
<p> Pound each veal chop to 1/4-inch thickness between sheets of plastic wrap. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and coat each veal chop with flour, dip in eggs, then coat with bread crumbs. </p>
<p> Drizzle one tbsp. of the oil over the bottom of a shallow roasting pan, place the chops in the pan and drizzle another tbsp. of oil over them. </p>
<p> Bake veal chops for 15 to 20 minutes, turning only once. Remove from the oven and place chops on paper towels to absorb excess oil. Spread the bruschetta mixture on top of each chop and serve with lemon wedges. </p>
<p> This recipe works equally well with veal cutlets, chicken cutlets or even pork chops. </p>

<doc id="file14875012" filename="Wok" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wok">
<p> A wok (from Cantonese: 鑊) is a versatile round-bottomed cooking pot, originating in China. It is one of the most common cooking utensils in China and similar pans are also found in parts of East, South and Southeast Asia,[1] as well as becoming a popular niche cookware in all the world. </p>
<p> The wok is thought to have been introduced during the Han dynasty of China, where it was first used to dry grains.[3] It was during the Ming dynasty of China that the wok became popularly used for stir frying.[3] </p>
<p> In his book The Food of China, E.N. Anderson writes:[4] </p>
<p> Wok is a Cantonese word; the Mandarin is Kuo. The wok appears to be a rather recent acquisition as Chinese kitchen furniture goes; it has been around for only two thousand years. The first woks I know of are little pottery models on the pottery stove modes in Han Dynasty tombs. Since the same sort of pan is universal in India and Southeast Asia, where it is known as a Kuali in several languages, I strongly suspect borrowing (probably from India via Central Asia)--kuo must have evolved from some word close to Kuali. </p>
<p> In Indonesia the wok like pan is known as a penggorengan or wajan (also spelled wadjang, from Javanese language, from the root word waja meaning "steel").[5] In Malaysia it is called a kuali (small wok) or kawah (big wok).[5] Similarly in the Philippines, the wok is known as kawali, while bigger pans used for festivals and gatherings are known as kawa.[6][7] In India, a similar pan is called karahi. </p>
<p> In Japan the wok is called a chūkanabe (中華鍋, literally "Chinese pot"). In South India, the Chinese wok became a part of South Indian cooking, where it is called the cheena chatti (literally, "Chinese pot" in Malayalam and Tamil). </p>
<p> A wok and karahi on a Western-style stove. Note that the karahi (right) is sitting on an ordinary burner cover, while the round-bottomed wok is balanced on a wok-ring </p>
<p> The wok's most distinguishing feature is its shape. Classic woks have a rounded bottom.[2] Hand-hammered woks are sometimes flipped inside out after being shaped, giving the wok a gentle flare to the edge that makes it easier to push food up onto the sides of the wok. Woks sold in Western countries are sometimes found with flat bottoms—this makes them more similar to a deep frying pan. The flat bottom allows the wok to be used on an electric stove, where a rounded wok would not be able to fully contact the stove's heating element. A round bottom wok enables the traditional round spatula or ladle to pick all the food up at the bottom of the wok and toss it around easily; this is difficult with a flat bottom. With a gas hob, or traditional pit stove, the bottom of a round wok can get hotter than a flat wok and so is better for stir frying. </p>
<p> Most woks range from 300 to 360 mm (12 to 14 in) or more in diameter. Woks of 360 mm (14 in) (suitable for a family of 3 or 4) are the most common, but home woks can be found as small as 200 mm (8 in) and as large as 910 mm (36 in). Smaller woks are typically used for quick cooking techniques at high heat such as stir frying (Chinese: 炒; pinyin: chǎo). Large woks over a meter wide are mainly used by restaurants or community kitchens for cooking rice or soup, or for boiling water. </p>
<p> The most common materials used in making woks today are carbon steel and cast iron.[2] Although the latter was the most common type used in the past, cooks tend to be divided on whether carbon steel or cast iron woks are superior. </p>
<p> Currently, carbon steel is the most widely used material,[8] being relatively inexpensive compared with other materials,[9] relatively light in weight, providing quick heat conduction as it has a low heat capacity[10], and having reasonable durability. Their light weight makes them easier to lift and quicker to heat. Carbon steel woks, however, tend to be more difficult to season than those made of cast-iron ('seasoning', or carbonizing the cooking surface of a wok, is required to prevent foods from sticking and to remove metallic tastes and odors).[2] Carbon steel woks vary widely in price, style, and quality, which is based on ply and forming technique. The lowest quality steel woks tend to be stamped by machine from a single 'ply' or piece of stamped steel.[2] Less expensive woks have a higher tendency to deform and misshape. Cooking with lower quality woks is also more difficult and precarious since they often have a "hot spot". Higher quality, mass-produced woks are made of heavy gauge (14-gauge or thicker) steel, and are either machine-hammered or made of spun steel.[2] The best quality woks are almost always hand-made, being pounded into shape by hand ("hand hammered") from two or more sheets of carbon steel which are shaped into final form by a ring-forming or hand-forging process.[2][11] </p>
<p> Two types of cast iron woks can be found in the market. Chinese-made cast iron woks are very thin (3 mm (0.12 in)), weighing only a little more than a carbon steel wok of similar size, while cast iron woks typically produced in the West tend to be much thicker (9 mm (0.35 in)), and very heavy.[12] Because of the thickness of the cast iron, Western-style cast iron woks take much longer to bring up to cooking temperature, and their weight also makes stir-frying and bao techniques difficult.[2] </p>
<p> Cast iron woks form a more stable carbonized layer of seasoning which makes it less prone to food sticking on the pan. While cast iron woks are superior to carbon steel woks in heat retention and uniform heat distribution, they respond slowly to heat adjustments and are slow to cool once taken off the fire.[2] Because of this, food cooked in a cast iron wok must be promptly removed from the wok as soon as it is done to prevent overcooking.[2] Chinese-style cast iron woks, although relatively light, are fragile and are prone to shattering if dropped or mishandled.[2] </p>
<p> Steel woks coated with non-stick coatings such as PFA and Teflon, a development originated in Western countries, are now popular in Asia as well.[2] These woks cannot be used with metal utensils, and foods cooked in non-stick woks tend to retain juices instead of browning in the pan.[2] As they necessarily lack the carbonizing or seasoning of the classic steel or iron wok, non-stick woks do not impart the distinctive taste or sensation of "wok hei."[2] The newest nonstick coatings will withstand temperatures of up to 260 °C (500 °F), sufficient for stir-frying.[13][14] Woks are also now being introduced with clad or five-layer construction, which sandwich a thick layer of aluminum or copper between two sheets of stainless steel.[2] Clad woks can cost five to ten times the price of a traditional carbon steel or cast-iron wok, yet cook no better; for this reason they are not used in most professional restaurant kitchens.[2] Clad woks are also slower to heat than traditional woks and not nearly as efficient for stir-frying.[2] </p>
<p> Woks can also be made from aluminium. Although an excellent conductor of heat, it has somewhat inferior thermal capacity as cast iron or carbon steel, it loses heat to convection much faster than carbon steel, and it may be constructed much thinner than cast iron. Although anodized aluminium alloys can stand up to constant use, plain aluminium woks are too soft and damage easily. Aluminium is mostly used for wok lids. </p>
<p> A stick-handled flat-bottomed peking pan. While the surface looks like Teflon, it is actually well-seasoned carbon steel </p>
<p> The handles for woks come in two styles: loops and stick.[2] Loop handles mounted on opposite sides of the wok are typical in southern China.[2] The twin small loop handles are the most common handle type for woks of all types and materials, and are usually made of bare metal. Cooks needing to hold the wok to toss the food in cooking do so by holding a loop handle with a thick towel (though some woks have spool-shaped wooden or plastic covers over the metal of the handle). Cooking with the tossing action in loop-handled woks requires a large amount of hand, arm and wrist strength. Loop handles typically come in pairs on the wok and are riveted, welded or extended from the wok basin. </p>
<p> Stick handles are long, made of steel, and are usually welded or riveted to the wok basin, or are an actual direct extension of the metal of the basin. Stick handles are popular in northern China, where food in the wok is frequently turned with a tossing motion of the arm and wrist when stir-frying food.[2] The classic stick handle is made of hollow hammered steel, but other materials may be used, including wood or plastic-covered hand grips.[2] Because of their popularity in northern China, stick-handled woks are often referred to as "pao woks" or "Peking pans". Stick handles are normally not found on cast iron woks since the wok is either too heavy for the handle or the metal is too thin to handle the tensile stress exerted by the handle.[2] Larger-diameter woks with stick-type handles frequently incorporate a "helper" handle consisting of a loop on the opposite side of the wok, which aids in handling. </p>
<p> The wok can be used in a large number of cooking methods. Before the introduction of Western cookware, it was often used for all cooking techniques including:[2][15] </p>
<p> Boiling: For boiling water, soups, dumplings, or rice. In the latter case, guoba often forms. </p>
<p> Braising: Braised dishes are commonly made using woks. Braising is useful when reducing sauces. </p>
<p> Deep frying: This is usually accomplished with larger woks to reduce splashing, but for deep frying of less food or small food items, small woks are also used. </p>
<p> Pan frying: Food that is fried using a small amount of oil in the bottom of a pan </p>
<p> Roasting: Food may be cooked with dry heat in an enclosed pan with lid. Whole chestnuts are dry roasted by tossing them in a dry wok with several pounds of small stones. </p>
<p> Searing: Food is browned on its outer surfaces through the application of high heat </p>
<p> Smoking: Food can be hot smoked by putting the smoking material in the bottom of the wok while food is placed on a rack above. </p>
<p> Steaming: Done using a dedicated wok for boiling water in combination with steaming baskets </p>
<p> Stewing: Woks are sometimes used for stewing though it is more common in Chinese cuisine to use either stoneware or porcelain for such purposes, especially when longer stewing times are required. Small woks are for hot pot, particularly in Hainan cuisine. These are served at the table over a sterno flame. </p>
<p> Stir frying: Frying food quickly in a small amount of oil over high heat while stirring continuously. </p>
<p> Wok hei (Chinese: 鑊氣; Jyutping: wok6 hei3) literally, the "breath of the wok", is a poetic phrase Grace Young first coined in her cookbook, The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen.[16] In her book, The Breath of a Wok, Young further explores the ideas and concepts of wok hei.[17] An essay called "Wok Hay: The Breath of a Wok" explains how the definition of wok hei varies from cook to cook and how difficult it is to translate the term. Some define it as the "taste of the wok", a "harmony of taste", etc.: "I think of wok hay as the breath of a wok—when a wok breathes energy into a stir-fry, giving foods a unique concentrated flavor and aroma." </p>
<p> The second character is transliterated as qi (chi) according to its Mandarin Chinese pronunciation, so wok hei is sometimes rendered as wok chi in Western cookbooks is the flavour, tastes, and "essence" imparted by a hot wok on food during stir frying.[2][18] It is particularly important for Chinese dishes requiring high heat for fragrance such as char kuay teow and beef chow fun. Out of the Eight Culinary Traditions of China, wok hei is encountered the most in Cantonese cuisine, whereas it may not even be an accepted underlying principle in some of the other Chinese cuisines. </p>
<p> To impart wok hei the traditional way, the food is cooked in a seasoned wok over a high flame while being stirred and tossed quickly.[2] Constant contact with the heat source is crucial as the addition of new ingredients and each toss of the wok inevitably cools the wok down; therefore, cooking over flame is preferred. Consequently, many chefs (especially those with less-than-ideal cookers) may cook in small batches to overcome this problem so that the wok is still as hot as it can be and to avoid "stewing" the food, instead. When cooking over gas stoves or open flame, it additionally allows for the splattering of fine oil particles to catch the flame into the wok; this is easily achieved when experienced chefs toss the wok and can be a demonstration of experience. For these reasons, cooking over an open flame is preferable to other types of stoves. Cooking with coated woks (e.g. nonstick) notably will not give the distinct taste of wok hei, which is partially imbued from previous cooking sessions. In practical terms, the flavour imparted by chemical compounds results from caramelization, Maillard reactions, and the partial combustion of oil that come from charring and searing of the food at very high heat in excess of 200 °C (392 °F).[14] Aside from flavour, the texture of the cooked items and smell involved also describe wok hei. </p>
<p> A Han dynasty Chinese stove model with cooking pots showing the basic attributes that derived to modern wok stoves. </p>
<p> Woks were designed to be used over the traditional Chinese pit-style hearth (Chinese: 竈; pinyin: zào) with the wok recessed into the stove top, where the heat is fully directed at the bottom of the wok. Round grate rings on the edge of the opening provide stability to the wok. There are two styles of traditional wok stoves. The same design aspects of these Chinese stoves can be seen in traditional Japanese kamado stoves. The more primitive style was used outdoors or in well ventilated areas since hot gasses from the firebox exhaust around the wok. The more advanced style, found in better-off households, has a chimney and may be used indoors. These stoves are similar in design to modern rocket stoves. </p>
<p> Pit stoves originally burned wood or coal but are now more typically heated by natural gas with the burner recessed below the stovetop. In areas where natural gas is unavailable, LPG may be used instead. With the adoption of gas and its less objectionable combustion products, the chimney has been replaced by the vent hood. </p>
<p> This type of stove allows foods to be stir-fried at a very high heat, sometimes hot enough to deform the wok itself. Professional chefs in Chinese restaurants often use pit stoves since they have the heating power to give food an alluring wok hei. </p>
<p> Traditionally shaped woks can be used on some Western-style (flat-topped) gas stoves by removing a burner cover and replacing it with a "wok ring", which provides stability and concentrates heat. Although not as ideal as "pit stoves", these allow woks to be used in a manner more suitable for their design and are good enough for most tasks required in home cooking.[15] </p>
<p> Wok rings are sold in cylindrical and conical shapes. For greatest efficiency with the conical wok ring, position it with the wide side up. This allows the base of the wok to sit closer to the heat source. </p>
<p> In recent years, some consumer indoor stoves using natural gas or propane have begun offering higher-BTU burners. A few manufacturers of such stoves, notably Kenmore Appliances and Viking Range Corp. now include a specially designed high-output bridge-type wok burner as part of their standard or optional equipment, though even high-heat models are limited to a maximum of around 27,000 BTU (7.9 kW). </p>
<p> Because of the high cost of kitchen modifications, coupled with increased heat and smoke generated in the kitchen, more home chefs are using their wok outdoors on high-heat propane burners with curved wok support grates.[19] Many inexpensive propane burners are easily capable of 60,000–75,000 BTU (17.5–22 kW) or more, easily surpassing most in-home gas stoves. </p>
<p> Woks, be they round or flat bottomed, do not generally work well for stir-frying or other quick cooking methods when used on an electric cooker. These stoves do not produce the large amounts of quick even heat required for stir-frying. It is possible, however, to find round-shaped electric stove elements that will fit the curve of a wok, which allows the wok to be heated at its bottom along with part of its sides. A flat-bottomed wok may also work better on an electric stove. </p>
<p> Coupled with the lower heat retention of woks, meals stir-fried on electric stoves have a tendency to stew and boil when too much food is in the wok rather than "fry" as in traditional woks, thus not producing wok hei. A wok can, however, benefit from the slow steady heating of electric stoves when used for slower cooking methods such as stewing, braising, and steaming, and immersion cooking techniques such as frying and boiling. Many Chinese cooks use Western style cast-iron pans for stir-frying on electric stoves, since they hold enough heat for the required sustained high temperatures.[2] </p>
<p> A newer trend in woks is the electric wok, where no stove is needed. This type of wok is plugged into an electrical outlet and the heating element is in the wok. Like stove-mounted non-stick woks, these woks can also only be used at lower temperatures than traditional woks. </p>
<p> Induction cookers generate heat in induction-compatible cookware via direct magnetic stimulation of the pan material. While carbon steel and cast iron (the most common wok materials) are induction-compatible metals, induction cooking also requires close contact between the cooking vessel and the induction burner. This presents problems with tossing techniques, where the wok is lifted off the burner and agitated, will break contact and turn off the burner. Traditionally shaped woks, which are round-bottomed, also do not have enough contact with the cooking surface to generate notable heat. Bowl-shaped induction cookers overcome this problem and can be used suitably for wok cooking in locations where gas stoves are not suitable. </p>
<p> Flat-bottomed woks make sufficient contact to generate heat. Some cookware makers are now offering round-bottomed woks with a small flat spot to provide induction contact, with a specially designed support ring, and some induction cooktops are now also available with a rounded burner that is able to make contact with the rounded bottom of a traditional wok. In both cases, the food will need to be stirred with a cooking utensil, instead of being tossed by lifting the wok itself. </p>
<p> The main advantage of wok beyond its constructed material is its curved concave shape. The shape produces a small, hot area at the bottom which allows some of the food to be seared by intense heat while using relatively little fuel. The large sloped sides also make it easier for chefs to employ the tossing cooking technique on solid and thick liquid food with less spillage and a greater margin of safety. Curved sides also allow a person to cook without having to "chase the food around the pan" since bite-sized or finely chopped stir-fry ingredients usually tumble back to the center of the wok when agitated.[2] </p>
<p> The curve also provides a larger usable cooking surface versus Western-style pots and pans, which typically have vertical edges. This allows large pieces of food seared at the bottom of the wok to be pushed up the gently sloped sides to continue cooking at a slower rate. While this occurs another ingredient for the same dish needing high heat is being cooked at the bottom. The pointed bottom also allows even small amounts of oil to pool.[2] As such, large food items can be shallow fried, while finely chopped garlic, chili peppers, scallions, and ginger can be essentially deep-fried in both cases with very small amounts of cooking oil.[15] </p>

<p> Woman confused by traditional Lebanese salad thinks chef hasn’t bothered to chop it up </p>
<p> Share this with </p>
<p> A woman served a traditional unchopped Lebanese salad complained on the internet that it was ‘the world’s worst salad’, despite the manager telling her that the bowl of vegetables was an age-old Lebanese culinary tradition meant as a palate cleanser. </p>
<p> In what can only be put down to a cultural misunderstanding, Dawn Williams, of Liverpool, was baffled when she visited acclaimed restaurant Al Waha in Notting Hill, and was served the salad bowl, consisting of a whole tomato, cucumber, spring onions and half an iceberg lettuce, along with olives. </p>
<p> When she complained to the manager that they hadn’t chopped it up, he attempted to explain that it is customary in all Lebanese restaurants – from family run to the best Lebanese spots in Knightsbridge – to serve the raw salad in that way – but Dawn didn’t believe him. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Dawn, 45, who assumed she was being served the other salad she had ordered, but unprepared – said: ‘It was the worst salad in the world, absolutely. But it gave us 10 minutes of fun as it made us laugh out loud.’ </p>
<p> Dawn’s dining partner went on to post the photo on Imgur, where it was viewed thousands of times, with people calling the vegetable bowl a ‘deconstructed salad’ and ‘a DIY hipster salad’. </p>
<p> Seemingly none of them has ever been to a traditional Lebanese restaurant, because the unchopped salad really is a traditional opener to Lebanese meals, served with every meal from the family table up to the highest level restaurant. </p>
<p> Thousands are served every day at the incredibly popular Ranoush and Maroush restaurants, which are located in Kensington, King’s Road and Brompton Road, for instance. </p>
<p> One online review among many on Yelp has this to say about the salad bowls: ‘My favourite thing about Maroush is the fresh vegetable bowl that they leave table side for your munching pleasure. It’s filled to the brim with carrots, bell peppers, radishes, celery, lettuce, scallions, and tomatoes which are great accompaniments to the mezze.’ </p>
<p> The refreshing bowl of salad is meant as palate cleanser, to nibble on while other dishes come, or to eat alongside the flavour-rich dishes. It’s totally normal Dawn! </p>
<p> Frequent visitors to Lebanese restaurants welcome this part of the meal – it is generally low cost and comes with olives with a minimal cover charge. </p>
<p> The restaurant’s general manager was unoffended by Dawn’s reaction though, saying he found it ‘funny’ that the customer didn’t know that the dish was just a Lebanese starter of crudites ‘to get the palate going’. </p>
<p> Mohammad Antabli said: ‘If you go to the top Lebanese restaurants in the city, in London in Mayfair, and Knightsbridge, this is the way it’s always been served. It’s not any question about us. This is how the top restaurants do it.’ </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> But the mother-of-one, who was on a date with her boyfriend Tom, argued nonetheless that crudites are usually chopped and served with a dip. </p>
<p> An image of the plate, posted to Imgur, has since gone viral, with many online dubbing it as a ‘DIY hipster salad’. </p>
<p> The mother-of-one added: ‘I can’t believe the reaction online though. It’s gone global with all the shares. Everyone just thinks it’s hilarious – they can’t believe a place in Notting Hill is serving that. </p>
<p> ‘We considered getting a doggy bag for the salad so that we could take it home and restock our fridge with the unchopped veg, but my boyfriend refused to ask for one. </p>
<p> ‘Without a chopping board and vegetable knife, did they just expect us to eat the tomato like an apple?’ </p>
<p> Dawn and her lawyer boyfriend, 53, stumbled upon the swanky restaurant while looking for a Middle Eastern restaurant in the area on Friday, March 23. </p>
<p> The bowl was served with bread and olives as part of their £1.50 table cover. </p>
<p> Antabli explained: ‘A lot of people don’t understand the way our food should be eaten. </p>
<p> ‘The whole idea of the crudites is because we have a lot of different tastes and dishes so when you are eating these if you want to clean your palate from one to another, you can eat some lettuce or a slice of tomato to refresh your taste. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> ‘Even back home this is the way they do it – in Lebanon, in Syria, this is the way they present it. </p>
<p> ‘We try to explain it to people all the time and I don’t know why they get offended,’ but added that he was ‘quite amused’ about it. </p>

<p> Once in a Lifetime </p>
<p> The village of Huang Luo in China’s Guangxi Region is famous for the dramatically long hair worn by its female residents. </p>
<p> A thousand miles from Beijing, the village of Huang Luo in China’s Guangxi Region is famous for the dramatically long hair worn by its female residents. As legend has it, thousands of years ago a girl from the local Yao tribe literally whipped an unwelcome suitor with her hair, and to this day many of the Yao women cut their hair only once in their lives: When they are 18 it is shorn in a public ceremony. After that, the locks are left to grow to exuberant lengths, with the cutoff hair woven back into an elaborate coiffure. Unmarried women tuck their hair into a head scarf; married women favor a wrapped-up style with a large bun at the front. </p>
<p> These manes require special maintenance. The hair is washed—lowered, really—into rice water that has been combined with a few other organic ingredients. The mixture is boiled in a pot and then poured into an enamel bowl; a wooden comb is used to methodically work the solution into the hair from tip to root. This routine is said to be the reason for the hair’s preternatural shine and luster, and the way it remains pitch-black even when the possessor is quite elderly. </p>
<p> Until the 1980s, local lore warned that if a man saw an unmarried girl with her hair down, he would be forced to serve the girl’s family for three years. Now everyone can gaze upon these luxuriant locks without fear of consequences: Huang Luo village itself has become a tourist attraction. The town has even built a theater, where residents don traditional costumes, perform folk songs and dances, and demonstrate how their hair is washed and coiffed. (The revenue from ticket sales provides most of the village’s income; visitors can also purchase bottles of the rice water shampoo.) </p>
<p> Photographer Joyce Ng spent a third of her time on this project in the main village, but she also went to two less traveled places, located in the rice terraces surrounding Huang Luo, and many of these photographs are from these smaller hamlets. When she arrived in the area, Ng was surprised to find so few women in their teens and early 20s—most of them were off at school, the only way to escape the region’s poverty. And once they leave the village, most of them do cut their hair. When Ng asked older people how they felt about the girls abandoning the hair ritual, she was surprised that they were actually very relaxed about it. “They say it’s everyone’s choice. They are so open-minded,” she says. And even those who keep to the tradition and perform for audiences, dressed in their colorful ensembles, are also fully at home in the modern world: “They wear jeans,” Ng reports, “and they are all on WeChat.” </p>

<p> Pan Gui Jiao washes her hair twice a week with a glutinous rice water solution. Packed with eight amino acids and vitamins B, C, and E, it strengthens hair, moisturizes the scalp, and promotes growth.

<p> Like many Yao ladies, Pan Gui Jiao doesn’t blame young girls who abandon their long-hair after they leave home and start working in the city. Despite their rich cultural traditions, their hair does not define them. </p>

The seafood was so fresh, and the lobster was the freshest and sweetest I have ever had. While the seafood was the highlight of the meal, my petit filet mignon was cooked to order and it was successful. All the food was delicious ? the drinks were strong and tasty too.

<p> Introduction </p>
<p> to Cast Iron Cooking </p>
<p> Cooking with Cast Iron </p>
<p> Cast iron cookware has been used for over two thousand years and is valued for its durability, its ability to retain heat, and to maintain an evenly cooked item especially over uneven heat; thus improving the quality of the food. Cast iron's ability to withstand and maintain very high cooking temperatures makes it a common choice for searing (such as our steaks) to lock in the juices. Cast iron pans are cast as a single piece of metal, including the handle which allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Our chefs initially sear on the stovetop and then transfer certain entrees into the oven, pan and all, to finish. </p>
<p> Seasoning a cast iron pan is imperative; a process by which a layer of fat or vegetable oil is applied and cooked onto cast iron pan. A proper cast iron seasoning protects the cookware from rusting, provides a non-stick surface for cooking, prevents food from interacting with the iron of the pan and enhances the flavor of the meat. </p>
<p> Attilio, the Cast Iron Chef, has spent over 14 years developing his recipes used with the cast iron pans and his reward has been the phenomenal accolades being given by customers who have provided written testimonies to the meals they have experienced. </p>

<p> Frittatas have always been a regular staple in my house, for as long as I can remember my whole married life I’ve been making them. Over the years my technique has evolved and I probably can make them in my sleep now. </p>
<p> What I like about frittatas is that they make a hearty breakfast, they can become an amazing brunch, a very satisfying lunch and a casual and light dinner. </p>
<p> Right now as I write this we are all living in uncharted waters, trying to navigate our lives through this horrible virus that’s attacking the earth. We want to nurture our loved ones and cooking is one of the ways to do that. </p>
<p> Frittatas don’t take a lot of energy to make, and in times of stress that’s a good thing. You don’t need to go out and buy fancy ingredients, in fact you’d be surprised how little you actually need. The key ingredients would be of course eggs, maybe some leftover veggies you don’t want to waste or some odds and ends of cheese wrapped up in the fridge. All these things can be transformed into an amazing meal to feed your family. </p>
<p> I hope to give you some inspiration with some of the ingredients I’ve used. The above frittata was made with a yellow pepper, cherry tomatoes, prosciutto, fontina and pecorino. </p>
<p> My caprese frittata made here with the three basics ingredients of tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil, I could eat this anytime of the day. </p>
<p> Keep in mind if you make these throughout the year like I do, no doubt you’ll be using seasonal veggies as well. </p>
<p> This frittata is a hearty meal of pre-cooked crumbled Italian sausage, roasted butternut squash, a handful of spinach, pecorino and shredded mozzarella. </p>
<p> I actually made this one the other day with some leftover cooked artichoke hearts that I had, a few stalks of roasted asparagus with some cherry tomatoes. </p>
<p> One ingredient constant in all my frittatas is grated pecorino, to me its like Emeril’s ”BAM !” </p>
<p> This one has a Greek flavor profile with feta cheese, red onion and tomato wedges, feta is fantastic in frittatas! </p>
<p> I love squash and delicata squash is no exception, I make it during the fall and winter a lot by roasting it, and always have leftovers. Here it is with roasted cauliflower and spinach. This time I used cheddar with a mix of mozzarella and pecorino of course, because what can I say, it just enhances the whole frittata! </p>
<p> Oh and yes you can eat the delicate skin on the squash! </p>
<p> My go to pan is always an oven safe skillet, mostly 10 inch, sometimes 12 inch but I’ve also made them in a quarter sheet pan which is fun. You can have fun creating a little scene with all the veggies, great if you’re feeding a group, just double the egg amount. </p>
<p> This one is filled with fresh roasted asparagus, a handful of frozen peas, red onion, herbs, cherry tomatoes with pecorino and mozzarella. </p>
<p> I call this my spring frittata, it has beautiful melted brie cheese with shaved asparagus, peas and cherry tomatoes. The shaved asparagus gives it a really special look and it tastes amazing! </p>
<p> Pan sautéed zucchini coins with cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, pecorino and cheddar. </p>
<p> Hearty and delicious roasted brussels sprouts leaves with cooked chopped bacon, mozzarella and pecorino. </p>
<p> When tomato season is here remember this frittata made with sliced heirlooms, cheddar, pecorino and basil. </p>
<p> I look forward to making this when delicate zucchini blossoms start to appear along with sautéed zucchini coins, pecorino, basil and fresh mozzarella. </p>
<p> Speaking of zucchini, this frittata is made with spiralized zucchini, fresh herbs, tomato slices, mozzarella, pecorino and shaved parm on top. </p>
<p> Roasted mini colored peppers with peas, pecorino and mozzarella with a green salad plopped on top, which by the way is a fun way to eat a frittata. </p>
<p> I often mix up some arugula with just lemon and olive oil and plop it on top of mine. </p>
<p> Roasted broccolini with red pepper, mushrooms, fresh mozzarella and pecorino. </p>
<p> And lastly an earthy frittata made with shiitake mushrooms, goat cheese and spinach, feel free to use any mushroom you have, leaving some whole for a nice presentation. </p>
<p> HERE ARE SOME OF MY TIPS AND TRICKS FOR MAKING FOOL PROOF FRITTATAS. </p>
<p> Always use an oven proof skillet ( 10 inch if you want it thicker, 12 inch if you want it thinner) </p>
<p> Have pre-cooked fillings ready ( you can use frozen veggies if that’s all you have, just saute them in a little olive oil for flavor) </p>
<p> Use fresh tomatoes and herbs </p>
<p> Use various cheeses of your choice ( cheddar, mozzarella, fresh or shredded, brie, feta, fontina, gouda, you get the picture) </p>
<p> Use 6 eggs scrambled with a dash of water from the tap ( I never use milk or cream in my frittatas) </p>
<p> Start out by drizzling olive oil in the bottom of your pan, if using onions start out sauteing them first then place your veggies all around the way you want your frittata to look, sort of like painting on a canvas. </p>
<p> Pour your scrambled eggs gently over the tops of your veg. </p>
<p> Heat should be medium lowish </p>
<p> Sprinkle with grated pecorino or parmesan </p>
<p> Add some salt and black pepper </p>
<p> Heat up your broiler. </p>
<p> When the eggs start to set a little it’s time for the broiler, so shut the flame off the stove. At this time I like to take some tongs and gently lift up some of my vegetables, otherwise they all get buried under the egg mixture and you won’t have a pretty presentation or see any of the veg popping out. </p>
<p> Next you want to strategically place whatever cheese you’re using all around trying not to bury everything, then add maybe a quick drizzle of olive oil and some more pecorino. </p>
<p> Speaking of broiler, I always finish my frittatas under the broiler, I’m not a flipper, I prefer the presentation you achieve from using the broiler. </p>
<p> One important note; don’t leave the broiler! keep opening the door to see how golden it’s getting, ovens vary so don’t leave the scene! You want a nice golden color from the melted cheese. </p>
<p> Test the center to see if any egg runs, if so put it back in for a few seconds. </p>
<p> Take it out and let it rest for 5 or 10 minutes, garnish with herbs if you like. </p>
<p> Frittatas can be eaten warm, at room temperature, or cold right from the fridge. </p>
<p> To round out the meal even more you can add some crusty bread and a salad. </p>
<p> Are you looking for some inspiration while planning for your Easter dessert? Well here are 10 of my favorites! Each and very one I have made for family and friends and all have been a big hit! </p>
<p> Let’s start out with this dreamy Limoncello Tiramisu. It’s bright and delicious and the perfect ending to a great meal. This particular recipe can be made in individual parfait glasses or in a 9×13 inch pan like featured above, all you have to do is double the recipe! </p>
<p> Cannoli Pie, I call it a pie because it’s actually a take on another Easter pie that I make. </p>
<p> This special dessert is made in a spring form pan which allows you to press broken cannoli shells easily against the wall of the pan in forming the crust. You can make it a day ahead then adorn the top with all things cannoli, like pistachios, mini chocolate chips and powdered sugar. </p>
<p> Italian Anise Cookies, these are a staple in many Italian homes, usually made often for any type of celebration and holidays. The nice thing about these cookies is the fact that you can decorate them according to whatever occasion it is. </p>
<p> The pastel colors scream winter is gone and spring is upon us! I promise they’ll be the perfect addition to your Easter table. </p>
<p> This pound cake has a bright and bold flavorful glaze that mixes three different citrus zests together, and the texture of the cake is amazing, plus I think it gives a pretty awesome presentation. </p>
<p> Easter Lamb Cake. Lamb cakes have been a tradition for years and years at Easter time. Yes, you can buy them at bakeries and grocery stores around the holiday, but have you ever wanted to make your own? </p>
<p> I had a dear friend show me step by step how she makes her old school recipe which she’s been making for over 50 years! Get the kids involved in the decorating it would be a nice tradition to start in your own family as well. </p>
<p> Check out her delicious pound cake recipe that she uses. </p>
<p> Strawberry Tiramisu, I love a rich and creamy tiramisu. You can change up the berries using which ones that you like or even do a mixed berry version. </p>
<p> I have a confession to make, I never make my tiramisu with raw eggs, I prefer it without. </p>
<p> Limoncello Tart. ( Can you tell I love Limoncello?) This one has a crust that’s made with crushed amaretti cookies and it’s served with a blueberry sauce on the side. </p>
<p> It’s an amazing combination and a real show stopper! </p>
<p> They’ll look nice and pretty set out on your Easter dessert table, everyone loves a ricotta cookie, so light and refreshing! </p>
<p> My little twist uses a phyllo crust which is very forgiving. The contrast between the creamy and the crunchy is out of this world good! </p>
<p> A very traditional Easter dessert with a little updated twist. </p>
<p> Anginetti, Italian Lemon Knot Cookies. This cookie goes by many names but one thing that remains the same is the taste. Intense lemon flavor with a soft texture to the bite. Another special occasion cookie and just perfect for Easter time. </p>
<p> I hope I’ve given you some inspiration with some of these Easter dessert options. </p>

<p> Easter is around the corner and I can’t think of a better side dish to have sitting next to your Easter ham. It’s a potato salad made with those pretty colored fingerling potatoes. It showcases a special creamy vinaigrette made with honey, lemon and Djon. The vinaigrette is the perfect compliment to the fingerlings because their light and mild flesh makes the flavors easy to absorb. </p>
<p> The flavors are bright and slightly tangy with a lighter version of a traditional potato salad. This salad can safely sit out and be served at room temperature because it’s made without mayonnaise, so keep this potato salad in mind for future BBQ’s, parties and picnics. </p>
<p> Adding hard boiled eggs, your favorite olives, parsley and sliced green onions round out all the flavors in this hearty potato salad. </p>
<p> Seek out fingerlings that are about the same size because you want them all to cook evenly together, sometimes you’ll see some larger ones in the mix. </p>
<p> Fingerlings boil up fast so be careful not to overcook them. You want the tip of a knife to go through easily but not so much so that the potato falls apart when poking it. Be mindful of that, so keep checking for doneness so they don’t fall apart and get mushy. </p>
<p> The vinaigrette is dreamy, you might want to double the recipe and have extra in the fridge so you can use it for a bunch of other dishes! </p>
<p> A while ago I ordered these balsamic pearls on line but never got around to using them, since they were lemon flavored I thought they would be a nice addition to this potato salad. This is totally optional, no need to add it to the recipe at all, but they are sort of fun! </p>
<p> Look closely, you’ll see them sitting on the surface. </p>
<p> Feel free to make this salad your own with inspiration of seasonal veggies like asparagus, peas, green beans or even corn, and maybe switching up some herbs and adding some arugula, all would go well with the flavors of honey, lemon and Djon. </p>
<p> I hope you seek out some of those vibrant fingerlings and make this delicious potato salad customized by you! </p>
<p> Follow Proud Italian Cook on Instagram to see what else I’m cooking up during the week. </p>
<p> Fingerling Potato Salad with Honey, Lemon and Djon </p>
<p> 2 lbs. vibrant colored fingerling potatoes, roughly same size and cut in half lengthwise </p>
<p> 3 or 4 hardboiled eggs halved or quartered, your choice </p>
<p> Whisk together all of the vinaigrette ingredients in a bowl, taste to your liking, maybe you want it sweeter, add more honey, more tart, add a splash more vinegar or lemon juice or even more olive oil, then set aside. </p>
<p> Wash your potatoes really well. </p>
<p> Place them into cold water and let them reach a boil, then turn down heat to a medium simmer. </p>
<p> Test potatoes for doneness you don't want them mushy as stated in the post. </p>
<p> When finished cooking drain them and place the warm potatoes gently into a large serving dish. </p>
<p> Sprinkle in the green onions and olives all around the potatoes and arranging the hard boiled eggs. </p>
<p> Spoon the vinaigrette all over the warm potatoes so that flavors can absorb. </p>
<p> Taste and determine if salt and added pepper is needed, maybe sprinkle in more parsley, onions and olives as well. </p>

<p> OUR RESTAURANT </p>
<p> Deemed by local food critics as having one of Orange County’s best burgers, we've enjoyed a successful three-year run with our food truck before venturing to open our first brick & mortar location at Westpark Plaza in the city of Irvine, CA. </p>
<p> ​ </p>
<p> When we launched as a food truck in 2014, our mission was to deliver simple burgers without all the gimmicks and overly complicated toppings. We partnered with Chef Andres Dangond (who has cooked all over the world including several Michelin-starred restaurants like Alinea and L2O in Chicago), and created a straightforward menu of signature handcrafted burgers made with all-natural, certified humane and free-range meats that are also hormone- and antibiotic-free. </p>
<p> ​ </p>
<p> Our new menu includes our already famous Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings, Spanish Chorizo Croquettes, Smoked Mac & Cheese, and a couple of great desserts, like our Corn Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Dulce de Leche. </p>
<p> We also have a great selection of local craft beers, wine and an exciting cocktail menu. </p>

<p> Founded as a food truck, The Cut has taken OC by storm, being named OC Register’s “Critic’s Choice Best Food Truck” in 2015 and nominated “Best Burger in OC” for 2016. In 2017, The Cut evolves into a Burger focused restaurant, with a casual, urban and rustic setting, offering American Fare with a refreshing global influence by Chef Andres Dangond. The Cut's Burgers are all natural, certified humane, free range, hormone and antibiotic free Angus beef, ground in house. Created for burger enthusiasts craving high quality, The Cut truly handcrafts some of the best burgers you’ll find today. In addition to, what many call, “The best Burger they’ve ever had” you will be able to enjoy sandwiches, salads and shareable plates like Honey Sriracha Chicken Wings, Serrano Ham Croquettes, Smoked Mac & Cheese, desserts like our phenomenal Bread Pudding and an amazing Brunch menu on the weekends. The Cut's philosophy, of quality, freshness and tradition remains. Continued use of locally sourced, all natural ingredients, and an artisanal approach with from-scratch cooking will now be paired with an amazing, local craft beer & wine selection. </p>

<doc id="file14874863" filename="Yubitsume" parent_folder="web1" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yubitsume">
<p> Yubitsume (指詰め, "finger shortening") is a Japanese ritual to atone for offenses to another, a way to be punished or to show sincere apology and remorse to another, by means of amputating portions of one's own little finger. In modern times, it is primarily performed by the yakuza, one of the most prominent Japanese criminal organizations. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> The ritual is thought to have originated with the bakuto, itinerant gamblers who were predecessors of the modern yakuza.[1] If a person was unable to pay off a gambling debt, yubitsume was sometimes considered an alternative form of repayment.[1] </p>
<p> In Japanese swordsmanship, or Kendo, the little finger's grip is the tightest on the hilt. A little finger-amputee was therefore unable to grip his sword properly, weakening him in battle and making him more dependent on the protection of his boss.[1] </p>
<p> To perform yubitsume, one lays down a small clean cloth and lays the hand onto the cloth facing down. Using an extremely sharp knife, or tantō, the person cuts off the portion of his left little finger above the top knuckle on the finger or the tip of the finger. He then wraps the severed portion in the cloth and submits the "package" very graciously to his oyabun ("godfather" or boss), who is also referred to as a kumicho (gang-leader). </p>
<p> If more offenses are committed, then the person moves on to the next joint of the finger to perform yubitsume. More infractions could mean removing portions of the right little finger when no more joints of the left finger remain. In some cases, a person expelled from a yakuza gang might be required to perform the yubitsume ritual. </p>
<p> The finger of the yakuza directly responsible for an offense is called an iki yubi, "living finger", while the finger of the yakuza that is directly in charge of him is called a shinu yubi, "dead finger". </p>
